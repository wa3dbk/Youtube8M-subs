00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
routine but I sort of broken for away

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.420 
routine but I sort of broken for away
from<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.469> regimen<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.340> bit

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
from that regimen just for a little bit

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
from that regimen just for a little bit
because<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> couple<00:01:00.420> injuries<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because I had a couple injuries and I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.209 
because I had a couple injuries and I
wasn't<00:01:01.260> trying<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.680> many<00:01:01.800> strengths

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
wasn't trying to do as many strengths

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
wasn't trying to do as many strengths
days<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> started<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> different

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
days so I started doing a different

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
days so I started doing a different
style<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.549> low<00:01:05.670> high<00:01:05.820> low<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.210> still

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
style of the low high low so it's still

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
style of the low high low so it's still
the<00:01:06.420> same<00:01:06.479> date<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.350> far<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.860> chest<00:01:08.250> shoulders

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the same date as far as chest shoulders

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
the same date as far as chest shoulders
back<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:09.210> try<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> then<00:01:09.930> legs<00:01:10.280> except<00:01:11.280> now

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
back by try and then legs except now

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.710 
back by try and then legs except now
instead<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.909> doing<00:01:12.119> strength<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
instead of doing strength and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
instead of doing strength and
high-intensity<00:01:13.530> days<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:14.130> generally<00:01:14.760> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
high-intensity days I'm generally just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.649 
high-intensity days I'm generally just
doing<00:01:15.270> maybe<00:01:16.020> two<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.040> five<00:01:17.369> sets<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.030> strength

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
doing maybe two to five sets of strength

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749 
doing maybe two to five sets of strength
and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.320> finishing<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.369> everything

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and then finishing up with everything

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
and then finishing up with everything
else<00:01:21.030> being<00:01:21.270> high<00:01:21.509> rep<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> pump<00:01:22.799> in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440 
else being high rep to get a pump in
afterwards<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> can't<00:01:23.790> say<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.270> it's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
afterwards now I can't say that it's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
afterwards now I can't say that it's
really<00:01:24.840> better<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.680> worse<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:26.700> just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
strength work as possible and and while
I<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.049> cut<00:01:34.530> i'm<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:34.799> try<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I like actually cut i'm gonna try to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
I like actually cut i'm gonna try to
retain<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.520> much<00:01:35.549> strength<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:35.970> possible<00:01:36.329> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
retain as much strength as possible so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.210 
retain as much strength as possible so
i'm<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> follow<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.960> same<00:01:37.200> style<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
i'm going to follow this same style of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
i'm going to follow this same style of
routine<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.500> keep

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
routine just so I can see if I can keep

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
routine just so I can see if I can keep
the<00:01:41.490> weights<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> moving<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.810> then

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the weights that I'm moving up and then

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
the weights that I'm moving up and then
finish<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.280> pumping<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> always

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
finish out with pumping because I always

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
finish out with pumping because I always
feel<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.479> pump<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.399> important<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.670> for

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
feel like a pump is important to get for

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.190 
feel like a pump is important to get for
me<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> least<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> notice<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
me at least now you notice that the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480 
me at least now you notice that the
weight<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.829> heavy<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.340> might

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
weight is not as heavy as you might

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
weight is not as heavy as you might
think<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.820> decline<00:01:51.119> would<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.020> when

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
think a decline would be for me but when

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
think a decline would be for me but when
I<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.649> concentrate<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> negatives

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I really concentrate on the negatives

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
I really concentrate on the negatives
with<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> lighter<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> medium<00:01:55.439> weight<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> do

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with a lighter to a medium weight and do

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
with a lighter to a medium weight and do
a<00:01:56.250> higher<00:01:56.490> rep<00:01:56.759> scheme<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.390> 216<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
a higher rep scheme like well 216 I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
a higher rep scheme like well 216 I
really<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> good<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.430> good<00:01:59.610> good<00:01:59.969> pump

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
really get a good good good good pump

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
really get a good good good good pump
now<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> guys<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.649> this

of<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:08.819> favorite<00:02:09.390> exercises<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:10.080> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> sweet

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
of my favorite exercises I get a sweet

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.920 
of my favorite exercises I get a sweet
contraction<00:02:11.400> throughout<00:02:11.610> my

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
contraction throughout my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.690 
contraction throughout my
hiya<00:02:12.049> Peck<00:02:12.349> now<00:02:12.799> we're<00:02:12.950> what<00:02:13.280> we're<00:02:13.400> doing<00:02:13.609> in

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
hiya Peck now we're what we're doing in

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.849 
hiya Peck now we're what we're doing in
our<00:02:13.879> partner<00:02:14.209> reps<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.810> LP<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.379> actually

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
our partner reps so LP is actually

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.830 
our partner reps so LP is actually
pushing<00:02:16.280> against<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.700> wait<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.450> these<00:02:17.569> first

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
pushing against the wait for these first

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.170 
pushing against the wait for these first
I<00:02:17.989> think<00:02:18.200> eight<00:02:18.349> reps<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.819> to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
I think eight reps and that's on the to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.270 
I think eight reps and that's on the to
get<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.420> hell<00:02:20.599> out<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.379> finish<00:02:22.069> out

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
get the hell out of here and finish out

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.860 
get the hell out of here and finish out
with<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.579> last<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:23.060> think<00:02:23.269> eight<00:02:23.450> reps<00:02:23.689> and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
with the last I think eight reps and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.030 
with the last I think eight reps and
this<00:02:24.079> is<00:02:24.230> great<00:02:24.409> to<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.590> with<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.769> partner

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
this is great to do with your partner

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.470 
this is great to do with your partner
because<00:02:25.159> you're<00:02:25.579> getting<00:02:25.760> additional<00:02:26.030> weight

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
because you're getting additional weight

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000 
because you're getting additional weight
in<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.689> first<00:02:27.019> part<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.319> your<00:02:27.379> set<00:02:27.650> then<00:02:27.859> when

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
in the first part of your set then when

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.470 
in the first part of your set then when
you<00:02:28.099> could<00:02:28.250> seek<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.639> of<00:02:28.879> being<00:02:29.090> able<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.359> do

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you could seek out of being able to do

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.479 
you could seek out of being able to do
that<00:02:29.629> wait<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.230> immediately<00:02:30.799> relieved<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
that wait it's immediately relieved and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.800 
that wait it's immediately relieved and
you're<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:31.969> working<00:02:32.180> with<00:02:32.420> your<00:02:32.629> original

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you're just working with your original

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.170 
you're just working with your original
weight<00:02:33.260> again<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.829> I<00:02:33.859> usually<00:02:34.340> like<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.549> end<00:02:34.939> my

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
weight again so I usually like to end my

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.229 
weight again so I usually like to end my
chest<00:02:35.780> workout<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:36.859> some<00:02:37.099> sort<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.340> pump<00:02:37.700> so

either dumbbell flyes or cable flyes and
for<00:02:41.750> me<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.019> just<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.739> just<00:02:42.920> feels<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.340> best

can<00:04:20.450> really<00:04:20.660> concentrate<00:04:20.930> on<00:04:21.320> squeezing<00:04:21.709> your

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
can really concentrate on squeezing your

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.320 
can really concentrate on squeezing your
results<00:04:22.340> now<00:04:22.610> here's<00:04:22.789> something<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.150> like

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
results now here's something that I like

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.510 
results now here's something that I like
putting<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:23.840> recently<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.889> do<00:04:25.010> use<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
putting in recently is you do use the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.279 
putting in recently is you do use the
same<00:04:25.729> crossover<00:04:26.270> cable<00:04:26.539> machine<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.080> put

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
same crossover cable machine but you put

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.870 
same crossover cable machine but you put
the<00:04:27.320> pulleys<00:04:27.710> at<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.950> very<00:04:28.130> bottom<00:04:28.340> setting

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
the pulleys at the very bottom setting

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
the pulleys at the very bottom setting
and<00:04:29.030> then<00:04:29.660> you're<00:04:29.840> just<00:04:29.870> pulling<00:04:30.410> up<00:04:30.680> just

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
and then you're just pulling up just

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.560 
and then you're just pulling up just
like<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.190> dumbbell<00:04:31.639> lateral<00:04:31.880> raise<00:04:32.150> but<00:04:32.419> with

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
like a dumbbell lateral raise but with

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.000 
like a dumbbell lateral raise but with
cables<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.139> with<00:04:33.260> cables<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.800> going<00:04:33.919> to

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
cables now with cables it's going to

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.670 
cables now with cables it's going to
cause<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> constant<00:04:35.030> stress<00:04:35.360> stress<00:04:36.050> because

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
cause a constant stress stress because

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.560 
cause a constant stress stress because
there's<00:04:36.889> no<00:04:37.250> momentum<00:04:37.760> change<00:04:38.240> when<00:04:38.450> you're

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
there's no momentum change when you're

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.879 
there's no momentum change when you're
using<00:04:38.720> dumbbells<00:04:39.050> when<00:04:39.380> you're<00:04:39.470> using<00:04:39.590> free

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
using dumbbells when you're using free

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.440 
using dumbbells when you're using free
weights<00:04:40.010> there's<00:04:40.610> momentum<00:04:40.910> change<00:04:41.300> as

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
weights there's momentum change as

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.480 
weights there's momentum change as
you're<00:04:41.720> going<00:04:41.840> up<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> stress

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
you're going up and down so the stress

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.159 
you're going up and down so the stress
is<00:04:43.610> different<00:04:44.000> oh<00:04:44.150> these<00:04:44.450> cables<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:44.930> just

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
is different oh these cables you just

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.020 
is different oh these cables you just
get<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.349> really<00:04:46.190> nice<00:04:46.340> pump<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.789> it's<00:04:46.910> really

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
get a really nice pump and it's really

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.140 
get a really nice pump and it's really
hard<00:04:47.120> now<00:04:47.690> this<00:04:48.080> exercise<00:04:48.620> or<00:04:49.150> workout

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
I fatigue when i do that isometric plus

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.450 
I fatigue when i do that isometric plus
i<00:05:12.169> want<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.380> do<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.470> little<00:05:12.680> bit<00:05:12.860> more<00:05:12.979> reps<00:05:13.250> then

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
i want to do a little bit more reps then

i want to do the isometric hold and then

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.260 
i want to do the isometric hold and then
you<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:15.650> go<00:05:15.770> straight<00:05:16.010> into<00:05:16.250> your<00:05:16.370> next<00:05:16.820> set

hold you can do another dumbbell set
whatever<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.500> want<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.710> do<00:05:21.860> but<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.490> usually

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
whatever you want to do but I usually

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.870 
whatever you want to do but I usually
stop<00:05:23.479> at<00:05:23.690> two<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.320> my<00:05:24.500> arms<00:05:24.830> are<00:05:24.919> just<00:05:25.159> pumped

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
stop at two and my arms are just pumped

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.159 
stop at two and my arms are just pumped
and<00:05:26.000> fatigue<00:05:26.630> so

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
and fatigue so

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.529 
and fatigue so
for<00:05:27.289> that<00:05:27.349> we<00:05:27.710> hit<00:05:27.889> shrugs<00:05:28.279> for<00:05:28.639> our<00:05:28.759> traps<00:05:29.120> we

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
for that we hit shrugs for our traps we

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:30.640 
for that we hit shrugs for our traps we
already<00:05:29.689> hit<00:05:29.900> our<00:05:30.020> rear<00:05:30.169> delts<00:05:30.409> where<00:05:30.529> to<00:05:30.590> hit

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
already hit our rear delts where to hit

already hit our rear delts where to hit
our<00:05:30.800> middle<00:05:30.979> delts<00:05:31.189> I<00:05:31.249> usually<00:05:31.580> keep<00:05:31.879> front

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
our middle delts I usually keep front

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.939 
our middle delts I usually keep front
delts<00:05:32.629> out<00:05:32.749> of<00:05:32.960> my<00:05:33.080> shoulder<00:05:33.289> workouts<00:05:33.680> just

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
delts out of my shoulder workouts just

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.050 
delts out of my shoulder workouts just
because<00:05:34.159> they're<00:05:34.279> already<00:05:34.550> getting<00:05:34.699> such<00:05:35.029> a

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
because they're already getting such a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.700 
because they're already getting such a
big<00:05:35.180> stimulation<00:05:35.990> when<00:05:36.110> you're<00:05:36.229> doing<00:05:36.379> chest

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
big stimulation when you're doing chest

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.439 
big stimulation when you're doing chest
and<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.759> lot<00:05:37.879> of<00:05:37.909> people<00:05:38.060> are<00:05:38.270> just

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
and a lot of people are just

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.939 
and a lot of people are just
aggressively<00:05:39.080> overdeveloped<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.830> their
