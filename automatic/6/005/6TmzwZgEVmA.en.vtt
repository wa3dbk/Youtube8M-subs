00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
the pressure that our air pump can put

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.990 
the pressure that our air pump can put
out<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.990> we've<00:03:29.800> done<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.160> test<00:03:30.430> enough<00:03:30.730> times

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
out so we've done this test enough times

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.970 
out so we've done this test enough times
in<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.300> store<00:03:31.570> for<00:03:31.959> customers<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.860> to

permeability between the various fabrics

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.699 
permeability between the various fabrics
that<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.930> exactly<00:03:38.440> what<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
that you know this is exactly what I

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.310 
that you know this is exactly what I
expected<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.480> let's<00:03:40.840> move<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.620> test<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:43.510> neo

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
expected so let's move on and test a neo

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.020 
expected so let's move on and test a neo
shell<00:03:44.650> versus<00:03:45.100> event<00:03:45.520> just<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.790> get<00:03:46.000> a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
shell versus event just to get a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.630

comparison<00:03:46.660> between<00:03:46.750> those<00:03:47.080> two

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120 

okay<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.870> I've<00:03:52.050> changed<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.620> jackets

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
okay so now I've changed out the jackets

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.960 
okay so now I've changed out the jackets
that<00:03:53.190> are<00:03:53.280> hooked<00:03:53.490> up<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> air

which<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.740> yellow<00:04:01.890> Jack<00:04:02.220> on<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.640> side

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
which is the yellow Jack on this side

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.580 
which is the yellow Jack on this side
and<00:04:03.230> both<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.290> them<00:04:04.650> are<00:04:04.920> easily<00:04:05.790> moving<00:04:06.180> air

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
and both of them are easily moving air

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.790 
and both of them are easily moving air
through<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.740> fabric<00:04:08.240> it's<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.450> little<00:04:09.900> less

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
through the fabric it's a little less

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.320 
through the fabric it's a little less
obvious<00:04:11.130> because<00:04:11.580> they're<00:04:11.850> both<00:04:12.000> doing<00:04:12.180> a

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
obvious because they're both doing a

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.600 
obvious because they're both doing a
pretty<00:04:12.870> good<00:04:13.080> job<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.650> but<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> look

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
pretty good job at it but if you look

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.030 
pretty good job at it but if you look
closely<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.660> can<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.320> neo<00:04:16.590> shell

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
closely you can see that the neo shell

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.390 
closely you can see that the neo shell
jacket<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:18.090> allowing<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.780> air<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.620> move

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
jacket is allowing more air to move

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.590 
jacket is allowing more air to move
through<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.560> fabric<00:04:26.030> all<00:04:27.030> right<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.419> what

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
through the fabric all right so what

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.590 
through the fabric all right so what
does<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:27.960> prove<00:04:28.430> well<00:04:29.430> in<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.940> itself<00:04:30.330> it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
does this prove well in and of itself it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.900 
does this prove well in and of itself it
just<00:04:30.630> demonstrates<00:04:31.400> air<00:04:32.400> permeability

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
just demonstrates air permeability

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.380 
just demonstrates air permeability
through<00:04:33.630> these<00:04:33.870> various<00:04:34.260> jackets<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:36.180> the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
through these various jackets so the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.630 
through these various jackets so the
argument<00:04:36.900> comes<00:04:37.080> out<00:04:37.290> -<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.980> valid<00:04:38.430> test

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
argument comes out - is it a valid test

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.730 
argument comes out - is it a valid test
or<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.940> meaningful<00:04:39.330> test<00:04:39.750> well<00:04:40.290> that's<00:04:40.470> really

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
or a meaningful test well that's really

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.000 
or a meaningful test well that's really
up<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.310> decide<00:04:41.850> in<00:04:42.720> my<00:04:42.900> opinion<00:04:43.290> air

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
up to you to decide in my opinion air

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.060 
up to you to decide in my opinion air
permeability<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:45.000> meaningful<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:47.040> know

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
permeability is meaningful you know

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.830 
permeability is meaningful you know
there<00:04:47.370> have<00:04:47.460> been<00:04:47.520> other<00:04:47.850> ways<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.390> try<00:04:48.660> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
there have been other ways to try and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.710 
there have been other ways to try and
test<00:04:49.400> breathability<00:04:50.400> which<00:04:50.970> we<00:04:51.270> really<00:04:51.570> don't

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
test breathability which we really don't

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.060 
test breathability which we really don't
like<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.050> use<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.440> term<00:04:52.590> breathability

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
like to use the term breathability

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.560 
like to use the term breathability
that's<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.640> term<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.090> industry

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
that's the term that the industry

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.320 
that's the term that the industry
commonly<00:04:55.020> uses<00:04:55.440> there's<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.550> test<00:04:57.030> where<00:04:57.240> you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
commonly uses there's the test where you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.290 
commonly uses there's the test where you
place<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> hot<00:04:58.110> saucer<00:04:58.950> of<00:04:59.250> water<00:04:59.760> underneath

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
place a hot saucer of water underneath

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.900 
place a hot saucer of water underneath
the<00:05:00.540> jacket<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.260> watch<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.070> steam<00:05:02.370> migrate

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
the jacket and watch the steam migrate

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.130 
the jacket and watch the steam migrate
through<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.740> really<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.919> comes<00:05:05.250> down<00:05:05.430> to

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
through it really this comes down to

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.370 
through it really this comes down to
putting<00:05:07.140> each<00:05:07.530> one<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.860> these<00:05:07.950> jackets<00:05:08.250> on

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
putting each one of these jackets on

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.290 
putting each one of these jackets on
usually<00:05:10.380> over<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.979> base<00:05:11.310> layer<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.880> mid<00:05:12.090> layer

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
usually over a base layer in a mid layer

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.909 
usually over a base layer in a mid layer
or<00:05:12.450> sometimes<00:05:12.780> just<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:13.200> base<00:05:13.380> layer<00:05:13.650> and

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
or sometimes just a base layer and

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.920 
or sometimes just a base layer and
running<00:05:14.760> up<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:14.970> side<00:05:15.180> of<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.390> mountain<00:05:15.570> and

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
running up the side of the mountain and

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.200 
running up the side of the mountain and
just<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.410> which<00:05:16.710> one<00:05:17.010> performs<00:05:17.610> better<00:05:17.880> for

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
just see which one performs better for

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.140 
just see which one performs better for
you<00:05:18.360> which<00:05:19.140> one<00:05:19.470> removes<00:05:20.040> your<00:05:20.490> body<00:05:20.790> moisture

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
you which one removes your body moisture

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.200 
you which one removes your body moisture
and<00:05:21.810> humidity<00:05:22.229> away<00:05:22.950> from<00:05:23.220> your<00:05:23.370> body<00:05:23.550> through

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
and humidity away from your body through

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.480 
and humidity away from your body through
the<00:05:24.630> fabric<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.350> out<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.890> environment

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
the fabric and out to the environment

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.330 
the fabric and out to the environment
and<00:05:26.900> since<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.990> do<00:05:28.050> own<00:05:28.470> each<00:05:28.680> one<00:05:28.890> of<00:05:28.979> these<00:05:29.130> I

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
and since I do own each one of these I

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.610 
and since I do own each one of these I
can<00:05:29.460> absolutely<00:05:29.820> testify<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.870> fact<00:05:31.290> that

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
can absolutely testify the fact that

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.250 
can absolutely testify the fact that
even<00:05:31.860> in<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.490> know<00:05:32.640> she'll<00:05:32.910> perform<00:05:33.540> far

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
even in you know she'll perform far

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.070 
even in you know she'll perform far
better<00:05:34.890> than<00:05:35.160> these<00:05:35.370> two<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.820> that's<00:05:36.060> why<00:05:36.330> if

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
better than these two and that's why if

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.420 
better than these two and that's why if
I'm<00:05:37.260> doing<00:05:37.590> something<00:05:37.800> like<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.010> in<00:05:38.310> these

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
I'm doing something like that in these

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.969 
I'm doing something like that in these
jackets<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.180> have<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.080> pit<00:05:40.320> zips<00:05:40.590> open

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
jackets I have to have the pit zips open

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.420 
jackets I have to have the pit zips open
once<00:05:41.729> again<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.090> would<00:05:42.270> say<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:42.810> think

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
once again I would say that I think

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.159 
once again I would say that I think
advances<00:05:44.430> in<00:05:44.580> soft<00:05:44.850> shell<00:05:45.150> technology<00:05:45.510> are

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
advances in soft shell technology are

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.600 
advances in soft shell technology are
making<00:05:46.620> all<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.280> these<00:05:47.460> hard<00:05:47.850> shells<00:05:48.210> obsolete

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
making all of these hard shells obsolete

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.820 
making all of these hard shells obsolete
really<00:05:50.610> personally<00:05:51.270> for<00:05:51.479> me<00:05:51.690> but<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.620> only

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
really personally for me but the only

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.400 
really personally for me but the only
time<00:05:53.040> I'm<00:05:53.250> going<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.490> select<00:05:53.700> a<00:05:54.030> hard<00:05:54.330> shell<00:05:54.660> is

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
time I'm going to select a hard shell is
