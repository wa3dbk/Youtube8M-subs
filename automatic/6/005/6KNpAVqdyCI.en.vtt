quite<00:01:28.170> soft<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.340> really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
quite soft so what I do is I really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.539 
quite soft so what I do is I really
lightly<00:01:30.060> spray<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> hairspray

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
lightly spray it with a bit of hairspray

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
lightly spray it with a bit of hairspray
and<00:01:32.659> then<00:01:33.659> again<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> went<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.560> face<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and then again that went to my face and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
and then again that went to my face and
then<00:01:35.369> again<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> decides<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> graft<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
then again that decides the graft it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
then again that decides the graft it
just<00:01:36.990> makes<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.380> manageable<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
just makes it more manageable and the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.039 
just makes it more manageable and the
key<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> use<00:01:39.630> too<00:01:39.659> much<00:01:39.869> hairspray

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
key is not to use too much hairspray

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
key is not to use too much hairspray
will<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> actually<00:01:40.890> harder<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> work<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
will be actually harder to work with I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
will be actually harder to work with I
just<00:01:41.939> used<00:01:42.119> Bristow's<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.560> recommend<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just used Bristow's I don't recommend it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.370 
just used Bristow's I don't recommend it
it's<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.610> Harry<00:01:45.000> Bush

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it's not very good Harry Bush

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's not very good Harry Bush
so<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.270> to

so know what we do is we are going to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.929 
so know what we do is we are going to
split<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.290> ponytail<00:01:49.439> into<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.850> just

from John and bring it over to Mary know
the<00:02:22.640> whole<00:02:22.850> thing<00:02:23.000> about<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.600> um<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
the whole thing about this is um the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
the whole thing about this is um the
smaller<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:26.150> strands<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.570> hair<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
smaller the strands of hair that you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.050 
smaller the strands of hair that you
pick<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.770> more<00:02:27.920> intricate<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.670> plas<00:02:28.880> would

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pick the more intricate the plas would

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.060 
pick the more intricate the plas would
look<00:02:29.240> like<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.660> look<00:02:29.810> way<00:02:30.170> more<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.590> details

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
look like and look way more in details

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.790 
look like and look way more in details
and<00:02:31.630> looks<00:02:32.630> really<00:02:32.780> well<00:02:32.990> but<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.320> does<00:02:33.530> take<00:02:33.770> a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
and looks really well but it does take a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.610 
and looks really well but it does take a
whole<00:02:34.070> lot<00:02:34.220> longer<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.750> typically<00:02:36.350> go<00:02:36.590> for

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
whole lot longer so I typically go for

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.250 
whole lot longer so I typically go for
strands<00:02:37.420> try<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:38.600> two<00:02:38.720> strands<00:02:38.960> as<00:02:39.110> I'll

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
strands try and get two strands as I'll

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.320 
strands try and get two strands as I'll
to<00:02:39.350> be<00:02:39.440> about<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> same<00:02:39.860> size<00:02:39.920> each<00:02:40.370> time<00:02:40.640> but

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
to be about the same size each time but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.510 
to be about the same size each time but
that<00:02:41.660> size<00:02:41.960> is<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.800> for<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.070> do<00:02:43.220> have<00:02:43.490> a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
that size is when I go for I do have a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.980 
that size is when I go for I do have a
lot<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.820> hair<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.240> my<00:02:44.330> hair<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.600> quite<00:02:44.720> thick

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
lot of hair that my hair is quite thick

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.770 
lot of hair that my hair is quite thick
so<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:46.130> know<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.390> can<00:02:47.570> if<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
so you know but like if you can if you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420 
so you know but like if you can if you
have<00:02:47.900> finer<00:02:48.110> hair<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.530> would<00:02:48.770> actually<00:02:48.950> go<00:02:49.190> very

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
have finer hair I would actually go very

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.690 
have finer hair I would actually go very
smaller<00:02:49.820> ones<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.950> like<00:02:52.190> put<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.550> whole

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
smaller ones and like put the whole

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700 
smaller ones and like put the whole
thing<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:52.970> if<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.810> pick<00:02:54.050> kind<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.380> bigger<00:02:54.590> ones

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
thing is if you pick kind of bigger ones

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.410 
thing is if you pick kind of bigger ones
it<00:02:55.220> doesn't<00:02:55.460> actually<00:02:55.520> look<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.880> nice<00:02:56.210> it

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
it doesn't actually look that nice it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.120 
it doesn't actually look that nice it
can<00:02:56.510> looks<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:56.870> bit<00:02:57.080> sloppy<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.710> try

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
can looks a little bit sloppy and try

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.710 
can looks a little bit sloppy and try
and<00:02:58.250> keep<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.460> tight<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.060> whole<00:02:59.090> time<00:02:59.270> you're

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
and keep it tight the whole time you're

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.340 
and keep it tight the whole time you're
doing<00:03:00.020> that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
doing that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.930 
doing that
so<00:03:00.740> keep<00:03:00.950> comb<00:03:01.130> tightening<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.610> like<00:03:01.730> saying

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
so keep comb tightening it like saying

Canada or they enter the spectrum and

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.230 
Canada or they enter the spectrum and
make<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.680> look<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:15.980> a<00:06:16.040> more<00:06:16.160> formal<00:06:16.490> so<00:06:17.090> what<00:06:17.210> I

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
make it look in a more formal so what I

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.940 
make it look in a more formal so what I
would<00:06:17.450> do<00:06:17.570> in<00:06:17.690> that<00:06:17.720> case<00:06:17.870> is<00:06:18.230> I<00:06:18.560> would<00:06:18.740> maybe

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
would do in that case is I would maybe

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.100 
would do in that case is I would maybe
like<00:06:19.190> slicked<00:06:19.520> back<00:06:19.550> my<00:06:19.880> hair<00:06:20.120> clip<00:06:20.720> it<00:06:20.930> up<00:06:21.020> a

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
like slicked back my hair clip it up a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.570 
like slicked back my hair clip it up a
little<00:06:21.200> bit<00:06:21.380> so<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.680> back<00:06:21.860> home<00:06:22.100> is<00:06:22.280> quite<00:06:22.460> a

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
little bit so it back home is quite a

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.870 
little bit so it back home is quite a
bit<00:06:22.790> then<00:06:23.420> fit<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:23.900> plash<00:06:24.170> um<00:06:24.500> I<00:06:25.160> do<00:06:25.430> whenever

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
bit then fit the plash um I do whenever

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.490 
bit then fit the plash um I do whenever
I'd<00:06:26.210> be<00:06:26.330> doing<00:06:26.540> it<00:06:26.600> I'd<00:06:26.750> use<00:06:26.930> really<00:06:27.230> really

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
I'd be doing it I'd use really really

small pieces small strands of hair it

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.940 
small pieces small strands of hair it

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
would take ages but it would rewrite

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.890 
would take ages but it would rewrite
that<00:06:31.190> and<00:06:31.460> then<00:06:32.090> I<00:06:32.360> wouldn't<00:06:32.570> really<00:06:32.660> pull<00:06:32.870> a
