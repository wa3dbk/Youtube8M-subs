00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 hello friends week 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 not bad you started on tuesday today and 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.340
 finally published and the project reform 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.780
 reform draft legislation new 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.860
 immigration it is very big very 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.970
 serious document 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.070
 I can't say that I studied him 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.589
 I had time to study it I think 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:38.229
 it will take a lot of time and 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.999
 document this will change very much then 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:43.329
 I hope that they will accept it 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:45.609
 as he is now mostly but in 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.679
 the process of making a document there 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.170
 many different amendments begin 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.909
 additives and so on that is when 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.459
 document in general grin from and then 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.879
 starts voting amendments happens that 

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:58.959
 the meaning of the document changes dramatically and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.390
 spirit and letter 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:06.280
 even up to this why we 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 let's see how it goes now will be 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.550
 discussion but today it is clear that in 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.880
 we have a significant project 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.340
 visa facilitation worker that is there 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.590
 will increase someone and so on we still 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.870
 I do n’t know all the details 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 understand that what is now written is 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.750
 not something that will be taken necessarily 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 therefore as a direction only we can 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 look at it as such a general movement 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.380
 and we understand which way it is 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 moves but further this movement can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.090
 to be abruptly stopped 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.970
 on the contrary may be hard 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.030
 some new flows completely 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 it is obvious that however carefully these eight 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.159
 the man did not work on the bill 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 there are things that they do not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 have foreseen not thought of them now 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.399
 will correct on all sides and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 we have such a developed society 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.929
 your interest and all these groups with different 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.190
 interests will now be these interests in 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.959
 Toor some other way I say 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.150
 I want to say that it is not just eight 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.730
 man or is there even their helpers 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.370
 there are some of the posts did 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.500
 the bill they worked with the unions 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.019
 very closely because the unions are very 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 painful things like 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.970
 temporary visas for seasonal workers they 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.280
 afraid that seasonal workers will undermine 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.660
 the labor market is therefore the same union 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.190
 farm workers too 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 so they are looking to avoid 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.560
 too many scales of these temporary 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.900
 so that they don't undermine here and there 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.050
 union of entrepreneurs who are also 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.590
 look they look to them 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.810
 and with work visas from there all that 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.360
 business there is a startup here these 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.070
 visas which was legislation in 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.120
 principle, as it were, it was even accepted but 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.850
 he was not made 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.890
 separate law and just decided 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 integrate into the future this here 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.670
 legislation big serious 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 document a lot of time I will take you 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.190
 all urge but as you 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.370
 interested just don't bump 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.760
 strong speculation and not take strangers 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.410
 speculation for something that you too 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.000
 there it happened irina accomplished 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:32.150
 specifically with the lottery it is written there that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.720
 after david 2014 no more lotteries 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.360
 to do this in general 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.390
 it would be understandable I think what will happen 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.760
 some still debate on this subject that is 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.800
 maybe there they will talk and can 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.400
 be like something else we happen 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.250
 we understand that this is not well 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.350
 not completely we all understand it but 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.050
 as trends and also understand it and 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.430
 it used to be clear that somewhere they were there 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.010
 can pay this 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.129
 Visa see she can pass somewhere 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.560
 then in the amendments if somewhere will 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.379
 most of the people there who consider 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.590
 that it is not bad and we will see but 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.509
 as if at the level of the law, this is already clear 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:22.660
 I'm leaving for a couple of weeks and will be back rates 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:26.350
 May 1, I do n’t know how difficult it will be for me 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.660
 and it’s not difficult to keep track of it all there 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.430
 from another part of the planet 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.990
 I will be but I hope that we 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.060
 talk on this topic if not in 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.440
 the next two weeks right after 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.690
 when already some things in the debate will be 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.090
 can be honed and will be to something 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.570
 also converge all the kids happy 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.520
 clearly actually congratulate us all on 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.930
 so that we will have a good reform there 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.450
 there is no lottery but there is both remove 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.280
 there appeared things that could be 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.160
 previously were not very well written 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.170
 or made that is for merit there is 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.940
 such a thing that is people deserved 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.000
 who somehow distinguished themselves start them 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.860
 will give 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.780
 green card will be clothed migrations then 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.900
 there is usually a garden in detail to look but 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.970
 despite the fact that the lottery closes at 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.250
 everyone even if it really closes 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.210
 anyway there are opening some new 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.230
 ways so i think that in general in general 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.170
 and in general it is a step like this 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.750
 in good direction usa is a country 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.150
 immigrants are not here to 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.830
 someone wanted immigration overlap 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.090
 tagged somehow might be streamlined but 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.370
 you just need to sort 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.260
 really now in such a patchwork 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.260
 happy guys
