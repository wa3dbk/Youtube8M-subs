happens against cover 2 for some odd

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.639 
happens against cover 2 for some odd
reason<00:02:07.360> i<00:02:07.869> guessing<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:08.560> the

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
reason i guessing it's just the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.990 
reason i guessing it's just the
formation<00:02:09.160> or<00:02:09.280> something<00:02:09.580> i<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.759> no<00:02:09.880> idea

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
formation or something i have no idea

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.880 
formation or something i have no idea
why<00:02:10.269> this<00:02:10.330> happens<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.380> corner<00:02:11.739> just

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
why this happens but the corner just

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.970 
why this happens but the corner just
gets<00:02:12.070> sucked<00:02:12.459> inside<00:02:12.730> every<00:02:13.480> time<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.769> if<00:02:14.830> they

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
gets sucked inside every time so if they

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.530 
gets sucked inside every time so if they
ever<00:02:15.070> run<00:02:15.310> cover<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.700> look<00:02:15.880> at<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> corner<00:02:16.450> he

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
ever run cover to look at the corner he

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.030 
ever run cover to look at the corner he
just<00:02:16.690> gets<00:02:16.840> sucked<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.290> every<00:02:17.500> time<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
just gets sucked in every time and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.660 
just gets sucked in every time and
leaves<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.940> receiver<00:02:19.299> wide<00:02:20.019> open<00:02:20.769> this<00:02:21.489> also

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
leaves the receiver wide open this also

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.270 
leaves the receiver wide open this also
happens<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.180> other<00:02:22.360> zones<00:02:22.690> as<00:02:22.959> well<00:02:23.280> but

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
happens in other zones as well but

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
happens in other zones as well but
mainly<00:02:24.579> cover<00:02:25.000> 2<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.480> going<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.690> be<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> one

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
mainly cover 2 is going to be the one

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.080 
mainly cover 2 is going to be the one
that<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.709> does<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:27.610> just<00:02:27.700> look<00:02:27.910> at<00:02:28.030> how

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that it does that but just look at how

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.000 
that it does that but just look at how
wide<00:02:28.329> open<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.810> he's<00:02:29.350> going<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:29.829> first

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
wide open is he's going to be your first

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.289 
wide open is he's going to be your first
read<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> he's<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:31.030> open<00:02:31.269> about

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
read and he's going to be open about

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.940 
read and he's going to be open about
ninety<00:02:31.840> ninety-five<00:02:32.170> percent<00:02:32.470> at<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.769> time

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
ninety ninety-five percent at the time

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.770 
ninety ninety-five percent at the time
that's<00:02:33.160> why<00:02:33.340> he's<00:02:33.489> your<00:02:33.640> first<00:02:33.790> read<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.600> a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that's why he's your first read on a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.060 
that's why he's your first read on a
next<00:02:35.140> one's<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.440> be<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> tight<00:02:35.890> end

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
next one's going to be the tight end

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.199 
next one's going to be the tight end
right<00:02:36.220> here<00:02:36.400> you're<00:02:36.579> going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> want<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.000> try

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
right here you're going to want to try

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.690 
right here you're going to want to try
to<00:02:37.269> hit<00:02:37.480> them<00:02:37.540> quickly<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:39.070> because<00:02:39.489> it'll

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
to hit them quickly just because it'll

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.490 
to hit them quickly just because it'll
be<00:02:39.730> wide<00:02:40.030> open<00:02:40.060> real<00:02:40.570> quickly<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.380> then

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
be wide open real quickly and then

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.080 
be wide open real quickly and then
running<00:02:41.680> cover<00:02:41.980> three<00:02:42.280> or<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.549> cover<00:02:42.760> for

running cover three or like cover for
that's<00:02:43.329> when<00:02:43.510> he's<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.959> wide<00:02:44.200> open

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
that's when he's going to be wide open

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.520 
that's when he's going to be wide open
the<00:02:45.579> only<00:02:45.790> reason<00:02:46.510> why<00:02:46.660> he<00:02:46.690> would<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.140> covered

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the only reason why he would be covered

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.590 
the only reason why he would be covered
is<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.799> their<00:02:47.920> man<00:02:48.340> cover<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.820> cover<00:02:48.970> two<00:02:49.360> I'm

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
is that their man cover to cover two I'm

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.690 
is that their man cover to cover two I'm
so<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:50.560> they're<00:02:50.739> if<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.070> see<00:02:51.459> them<00:02:51.519> being

so if they're if you see them being

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.220 
so if they're if you see them being
covered<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.180> wait<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.630> be<00:02:52.690> patient<00:02:52.720> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
covered just wait and be patient and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.410 
covered just wait and be patient and
look<00:02:53.320> what<00:02:53.470> happens<00:02:53.799> against<00:02:54.130> cover<00:02:54.340> two<00:02:54.579> BAM

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
look what happens against cover two BAM

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.449 
look what happens against cover two BAM
he<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:55.900> gets<00:02:56.200> past<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.680> corner<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
he just gets past the corner the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
he just gets past the corner the
Safety's<00:02:57.910> get<00:02:58.090> pulled<00:02:58.329> back<00:02:58.420> by<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.959> post

Safety's get pulled back by that post

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410 
Safety's get pulled back by that post
route<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.680> look<00:02:59.829> at<00:02:59.980> how<00:03:00.130> easy<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.820> just

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
route and look at how easy it is just

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.350 
route and look at how easy it is just
easy<00:03:01.660> deep<00:03:02.170> touchdowns<00:03:02.769> all<00:03:03.040> day<00:03:03.310> long<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
easy deep touchdowns all day long and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360 
easy deep touchdowns all day long and
gets<00:03:04.600> covered<00:03:04.959> too<00:03:05.079> now<00:03:05.829> this<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.070> going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.280> be

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
gets covered too now this is going to be

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.160 
gets covered too now this is going to be
against<00:03:06.610> man<00:03:06.790> coverage<00:03:07.030> right<00:03:07.329> here<00:03:07.630> he's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
against man coverage right here he's

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
against man coverage right here he's
going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.380> be<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> glitchy<00:03:08.799> man<00:03:09.100> beater<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.579> look

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
going to be a glitchy man beater so look

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to be a glitchy man beater so look
at<00:03:09.850> how<00:03:10.060> much<00:03:10.269> separation<00:03:10.840> he<00:03:11.109> gets<00:03:12.930> just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
at how much separation he gets just

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.240 
at how much separation he gets just
because<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.320> guess<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.680> way<00:03:14.799> he<00:03:14.950> runs<00:03:15.160> his

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
because I guess the way he runs his

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.849 
because I guess the way he runs his
route<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.600> forces<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.109> computer<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.680> do

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
route it just forces the computer to do

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.039 
route it just forces the computer to do
something<00:03:18.220> weird<00:03:18.459> like<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.780> he's<00:03:19.900> just

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
something weird like that and he's just

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.530 
something weird like that and he's just
going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.260> burn<00:03:20.560> his<00:03:20.859> man<00:03:21.180> now<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.300> doesn't

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
going to burn his man now this doesn't

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.059 
going to burn his man now this doesn't
happen<00:03:22.720> every<00:03:23.170> single<00:03:23.200> time<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.860> going<00:03:23.980> to

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
happen every single time it's going to

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.500 
happen every single time it's going to
happen<00:03:24.190> about<00:03:24.370> eighty<00:03:24.700> percent<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.300> time

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
happen about eighty percent of the time

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.030 
happen about eighty percent of the time
I'm<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.410> zone

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
I'm the zone

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.490 
I'm the zone
beating<00:03:27.579> cover<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:28.090> anyways<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.840> cover<00:03:29.079> what

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
beating cover to anyways and cover what

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.899 
beating cover to anyways and cover what
Evers<00:03:29.769> will<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.069> open<00:03:30.430> every<00:03:30.489> single<00:03:30.790> time

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
Evers will be open every single time

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.300 
Evers will be open every single time
just<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.180> man<00:03:31.390> coverages<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.019> kind<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.010> iffy

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
just the man coverages is kind of iffy

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.619 
just the man coverages is kind of iffy
sometimes<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:33.909> about<00:03:34.030> eighty<00:03:34.450> to

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
sometimes it's about eighty to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.199 
sometimes it's about eighty to
eighty-five<00:03:34.930> percent<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:36.909> be<00:03:37.030> careful

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
eighty-five percent so just be careful

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.580 
eighty-five percent so just be careful
when<00:03:37.629> you're<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:38.019> you're<00:03:38.079> trying<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.349> throw

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
when you're when you're trying to throw

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.440 
when you're when you're trying to throw
this<00:03:38.739> route<00:03:38.980> but<00:03:39.790> look<00:03:39.969> at<00:03:40.060> what's<00:03:40.239> awesome

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
this route but look at what's awesome

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.300 
this route but look at what's awesome
about<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.810> formation<00:03:41.349> you're<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.159> to<00:03:42.219> be

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
about this formation you're going to be

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.580 
about this formation you're going to be
able<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.549> flip<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.030> formation<00:03:43.720> without<00:03:44.379> them

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
able to flip the formation without them

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.319 
able to flip the formation without them
even<00:03:44.709> knowing<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.340> flip<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.150> they're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
even knowing you flip it so if they're

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.940 
even knowing you flip it so if they're
trying<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.629> overload<00:03:46.989> one<00:03:47.349> side<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.739> just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
trying to overload one side you just

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
trying to overload one side you just
flip<00:03:48.189> it<00:03:48.220> real<00:03:48.519> quickly<00:03:48.790> they'll<00:03:49.420> have<00:03:49.569> no

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
flip it real quickly they'll have no

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.420 
flip it real quickly they'll have no
idea<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.439> then<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.650> run<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.980> play<00:03:51.189> to<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
idea and then you run the play to the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.099 
idea and then you run the play to the
other<00:03:51.579> side<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.879> look<00:03:52.030> how<00:03:52.180> easy<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.689> is<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
other side and look how easy it is and

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.559 
other side and look how easy it is and
all<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.099> flip<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.700> now<00:03:55.090> i<00:03:55.120> do<00:03:55.269> recommend

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
all you do is flip it now i do recommend

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.170 
all you do is flip it now i do recommend
flipping<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.409> because<00:03:57.010> there<00:03:57.219> is<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.430> very<00:03:57.969> i've

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
flipping it because there is a very i've

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.729 
flipping it because there is a very i've
noticed<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.689> higher<00:03:58.900> percentage<00:03:59.139> rate<00:03:59.590> when

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
noticed a higher percentage rate when

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.080 
noticed a higher percentage rate when
going<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.129> receiver<00:04:00.519> just<00:04:00.849> because<00:04:01.060> I

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
going to the receiver just because I

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.339 
going to the receiver just because I
guess<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.420> receivers<00:04:01.780> faster<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.260> has

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
guess the receivers faster and has

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.039 
guess the receivers faster and has
better<00:04:02.590> route<00:04:02.829> running<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:04.450> he<00:04:04.599> does<00:04:04.840> get

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
better route running but he does get

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.899 
better route running but he does get
open<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.439> lot<00:04:05.709> easier<00:04:05.919> against<00:04:06.340> man<00:04:06.609> rather

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
open a lot easier against man rather

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.099 
open a lot easier against man rather
than<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.269> tight<00:04:07.480> end<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:07.780> if<00:04:07.840> you're<00:04:07.989> having

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
than the tight end so if you're having

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.710 
than the tight end so if you're having
trouble<00:04:08.230> flip<00:04:09.099> it<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.280> go<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.579> him<00:04:09.849> now<00:04:10.659> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720
