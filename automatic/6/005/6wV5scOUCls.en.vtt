00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.650
 voice is not much regret to have 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.760
 except except maybe have to mark 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.570
 during your prime time in first 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 period 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.760
 oh yes when we have no organ at all 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.470
 fought well and staged successful 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.060
 reaction we still had two 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.430
 points 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.440
 a post and mark it's you 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.150
 something you are nice mid and 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.750
 how did you approach the first 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.750
 minutes of the match 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.380
 we did not expect if there will be 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.040
 we are all very impressed hyper 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.740
 stressed because it's the first time 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.060
 for us something like this 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.760
 why ours 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.460
 to play after we thought we were going 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.990
 to play our football and that would not 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.580
 not good new ad father 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.360
 necessarily their job and I 'm going 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.820
 cup of france 1 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.990
 we 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.670
 I'm going back just two seconds on 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 the public it's true that I do not know if 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 you have played often in front of more than 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.780
 2000 people 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.030
 so honestly for us this is the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.790
 first time we still tried to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.840
 to make my margin of progress that's it 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.840
 that we were imminent in the region 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.370
 even if I come out of a rough match 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.840
 international 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.510
 I was still happy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.190
 participate in this match because what he 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.780
 are some pitfalls to avoid in this kind of 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.790
 match we say that I think about the tripod 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.620
 that's what happened you won 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.760
 the race open and stronger because 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.320
 that precisely there are pitfalls to avoid 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.720
 in the match of course the trap this match 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.570
 lightly ie higher and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 that it's going to be easy and I think 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.450
 it's a little bit past 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.430
 Sadly 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.329
 life in the physical impact we lost 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.329
 far too much to handle 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.700
 successful about this but I think that does not 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.700
 not see beaches 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:22.500
 like 6-0 does it satisfy you inhabitants 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.040
 think that this match allowed us to 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.760
 see that so-called easy matches 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.950
 serious match and my duels that nerves 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.410
 in all and especially the opportunities because 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.650
 that I think that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.360
 opportunities and 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.360
 thing of tighter
