00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
broken so we got another one just like

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.380 
broken so we got another one just like
that<00:01:35.090> part<00:01:35.719> and<00:01:36.250> put<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.609> bone<00:01:37.789> but

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
going to be working this this spell

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.719 
going to be working this this spell
requires<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:01.189> lot<00:02:01.579> more<00:02:02.079> voltage<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:03.950> this
