the Earth's natural resources take me
for<00:00:21.420> instance<00:00:21.449> I'm<00:00:21.990> made<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.470> recycled

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
for instance I'm made of recycled

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.660 
for instance I'm made of recycled
aluminum

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
aluminum

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359

I've<00:00:23.880> been<00:00:24.180> recycled<00:00:24.570> old<00:00:24.980> hundreds<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.130> times

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I've been recycled old hundreds of times

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
I've been recycled old hundreds of times
and<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.210> always<00:00:27.449> come<00:00:27.810> back<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.260> good<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.590> new

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
products that can be recycled they

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
products that can be recycled they
usually<00:00:52.050> place<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> bin<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.430> container

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
usually place them in a bin or container

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
usually place them in a bin or container
depending<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.660> where<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:54.989> live<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
depending on where they live as you can

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
depending on where they live as you can
see<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.210> wheeled<00:00:57.449> containers<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.170> really

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
see the wheeled containers are really

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.410 
see the wheeled containers are really
useful<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.789> hold<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.120> lot<00:01:00.149> more

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
useful because they hold a lot more

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
useful because they hold a lot more
recyclable<00:01:01.289> materials<00:01:01.859> than<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
recyclable materials than the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
recyclable materials than the
traditional<00:01:02.640> bins<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.600> require<00:01:03.960> fewer

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
traditional bins and they require fewer

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.670 
traditional bins and they require fewer
pickups<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> recycling<00:01:05.850> trucks<00:01:06.680> recycled

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
pickups by the recycling trucks recycled

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
pickups by the recycling trucks recycled
materials<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.310> collected<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.000> variety

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
materials can be collected in a variety

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
materials can be collected in a variety
of<00:01:09.689> ways<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> newest<00:01:11.340> ways<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
of ways one of the newest ways is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
of ways one of the newest ways is
through<00:01:11.970> automated<00:01:12.630> collection<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.740> means

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
through automated collection this means

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
through automated collection this means
that<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> truck<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> robotic<00:01:15.479> arm<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
that the truck has a robotic arm that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
that the truck has a robotic arm that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the street isn't that easy the trucks

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
the street isn't that easy the trucks

that collect these recycled materials

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
that collect these recycled materials
take<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> waste<00:01:26.220> management<00:01:26.580> material

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
