important to be flexible and have the
capability<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> adapt<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
capability to adapt but you need to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.969 
capability to adapt but you need to

in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> game

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
in the game

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.220 
in the game
number<00:02:09.890> four<00:02:10.209> play<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.689> side<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:11.989> the

you get is the side you're going to have
for<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.629> entire<00:02:18.230> game<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.340> you're<00:02:19.489> inside

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
for that entire game so if you're inside

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.080 
for that entire game so if you're inside
or<00:02:20.510> outside<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:21.739> strategies<00:02:22.400> will<00:02:22.700> need<00:02:22.909> to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
or outside your strategies will need to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.360 
or outside your strategies will need to
change<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.079> let<00:02:24.230> me<00:02:24.319> give<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.560> an<00:02:24.650> example<00:02:24.769> we

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
change so let me give you an example we

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.240 
change so let me give you an example we
spawn<00:02:25.730> outside<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.049> a<00:02:27.079> few<00:02:27.170> options<00:02:27.560> we

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
spawn outside we have a few options we

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.129 
spawn outside we have a few options we
can<00:02:28.430> rush<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.939> see<00:02:29.209> which<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.659> going<00:02:29.959> directly

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:30.139 
can rush to see which is going directly

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.259 
can rush to see which is going directly
right<00:02:30.709> off<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.129> spawn<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.609> really<00:02:31.849> push<00:02:32.060> them

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
right off the spawn and really push them

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.390 
right off the spawn and really push them

aggressively over their heavy ammo we

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.979 
aggressively over their heavy ammo we
can<00:02:34.549> rush<00:02:34.760> through<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.299> middle<00:02:35.599> if<00:02:35.689> we<00:02:35.810> want

can rush through the middle if we want

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.229 
can rush through the middle if we want
to<00:02:36.049> catch<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.530> off<00:02:36.680> during<00:02:37.010> top<00:02:37.250> mid<00:02:37.549> or<00:02:38.060> we

you're playing if you're on the inside
of<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.250> map<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.639> will<00:02:49.819> change<00:02:50.120> your

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
of the map it will change your

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.420 
of the map it will change your
strategies<00:02:50.900> as<00:02:51.109> well<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:52.069> comes<00:02:52.280> from

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
strategies as well this comes from

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.039 
strategies as well this comes from
experience<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:53.180> knowing<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.480> map<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.989> of

experience and knowing the map and of
course<00:02:54.290> since<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> maps<00:02:54.829> are<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.129> to

course since the maps are going to
change<00:02:55.430> each<00:02:55.639> week<00:02:55.909> it's<00:02:56.359> important<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.079> you

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
change each week it's important that you

going to sit on your side of the map and

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.069 
going to sit on your side of the map and
try<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.459> take<00:03:31.609> your<00:03:31.970> heavy<00:03:32.299> but<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.930> also

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
try and take your heavy but you also

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.689 
try and take your heavy but you also
need<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.379> be<00:03:33.470> aware<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.949> other<00:03:34.069> team<00:03:34.310> might<00:03:34.519> be

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
trying to do the same thing I had a few

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.020 
trying to do the same thing I had a few
games<00:03:36.349> where<00:03:36.560> we<00:03:36.859> each<00:03:37.069> rushed<00:03:37.430> each<00:03:37.639> other's

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
games where we each rushed each other's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.689 
games where we each rushed each other's
heavy<00:03:38.299> ammos<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.930> missed<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.799> team<00:03:40.009> entirely

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
heavy ammos and missed the team entirely

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.969 
heavy ammos and missed the team entirely
so<00:03:40.939> we<00:03:41.299> just<00:03:41.449> ended<00:03:41.659> up<00:03:41.750> taking<00:03:41.989> one<00:03:42.620> another's

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
so we just ended up taking one another's

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.259 
so we just ended up taking one another's
heavies<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.340> fighting<00:03:43.759> again<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.180> middle
