00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:35.120
 and then jokes in this new video 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.890
 prepaid has heard a sound of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.219
 background but mine amazed because 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.210
 feet frozen and therefore there is a hold 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.519
 by hand company then I want today 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 propose this make up for san 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.790
 valentino but always if I make it to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.670
 upload the video for Valentine's Day 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.780
 because it puts this video if me 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.670
 immediately interested that I am not 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.619
 recording the 13th night on the 13th evening e 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.809
 this night dedicated to editing e 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.630
 I hope that in short by tomorrow it is 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.470
 online 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:13.640
 then there is a premise to be made that yes 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.930
 it looks like the classic brownish look 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.000
 from natural tones 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:25.670
 but let's face it a little different and there is 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.979
 to say that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.350
 but I had made the resistance speech 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.640
 it must be said that for valentine's of 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.840
 they are usually always made up too 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.020
 on man it was things 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.270
 also this year I can take from a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.039
 they draw for the horns and a very thing 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.480
 seductive captivating and therefore I have 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.870
 wanted to do 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.730
 a look to seduce a man like that then 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.100
 I also did this a little cat and 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.920
 becoming a bit the style of megan fox e 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.290
 however this bothers 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.690
 in most cases the league that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.640
 he gave us this pencil shade 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.460
 Black 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.590
 and then wanted to make red lips because 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.590
 I think the red lips are really 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.510
 how to say red lipstick is a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.000
 accessory that makes the woman according to me 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.740
 even more seductive 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.880
 so I could put on lipstick 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.360
 red 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.480
 and what to say and then all is enough 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 obviously not easy to recreate 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.220
 but I have the added counselor 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.250
 the red one for the lips 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.200
 obviously if you have to kiss someone it is 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.260
 more recommended by the lip tint grandmothers 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.040
 so that you go there to do one 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.670
 elbow you will find me with all the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.590
 respect shed for the face and that's it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.110
 I hope I like this look e 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 does not know teverina given in my happy 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.840
 luca or written by real and now 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.000
 they are a very dark, almost dark brown 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.210
 20 change e 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.890
 more elongated hair miraculously 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.890
 or just a potion came 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:26.080
 It is necessary that this square look 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.920
 to a good valentine to all and also 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.920
 towards the sea 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.920
 let's start spreading the primer over the whole 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 fixed and outside mobile eyelid 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 of the lower rhyme and subsequently 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.560
 I blur with my finger 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.600
 I apply a black pencil to the attachment 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.340
 upper lashes and pull towards 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.650
 the outside 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.420
 now with a schemino and I will use this 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.790
 from a pencil I go to blend the pencil 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.350
 so very bland and then 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.380
 later on apply a 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.420
 very clear eyeshadow the best in the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.740
 eye fold I apply a light brown 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.080
 tending to orange and then 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:08.410
 subsequently with other eye shadows I go 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.840
 to darken with a brush bristle 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.060
 squares I'm going to blend a black eye shadow 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.930
 at the lash and anti- hairline 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.400
 in the outer corner of the eye for 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.350
 blend the black in the best way 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.670
 can help me with a very brown 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.040
 dark and now I apply a brown 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.870
 slightly orange on the outside of the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.120
 lower rhyme than later 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.120
 I will go to intensify with some black 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.470
 and now I'm going to create the light points in the 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:43.280
 internal gorge and on the height of the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.539
 eyebrows I apply a color pencil 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.849
 meat in the inner rim of the eye e 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.129
 then later I apply the mascara 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.750
 on upper and lower lashes ed 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.520
 obviously if you want you can apply 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.520
 also some beautiful false eyelashes 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.810
 and now let's move on to make-up of the face 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.810
 start by spreading a primer 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:19.509
 subsequently with a green corrector 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.830
 goes to cover my blushes and now 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.830
 I apply a compact foundation 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.240
 I'm going to cover the discoloration of mine 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.340
 dark circles with a slightly concealer 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.230
 orange and then I go to 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.920
 create light points with a concealer 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:54.180
 this time of a yellowish color 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:54.180
 Cream leather color throughout with a powder 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.860
 does not appear a slight contouring with one 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.430
 dust a little darker than mine 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.430
 incarnate 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.300
 I apply a catch and opaque blush and now 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.460
 after being surrounded, the 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.560
 our lips with a red pencil vat 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.259
 the vat goes to dab with a powder in 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.870
 so that our look lasts longer 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.069
 for the lips and then later 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.990
 passing a red lipstick of the 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.430
 same shade 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.020
 our look for Valentine's Day has 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.000
 finished i hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.990
