00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
record-breaking game last Monday night

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
record-breaking game last Monday night
that<00:01:22.200> game<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.799> ridiculous<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.640> mean

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that game was just ridiculous I mean

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
that game was just ridiculous I mean
obviously<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.720> expect<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.290> repeat<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
obviously don't expect a repeat of that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.859 
obviously don't expect a repeat of that
but<00:01:26.670> he<00:01:26.729> does<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> decent<00:01:27.330> matchup

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
but he does have a decent matchup

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
but he does have a decent matchup
against<00:01:28.140> Houston<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> understand<00:01:29.189> why

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
against Houston so I understand why

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
against Houston so I understand why
you're<00:01:29.579> questioning<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.509> Matt<00:01:30.689> Ryan's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you're questioning this but Matt Ryan's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're questioning this but Matt Ryan's
at<00:01:31.259> home<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> slightly<00:01:32.850> tougher

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
at home I know it's a slightly tougher

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
at home I know it's a slightly tougher
matchup<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.409> he's<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> slight

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
matchup I just think he's a slight

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
matchup I just think he's a slight
through<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> safer<00:01:35.520> play<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.150> has<00:01:36.270> more

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
through the safer play here he has more

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.749 
through the safer play here he has more
weapons<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.110> henny<00:01:37.530> does<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.640> an

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
weapons than henny does it's just an

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
weapons than henny does it's just an
overall<00:01:39.030> better<00:01:39.329> offense<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> stick

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
overall better offense I think you stick

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.920 
overall better offense I think you stick
with<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.369> Matt<00:01:41.729> Ryan<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.180> home<00:01:42.360> although<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> do

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with the Matt Ryan at home although I do

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630
