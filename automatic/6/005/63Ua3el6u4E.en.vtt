just twist and rip and but I prefer the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
just twist and rip and but I prefer the
look<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.729> back<00:01:09.000> home<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.659> most<00:01:09.960> listeners

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
look of back home just most listeners

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.310 
look of back home just most listeners
looks<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> braid<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:13.170> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
looks kind of like a braid and I want my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.190 
looks kind of like a braid and I want my
hair<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.890> dreads<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.970> braids<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
hair to look like dreads not braids but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.399 
hair to look like dreads not braids but
um<00:01:16.409> although<00:01:17.220> apparently<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.479> twisting<00:01:19.259> trip

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
um although apparently the twisting trip

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
um although apparently the twisting trip
is<00:01:19.619> better<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.189> hair<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.240> back

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is better for your hair because the back

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
is better for your hair because the back
home<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.990> undo<00:01:22.380> itself<00:01:22.939> but<00:01:23.939> uh<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.420> decided<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
home can undo itself but uh I decided to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.710 
home can undo itself but uh I decided to
go<00:01:25.080> natural<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.680> rest<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> way<00:01:26.600> because<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
go natural the rest of the way because I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.590 
go natural the rest of the way because I
wanted<00:01:28.049> my<00:01:28.200> hair<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.619> grow<00:01:29.210> perko<00:01:30.210> reason

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
wanted my hair to grow perko reason

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.420 
wanted my hair to grow perko reason
because<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> want<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> let<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.009> hair<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> grow

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because I want to let my hair to grow

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.660 
because I want to let my hair to grow
while<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.119> dreaded<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> amount<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
while it dreaded so that the amount that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.069 
while it dreaded so that the amount that
it<00:01:35.850> shrunk<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> less<00:01:36.780> noticeable

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it shrunk would be less noticeable

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
it shrunk would be less noticeable
because<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.939> hair<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> long

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
because I really like my hair to be long

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.700 
because I really like my hair to be long
and<00:01:39.990> um<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.659> second<00:01:42.960> reason<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.290> just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and um and the second reason was just

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.370 
and um and the second reason was just
because<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.180> pride<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.840> growing<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
because I take more pride and growing it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.910 
because I take more pride and growing it
myself<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.659> being<00:01:48.990> able<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.290> save<00:01:49.470> my

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
myself and I like being able to save my

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.350 
myself and I like being able to save my
hair

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
I did this itself and that I you undo it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.120 
I did this itself and that I you undo it
I<00:01:52.610> mean<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:52.880> did<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.240> some<00:01:53.450> but<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.290> know<00:01:54.410> the
