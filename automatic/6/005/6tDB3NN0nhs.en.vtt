00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
converting it to digital text now here

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
converting it to digital text now here
is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> cool<00:00:24.449> function<00:00:24.840> i<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.859> write<00:00:26.039> down<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is a cool function i can write down a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
is a cool function i can write down a
formula<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.029> easily<00:00:27.869> find<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.289> answer<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
formula and easily find an answer to it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
formula and easily find an answer to it
you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.390> i'm<00:00:30.720> writing<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.109> down

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
you can see that as i'm writing it down

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.250 
you can see that as i'm writing it down
but<00:00:31.800> formula<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> recognized<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.010 

now<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.530> meant<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> write<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> 6<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.629> my

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now i meant to write down a 6 but my

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
now i meant to write down a 6 but my
handwriting<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.010> great<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.850> i'll

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
handwriting is not so great so i'll

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
handwriting is not so great so i'll
simply<00:00:42.600> erase<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.350> correct<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.340> like

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
simply erase it and correct it just like

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
simply erase it and correct it just like
this<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.480> easy<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> i'll<00:00:46.770> write

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this so as easy as that and i'll write

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.900 
this so as easy as that and i'll write
down<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> better<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:49.190> now<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> formulas<00:00:50.760> been

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
down a better one now the formulas been

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
down a better one now the formulas been
recognized<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.629> let's<00:00:52.020> find<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> answer

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
recognized so let's find the answer

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
recognized so let's find the answer
which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> show<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.140> side

which is going to show up on this side
of<00:00:55.530> screen<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:57.449> answer<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.750> 88<00:00:58.289> over<00:00:58.590> 3<00:00:58.890> plus<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
of screen the answer is 88 over 3 plus I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
of screen the answer is 88 over 3 plus I
can<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> diagram<00:01:01.559> here
