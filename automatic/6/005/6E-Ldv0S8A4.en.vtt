00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.479
 already 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.100
 it's good to practice those slowly now 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.100
 it's clear but something like that is enough 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.419
 i 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.400
 very well another option that they have is to touch 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.400
 to re 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.580
 if less 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.890
