 what we talk about when we say chocolate 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.490
 organic organic chocolate comes from 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.710
 an ancestor that is organic cocoa 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.350
 organic cocoa is not going to have any 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.000
 fertilizer in its production in the in 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.520
 the harvest is not going to have any 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.350
 agrochemical that helps its production or 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.160
 that controls some disease or some 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.480
 plague why we are developing the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.580
 organic chocolate with made with 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530
 cocoa our organic de tabasco 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.470
 good what we are doing 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.080
 it is a vertical use of the field 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.180
 from there for example instead of 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.760
 the weapon near the cocoa is wasted and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.440
 they have in the same ear 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.090
 we take advantage of the endo candles and I imagine 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 that smells like chocolate but good 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.300
 Roma colony but varies from location one 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.490
