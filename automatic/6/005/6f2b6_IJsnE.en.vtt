00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
strictly a bit better than the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.999 
strictly a bit better than the
competition<00:01:55.569> well<00:01:56.410> there's<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.679> number<00:01:56.860> of

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
competition well there's a number of

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.859 
competition well there's a number of
things<00:01:57.250> innovation<00:01:58.209> in<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.390> product<00:01:58.780> is

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
things innovation in the product is

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.050 
things innovation in the product is
really<00:01:59.050> pretty<00:01:59.380> key<00:01:59.590> for<00:01:59.800> us<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.459> four<00:02:00.819> six

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
really pretty key for us the four six

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.300 
really pretty key for us the four six
cylinder<00:02:01.360> heads<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.599> great<00:02:01.780> example<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.310> we

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
cylinder heads a great example that we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.800 
cylinder heads a great example that we
started<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.789> project<00:02:04.060> looking<00:02:04.599> at<00:02:04.690> the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
started that project looking at the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.809 
started that project looking at the
factory<00:02:05.229> head<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.679> what<00:02:06.160> could<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.340> do<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.759> the

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
factory head and what could we do in the

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.419 
factory head and what could we do in the
same<00:02:07.000> packaging<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.630> factory<00:02:07.989> head<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
same packaging the factory head is and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.040 
same packaging the factory head is and
basically<00:02:09.880> there's<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.239> lot<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.509> cnc<00:02:10.869> ported

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
basically there's a lot of cnc ported

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.690 
basically there's a lot of cnc ported
heads<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.650> market<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.099> if<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.340> stay<00:02:12.550> with

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
heads on the market and if you stay with

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.160 
heads on the market and if you stay with
the<00:02:12.790> factory<00:02:13.150> valve<00:02:13.390> geometry<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.050> only

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the factory valve geometry there's only

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.530 
the factory valve geometry there's only
so<00:02:14.410> much<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:15.069> we<00:02:15.730> took<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.150> factory

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
so much you can do we took that factory

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.180 
so much you can do we took that factory
geometry<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.290> flipped<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.650> intake<00:02:17.980> valve

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
geometry and we flipped the intake valve

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
geometry and we flipped the intake valve
to<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.489> other<00:02:18.700> side<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> camshaft

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
to the other side of the camshaft

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.990 
to the other side of the camshaft
gave<00:02:20.440> us<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.680> lot<00:02:20.860> better<00:02:21.069> flow<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.400> intake<00:02:21.670> port

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
gave us a lot better flow in intake port

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.729 
gave us a lot better flow in intake port
gave<00:02:22.239> us<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.480> lot<00:02:22.660> more<00:02:22.810> piston<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.319> valve<00:02:23.349> than

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
gave us a lot more piston to valve than

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.500 
gave us a lot more piston to valve than
the<00:02:23.800> factory<00:02:24.160> head<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:25.000> an<00:02:25.120> excellent

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the factory head and it's an excellent

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.390 
the factory head and it's an excellent
performing<00:02:26.140> head<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.500> head<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.860> as<00:02:27.069> cast

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
performing head that head with as cast

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.640 
performing head that head with as cast
ports<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.060> cnc<00:02:28.480> chamber<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:28.989> bowl<00:02:29.110> blend

ports and a cnc chamber and bowl blend

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.770 
ports and a cnc chamber and bowl blend
makes<00:02:29.980> 15<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.430> 20<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.880> horsepower<00:02:31.360> than<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
makes 15 to 20 more horsepower than the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
makes 15 to 20 more horsepower than the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
best cnc ported factory head that's out

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.000 
best cnc ported factory head that's out
there<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.450> over<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.350> years<00:02:35.560> we've<00:02:35.770> really

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
there so over the years we've really

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.530 
there so over the years we've really
been<00:02:36.250> known<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.610> innovation<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.180> twisted

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
been known for innovation the twisted

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.330 
been known for innovation the twisted
wedge<00:02:37.690> head<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.140> for<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.710> 5<00:02:38.860> liter<00:02:39.010> Ford

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340

as<00:02:48.880> well<00:02:49.230> our<00:02:50.230> LT<00:02:50.590> 1<00:02:50.830> head<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> good<00:02:51.370> example

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
as well our LT 1 head is a good example

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.180 
as well our LT 1 head is a good example
of<00:02:51.850> another<00:02:52.060> product<00:02:52.390> for<00:02:52.630> 2009<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.890> wanted<00:02:54.130> to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
of another product for 2009 we wanted to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.130 
of another product for 2009 we wanted to
make<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> small<00:02:54.730> chamber<00:02:54.970> version<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> LT<00:02:55.900> 1

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
make a small chamber version of the LT 1

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
make a small chamber version of the LT 1
head<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.950> only<00:02:57.160> way<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.520> could<00:02:57.640> do<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.820> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
head the only way we could do that and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.670 
head the only way we could do that and
get<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.270> airflow<00:02:58.630> targets<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.290> had<00:02:59.470> was

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
get the airflow targets that we had was

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.560 
get the airflow targets that we had was
the<00:02:59.830> roll<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> valve<00:03:00.340> angle<00:03:00.520> 2<00:03:00.850> degrees<00:03:01.180> so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the roll the valve angle 2 degrees so

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.140 
the roll the valve angle 2 degrees so
again<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.020> change<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.410> valve<00:03:02.620> geometry<00:03:03.280> got<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
again we change the valve geometry got a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.670 
again we change the valve geometry got a
really<00:03:04.450> good<00:03:04.630> intake<00:03:04.960> port<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.470> head

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
really good intake port out of the head

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.730 
really good intake port out of the head
it's<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.520> very<00:03:07.090> nice<00:03:07.420> design<00:03:07.990> head<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.620> that

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
it's a very nice design head and that

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.440 
it's a very nice design head and that
it's<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.100> small<00:03:09.430> intake<00:03:09.820> port<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.270> only

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it's got a small intake port it's only

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.840 
it's got a small intake port it's only
