because to me into sporting as a part of
our<00:01:55.240> philosophy<00:01:56.220> more<00:01:57.220> important<00:01:57.910> than<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
our philosophy more important than to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.420 
our philosophy more important than to
win<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.700> make<00:02:01.510> sure<00:02:01.540> that<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.050> players

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
win is to make sure that the players

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.550 
win is to make sure that the players
play<00:02:03.430> every<00:02:03.970> minute<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.930> win<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.200> matches

play every minute to win the matches
okay<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:07.180> if<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.020> result<00:02:08.320> was<00:02:08.440> 104<00:02:09.399> less<00:02:09.580> our

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
okay so if the result was 104 less our

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.990 
okay so if the result was 104 less our
soda<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.570> satisfied<00:02:11.140> anyway<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:12.700> could<00:02:12.880> have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
soda be satisfied anyway we could have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.480 
soda be satisfied anyway we could have
won<00:02:13.270> 4-1<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.410> could<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.800> disappointed<00:02:15.430> with

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
won 4-1 and I could be disappointed with

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.210 
won 4-1 and I could be disappointed with
the<00:02:15.610> players<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.870> not<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.080> case<00:02:17.410> because

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the players that is not the case because

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.560 
the players that is not the case because
what<00:02:18.520> I've<00:02:18.640> seen<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.300> players

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
what I've seen is that the players

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.920 
what I've seen is that the players
always<00:02:20.440> try<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.720> best<00:02:22.870> ones<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.890> be

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
always try to be the best ones in to be

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.110 
always try to be the best ones in to be
best<00:02:25.930> players<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.590> every<00:02:26.980> time<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.340> play<00:02:27.490> okay

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
best players in every time we play okay

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.880 
best players in every time we play okay
that<00:02:28.660> for<00:02:28.870> us<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.170> most<00:02:29.350> important

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
that for us is the most important

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.030 
that for us is the most important
because<00:02:30.960> sporting<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.050> too<00:02:32.230> focused<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.800> their

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
because sporting is too focused on their

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
because sporting is too focused on their
players<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:34.510> than<00:02:34.780> their<00:02:35.020> teams<00:02:35.340> okay<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.360> I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
players more than their teams okay so I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.900 
players more than their teams okay so I
believe<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.740> result<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> very

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
believe that this result it is a very

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.949 
believe that this result it is a very
good<00:02:40.390> result<00:02:40.540> against<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.850> world<00:02:42.850> known<00:02:43.030> team

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
good result against the world known team

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.710 
good result against the world known team
like<00:02:44.350> Manchester<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.640> play<00:02:45.850> very<00:02:46.120> well<00:02:46.209> they

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
like Manchester that play very well they

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.870 
like Manchester that play very well they
experience<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> same<00:02:47.740> difficulties<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.550> we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
experience the same difficulties as we

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.900 
experience the same difficulties as we
did<00:02:49.060> regarding<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:49.990> weather<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.610> i<00:02:51.700> think

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
did regarding the weather but i think

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.229 
did regarding the weather but i think
that<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> result<00:02:52.510> reflects<00:02:53.220> our<00:02:54.239> philosophy

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
that the result reflects our philosophy

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.050 
that the result reflects our philosophy
and<00:02:55.480> our<00:02:55.690> way<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> work<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.410> then<00:02:57.280> i<00:02:57.760> believe

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and our way to work and then i believe

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.960 
and our way to work and then i believe
that<00:02:58.209> winning<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.070> consequence<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.280> what

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
that winning is a consequence of what

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.150 
that winning is a consequence of what
we're<00:03:01.209> doing<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.900> spotting<00:03:02.230> academy<00:03:02.650> well<00:03:03.130> i
