00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
what it looks like it's a nice looking

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.010 
what it looks like it's a nice looking
guitar<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:10.100> would<00:01:10.220> think<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.660> would<00:01:11.660> be<00:01:11.690> heavy

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
guitar you would think it would be heavy

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.350 
guitar you would think it would be heavy
but<00:01:12.440> if<00:01:13.010> that's<00:01:13.160> not<00:01:13.400> really<00:01:13.790> like<00:01:14.000> there<00:01:14.210> must

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
but if that's not really like there must

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.090 
but if that's not really like there must
be<00:01:14.510> some<00:01:15.080> kind<00:01:15.230> of<00:01:16.120> chamber<00:01:17.120> inside<00:01:17.690> if<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.710> if<00:01:19.010> I

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
be some kind of chamber inside if I if I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.470 
be some kind of chamber inside if I if I
read<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> literature<00:01:19.610> I'd<00:01:19.940> know<00:01:20.150> it's

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
read the literature I'd know it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.450 
read the literature I'd know it's
probably<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> chamber<00:01:21.170> inside<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.800> it's<00:01:22.280> but

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
probably a chamber inside and it's but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.090 
probably a chamber inside and it's but
it's<00:01:22.790> really<00:01:22.970> close<00:01:23.180> got<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.830> what<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:24.890> like

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
it's really close got this what I like

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.080 
it's really close got this what I like
about<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:26.270> got<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:26.720> volume<00:01:27.200> control<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
about it it's got one volume control and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.149 
about it it's got one volume control and
one<00:01:29.090> tone<00:01:29.330> control<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.500> can<00:01:30.620> kind<00:01:30.950> of<00:01:31.010> do

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
one tone control so you can kind of do

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.860 
one tone control so you can kind of do
stuff<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.580> then<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.940> volume<00:01:32.210> controls<00:01:32.479> handy

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.450 

so<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:38.990> volume<00:01:39.230> control<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.650> real<00:01:39.830> handy<00:01:40.040> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
so the volume control is real handy it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.250 
so the volume control is real handy it
only<00:01:40.610> has<00:01:40.760> one<00:01:40.790> volume<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.420> one<00:01:41.540> tone<00:01:41.840> control

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
only has one volume in one tone control

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.790 
only has one volume in one tone control
which<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.340> pretty<00:01:43.520> cool<00:01:43.730> because<00:01:44.110> my<00:01:45.110> Les<00:01:45.560> Paul

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
which is pretty cool because my Les Paul

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.230 
which is pretty cool because my Les Paul
there's<00:01:46.160> actually<00:01:46.490> two<00:01:46.640> volumes<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.120> two

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
there's actually two volumes and two

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.270 
there's actually two volumes and two
tone<00:01:47.600> controls<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.380> always<00:01:48.530> confuses<00:01:49.130> me

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
tone controls and it always confuses me

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.940 
tone controls and it always confuses me
so<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:50.300> actually<00:01:50.480> took<00:01:50.720> me<00:01:50.900> years<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.170> get<00:01:51.380> use

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so it actually took me years to get use

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.430 
so it actually took me years to get use
of<00:01:52.160> them<00:01:52.280> used<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.850> them<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.180> if<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.260> buy<00:01:54.380> this

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
of them used to them and if you buy this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.740 
of them used to them and if you buy this
guitar<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.950> don't<00:01:55.100> have<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.310> focus<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.630> only

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750
