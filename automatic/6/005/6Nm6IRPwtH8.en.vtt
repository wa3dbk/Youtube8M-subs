00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
just pull up the same thing now let's

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.470 
just pull up the same thing now let's
see<00:02:23.310> screen<00:02:24.299> util<00:02:24.629> i<00:02:25.400> shows<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.790> information

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
see screen util i shows the information

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.210 
see screen util i shows the information
so<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.950> see<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.220> 1920<00:02:29.849> by<00:02:29.970> 1200<00:02:31.220> 32

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so here you can see it's 1920 by 1200 32

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.460 
so here you can see it's 1920 by 1200 32
bits<00:02:32.819> per<00:02:32.910> pixel<00:02:33.239> which<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.900> also<00:02:34.080> very

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
bits per pixel which is also very

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.970 
bits per pixel which is also very
important<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.010> need<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.060> let's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
important you need to know that so let's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.699 
important you need to know that so let's
go<00:02:37.980> back<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> health<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.319> s

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
go back to the health and so you use s

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.100 
go back to the health and so you use s
to<00:02:41.430> switch<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:42.150> i've<00:02:42.450> noticed

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
to switch which i've noticed

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.319 
to switch which i've noticed
does<00:02:43.349> absolutely<00:02:43.560> nothing<00:02:44.459> except<00:02:44.790> switch<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
does absolutely nothing except switch it

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.240 
does absolutely nothing except switch it
and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:45.629> switch<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.049> back<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.860> use

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and then switch it back and then you use

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
and then switch it back and then you use
T<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.660> T<00:02:48.900> command<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:50.450> accept<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
T the T command to actually accept the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
T the T command to actually accept the
changes<00:02:52.109> so<00:02:52.890> what<00:02:53.129> you're<00:02:53.220> gonna<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> do

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
changes so what you're gonna want to do

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.369 
changes so what you're gonna want to do
is<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:55.549> su<00:02:56.549> are<00:02:57.500> SCR<00:02:58.500> util<00:02:59.299> T<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.599> then<00:03:00.989> I

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
is you do su are SCR util T and then I

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.009 
is you do su are SCR util T and then I
want<00:03:02.060> 1440<00:03:03.349> space<00:03:04.349> 900<00:03:05.160> space<00:03:05.519> 32<00:03:06.420> now<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
want 1440 space 900 space 32 now the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.720 
want 1440 space 900 space 32 now the
reason<00:03:07.379> I<00:03:07.440> want<00:03:07.620> 32<00:03:08.069> on<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.250> end<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.579> because

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
reason I want 32 on the end is because

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.440 
reason I want 32 on the end is because
that's<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.239> pixel<00:03:09.750> depth<00:03:10.910> that's<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.269> bit

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that's the pixel depth that's the bit

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.880 
that's the pixel depth that's the bit
depth<00:03:12.720> per<00:03:13.349> pixel

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
depth per pixel

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.699 
depth per pixel
now<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.579> haven't<00:03:15.480> tried<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.660> leave<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.049> off<00:03:16.200> but

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
now I haven't tried to leave it off but

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.670 
now I haven't tried to leave it off but
it<00:03:16.829> doesn't<00:03:17.129> say<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.459> optional<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.560> only

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
it doesn't say it's optional so the only

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.140 
it doesn't say it's optional so the only
thing<00:03:19.859> that's<00:03:19.950> optional<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.609> refresh<00:03:21.060> rate

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
thing that's optional is a refresh rate

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.020 
thing that's optional is a refresh rate
but<00:03:21.599> with<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.079> LCDs<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.829> generally<00:03:23.579> ignored

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
but with the LCDs it's generally ignored

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.860 
but with the LCDs it's generally ignored
so<00:03:25.310> that's<00:03:26.310> basically<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.660> what

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so that's basically it now so what

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.780 
so that's basically it now so what
you're<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.139> want<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.349> do<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.790> you're

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
you're going to want to do is you're

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.849 
you're going to want to do is you're
going<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:30.000> want<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.419> automate<00:03:31.139> this<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.620> what

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
going to want to automate this so what

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.449 
going to want to automate this so what
you<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.430> fire<00:03:32.700> up<00:03:32.730> Automator

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
you have to do is fire up Automator

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.659 
you have to do is fire up Automator
basically<00:03:35.459> go<00:03:36.000> into<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:37.260> go<00:03:37.919> into<00:03:38.069> utilities

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
basically go into I go into utilities

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.860 
basically go into I go into utilities
because<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.090> where<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.269> usually<00:03:39.419> see<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
because that's where I usually see it

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.500 
because that's where I usually see it
and<00:03:40.019> then<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.139> click<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.620> hold<00:03:40.980> run<00:03:41.819> shell<00:03:42.120> script

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and then I click I hold run shell script

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.220 
and then I click I hold run shell script
just<00:03:42.840> drag<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.260> over<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:44.870> I've<00:03:45.870> already<00:03:46.049> got

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
just drag it over and I've already got

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.580 
just drag it over and I've already got
it<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.739> basically<00:03:47.389> SCR<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:49.069> SCR<00:03:50.069> util<00:03:50.760> T

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590

because<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.389> would<00:04:00.540> probably<00:04:00.750> crash<00:04:01.470> my

because that would probably crash my
screen<00:04:02.790> recording<00:04:03.239> application<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> you're

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
and then triggers so from the triggers

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.990 
and then triggers so from the triggers
here<00:04:36.630> we<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:36.870> see<00:04:37.370> hope<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.610> one's<00:04:38.790> missing

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.050 
here we can see hope this one's missing
now<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.510> I'm<00:04:39.600> going<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:40.190> let's<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.460> what<00:04:41.850> what

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
now so I'm going to let's see what what

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.230 
now so I'm going to let's see what what
did<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.300> name<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.900> named<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.770> 1920<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:44.970> I'm

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
did I name it I named it 1920 so I'm

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.300 
did I name it I named it 1920 so I'm
going<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.419> go<00:04:45.540> into<00:04:47.450> scripts<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:49.040> there<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.190> is

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
going to go into scripts and there it is

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.010 
going to go into scripts and there it is
so<00:04:50.730> that's<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> there<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.300> basically<00:04:54.900> just

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
so that's it so there I basically just

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.700 
so that's it so there I basically just
added<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.950> custom<00:04:56.340> trigger<00:04:57.230> for<00:04:58.230> some<00:04:58.410> reason

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
added the custom trigger for some reason

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.790 
added the custom trigger for some reason
it<00:04:58.889> disappeared<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.970> use<00:05:01.940> shift<00:05:02.940> command<00:05:03.570> 9<00:05:04.320> and

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
it disappeared I use shift command 9 and

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.250 
it disappeared I use shift command 9 and
shift<00:05:05.130> command<00:05:05.550> o<00:05:05.810> 0<00:05:06.919> so<00:05:08.780> 9<00:05:09.780> is<00:05:10.020> from<00:05:10.169> my

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
shift command o 0 so 9 is from my

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.379 
shift command o 0 so 9 is from my
smaller<00:05:10.560> resolution<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.400> 0<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:11.970> for<00:05:12.270> my

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
smaller resolution and 0 is for my

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.230 
smaller resolution and 0 is for my
larger<00:05:12.780> one<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.220> that's<00:05:14.220> basically<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.700> hold

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
larger one so that's basically I hold

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.510 
larger one so that's basically I hold
those<00:05:15.450> keys<00:05:15.990> down<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.830> switches<00:05:17.250> my

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
those keys down and it switches my

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.870 
those keys down and it switches my
resolution<00:05:18.240> on-the-fly<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.169> don't<00:05:19.530> have<00:05:19.680> to

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
resolution on-the-fly I don't have to

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.219 
resolution on-the-fly I don't have to
fire<00:05:20.880> up<00:05:21.090> displays<00:05:21.570> wait<00:05:22.169> for<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.680> load
