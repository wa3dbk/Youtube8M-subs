00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
the lighter buddy animal kaback we're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.160 
the lighter buddy animal kaback we're
still<00:00:12.530> with<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:12.920> respiration<00:00:13.400> and<00:00:13.960> today<00:00:14.960> we

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
still with the respiration and today we

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.049 
still with the respiration and today we
have<00:00:15.320> an<00:00:15.469> experiment

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
have an experiment

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.810 
have an experiment
to<00:00:16.840> illustrate<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.859> evolution<00:00:18.340> of<00:00:18.400> carbon

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
to illustrate the evolution of carbon

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.999 
to illustrate the evolution of carbon
dioxide<00:00:18.869> during<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.019> Arabic<00:00:20.380> respiration

and by the numbering part of the plant

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.650 
and by the numbering part of the plant
finding<00:00:27.009> these<00:00:27.430> seeds<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.669> the<00:00:31.000> seeds<00:00:31.270> do

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
finding these seeds so that the seeds do

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.259 
finding these seeds so that the seeds do
not<00:00:31.689> contain<00:00:32.169> any<00:00:32.410> chlorophyll<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.269> they're

not contain any chlorophyll and they're

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.360 
not contain any chlorophyll and they're
not<00:00:34.720> considered<00:00:35.199> in<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.620> great<00:00:35.949> part<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.280> the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
not considered in a great part of the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.990 
not considered in a great part of the
plant<00:00:36.580> they<00:00:37.059> are<00:00:37.210> non<00:00:37.449> green<00:00:37.720> bottle<00:00:38.199> event

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
plant they are non green bottle event

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.560 
plant they are non green bottle event
and<00:00:40.860> despite<00:00:41.860> this<00:00:42.100> fact<00:00:42.339> they<00:00:43.059> produce

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
and despite this fact they produce

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.899 
and despite this fact they produce
carbon<00:00:44.199> dioxide<00:00:44.230> during<00:00:45.040> their<00:00:45.220> respiration

carbon dioxide during their respiration

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.140 
carbon dioxide during their respiration
and<00:00:46.780> will<00:00:47.050> prove<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:48.369> will<00:00:48.519> have<00:00:48.699> three

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
and will prove that we will have three

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.880 
and will prove that we will have three
apprentices<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.920> are<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.280> three<00:00:52.890> almost

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
apprentices they are the three almost

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.570 
apprentices they are the three almost
the<00:00:54.159> same<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.110> first<00:00:56.320> one<00:00:56.589> the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
the same so this is the first one the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.420 
the same so this is the first one the
first<00:00:57.610> one<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.659> we<00:00:58.720> can<00:00:59.110> see<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.979> retort

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
first one and we can see is a retort

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.920 
first one and we can see is a retort
with<00:01:01.000> its<00:01:01.180> end<00:01:01.449> dipped<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:03.390> beaker<00:01:04.390> this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
with its end dipped in a beaker this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.160 
with its end dipped in a beaker this
paper<00:01:05.199> contains<00:01:05.580> potassium<00:01:06.580> hydroxide<00:01:07.210> and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
paper contains potassium hydroxide and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.820 
paper contains potassium hydroxide and
the<00:01:08.650> resource<00:01:09.340> hint<00:01:10.330> contains<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.259> group<00:01:11.590> of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
the resource hint contains a group of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.490 
the resource hint contains a group of
dry<00:01:12.460> seeds<00:01:13.030> they<00:01:13.390> are<00:01:13.420> not<00:01:13.630> germinating<00:01:14.259> seeds

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
dry seeds they are not germinating seeds

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.700 
dry seeds they are not germinating seeds
they<00:01:14.860> are<00:01:15.040> still<00:01:15.400> dry<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:17.259> is<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.500> first

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
they are still dry this is the first

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.940 
they are still dry this is the first
apparatus<00:01:19.170> okay<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.950> second<00:01:21.369> one<00:01:22.289> here<00:01:23.289> we

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
apparatus okay the second one here we

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.789 
apparatus okay the second one here we
have<00:01:23.979> also<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:25.090> retort<00:01:25.719> with<00:01:25.899> its<00:01:26.109> neck<00:01:26.380> depth

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
have also a retort with its neck depth

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.289 
have also a retort with its neck depth
in<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.999> Baker<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:29.649> beaker<00:01:29.950> contains<00:01:30.549> sodium

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
in the Baker this beaker contains sodium

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.480 
in the Baker this beaker contains sodium
could<00:01:32.109> write<00:01:32.319> instead<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:33.009> potassium

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
could write instead of potassium

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.569 
could write instead of potassium
hydroxide<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.350> also<00:01:35.350> we<00:01:35.679> have<00:01:35.859> your<00:01:36.069> seeds

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
hydroxide and also we have your seeds

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.209 
hydroxide and also we have your seeds
but<00:01:36.819> these<00:01:37.090> seeds<00:01:37.450> are<00:01:37.659> germinate<00:01:38.530> seeds<00:01:38.770> they

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
but these seeds are germinate seeds they

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.739 
but these seeds are germinate seeds they
are<00:01:39.249> not<00:01:39.869> dry<00:01:40.869> seeds<00:01:41.429> so<00:01:42.429> pieces<00:01:42.939> are<00:01:43.299> actually

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
are not dry seeds so pieces are actually

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:49.260 
are not dry seeds so pieces are actually
growing<00:01:45.600> okay<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.740> third<00:01:48.009> one<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.969> is<00:01:49.179> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
growing okay the third one this is the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.309 
growing okay the third one this is the
third<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.310> also<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.880> have<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.329> retort<00:01:52.810> with<00:01:53.259> a

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
third and also we have a retort with a

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.039 
third and also we have a retort with a
snake<00:01:53.619> dip<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.850> bigger<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.600> speaker

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
snake dip in the bigger this speaker

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.590 
snake dip in the bigger this speaker
contains<00:01:56.530> potassium<00:01:57.429> hydroxide<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.420> like

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
contains potassium hydroxide just like

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.779 
contains potassium hydroxide just like
the<00:01:58.749> first<00:01:58.899> one<00:01:59.049> while<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.039> scenes<00:02:00.280> here<00:02:00.459> are

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
the first one while the scenes here are

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.879 
the first one while the scenes here are
just<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.450> second<00:02:01.810> one<00:02:01.959> germinating

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
just like the second one germinating

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.800 
just like the second one germinating
seeds<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:05.109> three<00:02:05.439> results<00:02:05.979> will<00:02:06.399> be<00:02:06.810> left

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
seeds so the three results will be left

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.980 
seeds so the three results will be left
for<00:02:10.830> some<00:02:11.830> time<00:02:12.100> in<00:02:12.730> order<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.090> perform<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
for some time in order to perform the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410 
for some time in order to perform the
respiration<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:15.520> observe<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
respiration and we will observe the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.400 
respiration and we will observe the
breath<00:02:16.690> oohs<00:02:16.870> we<00:02:17.770> are<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.250> set<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
breath oohs we are not to set the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.340 
breath oohs we are not to set the
association<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
association of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.860 
association of
potassium<00:02:22.710> hydroxide<00:02:23.250> we're<00:02:24.000> wise<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
potassium hydroxide we're wise in the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.140 
potassium hydroxide we're wise in the
third<00:02:25.140> retort<00:02:25.770> which<00:02:26.100> contain<00:02:26.490> germinating

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
third retort which contain germinating

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.340 
third retort which contain germinating
seeds<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:29.250> level<00:02:30.240> will<00:02:30.480> rise<00:02:30.690> through<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
seeds it's level will rise through the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.850 
seeds it's level will rise through the
neck<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.220> retorts<00:02:33.080> while<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.320> two<00:02:34.500> others

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
neck of the retorts while the two others

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
neck of the retorts while the two others
it<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.690> why<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.020> an

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it what so why is this here we have an

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.610 
it what so why is this here we have an
interpretation<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.250> part<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
interpretation for this part in the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.510 
interpretation for this part in the
first<00:02:43.830> retort<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.850> had<00:02:45.090> dry<00:02:45.780> seeds<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.130> these

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
first retort we had dry seeds so these

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.190 
first retort we had dry seeds so these
dry<00:02:47.820> seeds<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.900> not<00:02:48.930> respire<00:02:50.120> they<00:02:51.120> are<00:02:51.330> kind

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
dry seeds do not respire they are kind

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.770 
dry seeds do not respire they are kind
of<00:02:52.290> dead<00:02:52.590> they're<00:02:53.130> not<00:02:53.370> respiring<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:54.720> are

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
of dead they're not respiring they are

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.500 
of dead they're not respiring they are
not<00:02:54.960> active<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.330> perform

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
not active so they do not perform

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.530 
not active so they do not perform
respiration<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.370> carbon<00:02:59.910> dioxide<00:03:00.000> isn't

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
respiration and so carbon dioxide isn't

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.250 
respiration and so carbon dioxide isn't
up<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.170> not<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.430> happen<00:03:02.640> in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
up to this and not to just happen in

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.020 
up to this and not to just happen in
apparatus<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:05.370> average<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.810> have

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
apparatus one in average do we have

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.100 
apparatus one in average do we have
germinating<00:03:09.030> seeds<00:03:09.270> while<00:03:09.780> these

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
germinating seeds while these

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
germinating seeds while these
germinating<00:03:10.800> seeds<00:03:11.040> respire<00:03:11.790> actively<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
germinating seeds respire actively and

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.050 
germinating seeds respire actively and
they<00:03:12.930> produce<00:03:13.170> carbon<00:03:13.680> dioxide<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.730> because

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
they produce carbon dioxide but because

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.180 
they produce carbon dioxide but because
the<00:03:15.210> sodium<00:03:15.510> chloride<00:03:16.020> doesn't<00:03:16.710> absorb<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the sodium chloride doesn't absorb the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.310 
the sodium chloride doesn't absorb the
carbon<00:03:17.370> dioxide<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.780> gaseous<00:03:19.140> exchange

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
carbon dioxide the gaseous exchange

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.160 
carbon dioxide the gaseous exchange
happen<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.520> part<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.180> germinating

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
happen in a part of the germinating

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.030 
happen in a part of the germinating
seeds<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:24.150> volume<00:03:24.630> stays<00:03:25.040> constant

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
seeds and the volume stays constant

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.410 
seeds and the volume stays constant
because<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.970> equal<00:03:27.470> amount<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:29.420> carbon

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
because the equal amount of carbon

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.920 
because the equal amount of carbon
dioxide<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:31.170> produced<00:03:31.640> as<00:03:32.640> an<00:03:33.330> equal<00:03:33.630> amount

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
dioxide is produced as an equal amount

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.980 
dioxide is produced as an equal amount
of<00:03:34.110> oxygen<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.220> absorbed<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.660> volume

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
of oxygen is absorbed so the volume

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.170 
of oxygen is absorbed so the volume
stays<00:03:37.200> constant<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:37.980> no<00:03:38.280> changes<00:03:38.760> happening

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
stays constant and no changes happening

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.960 
stays constant and no changes happening
this<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.010> second<00:03:41.610> one<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
this this is for the second one the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.080 
this this is for the second one the
third<00:03:42.360> one<00:03:43.190> contains<00:03:44.190> germinating<00:03:44.850> seeds

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
third one contains germinating seeds

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.930 
third one contains germinating seeds
there<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.840> fire<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.380> they<00:03:47.070> produce<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.490> carbon

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
there is fire and they produce a carbon

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.510 
there is fire and they produce a carbon
dioxide<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.930> because<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.620> potassium

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
dioxide and because this potassium

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.290 
dioxide and because this potassium
hydroxide<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.390> able<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.440> absorb<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.760> reduced

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
hydroxide is able to absorb the reduced

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.620 
hydroxide is able to absorb the reduced
carbon<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.500> level<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.640> potassium<00:03:57.300> what

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
carbon the level of it potassium what

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.950 
carbon the level of it potassium what
excites<00:03:58.050> rise<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.870> absorbs<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
excites rise up as it absorbs the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.980 
excites rise up as it absorbs the
produce<00:04:01.410> carbon<00:04:01.830> dioxide<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.810> level

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
produce carbon dioxide and so the level

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.250 
produce carbon dioxide and so the level
rises<00:04:04.980> up<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.150> change<00:04:06.420> take<00:04:06.780> place<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
rises up and the change take place and

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.500 
rises up and the change take place and
this<00:04:07.920> indicates<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.790> carbon<00:04:09.450> dioxide<00:04:09.480> is

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
this indicates that carbon dioxide is

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.200 
this indicates that carbon dioxide is
evolved<00:04:12.510> during<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.380> aerobic<00:04:13.920> respiration

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
evolved during the aerobic respiration

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.120 
evolved during the aerobic respiration
so<00:04:15.210> we<00:04:15.450> conclude<00:04:15.870> three<00:04:16.230> things<00:04:16.530> from<00:04:16.830> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
so we conclude three things from this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.840 
so we conclude three things from this
experiment<00:04:17.670> one<00:04:18.150> dry<00:04:18.720> cease<00:04:18.989> do<00:04:19.200> not<00:04:19.350> respire

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
experiment one dry cease do not respire

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.500 
experiment one dry cease do not respire
second<00:04:20.870> germinating<00:04:21.870> seeds<00:04:22.140> for<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.510> lively

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
second germinating seeds for the lively

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.810 
second germinating seeds for the lively
seeds<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.170> active<00:04:25.560> see<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:26.070> carry<00:04:26.490> out<00:04:26.670> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
seeds the active see that carry out the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.560 
seeds the active see that carry out the
respiration

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
respiration

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.840 
respiration
they<00:04:28.230> produce<00:04:28.440> carbon<00:04:28.980> dioxide<00:04:29.040> during<00:04:29.700> this

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
they produce carbon dioxide during this

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.309 
they produce carbon dioxide during this
process<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.500> last<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
process and the last in that the

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.040 
process and the last in that the
amount<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.189> carbon<00:04:34.699> dioxide<00:04:34.809> produced<00:04:35.809> during

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
amount of carbon dioxide produced during

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.309 
amount of carbon dioxide produced during
the<00:04:36.229> process<00:04:37.189> of<00:04:37.219> respiration<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:38.119> equal<00:04:39.110> to

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
the process of respiration is equal to

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.529 
the process of respiration is equal to
the<00:04:39.469> amount<00:04:39.649> of<00:04:39.860> dissolved<00:04:40.219> oxygen<00:04:40.580> during

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
the amount of dissolved oxygen during

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.749 
the amount of dissolved oxygen during
the<00:04:42.080> process<00:04:42.469> of<00:04:42.559> respiration<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.460> that's

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
the process of respiration and that's

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.209 
the process of respiration and that's
why<00:04:43.969> the<00:04:44.029> level<00:04:44.389> of<00:04:44.719> the<00:04:44.960> soothing<00:04:45.800> pariah

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
why the level of the soothing pariah

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.749 
why the level of the soothing pariah
didn't<00:04:46.669> rise<00:04:46.909> in<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.930> retort<00:04:48.499> because<00:04:49.159> no

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
didn't rise in the retort because no

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.339 
didn't rise in the retort because no
boolean<00:04:50.330> changes<00:04:51.110> happened<00:04:51.619> in<00:04:51.759> this<00:04:53.349> embrace

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
boolean changes happened in this embrace

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.249 
boolean changes happened in this embrace
so<00:04:55.009> this<00:04:55.580> was<00:04:55.819> our<00:04:56.029> experiment<00:04:56.719> today<00:04:56.749> the

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
so this was our experiment today the

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.659 
so this was our experiment today the
next<00:04:57.529> time<00:04:57.710> we<00:04:57.979> will<00:04:58.129> have<00:04:58.339> the<00:04:58.490> same

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
next time we will have the same

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.850 
next time we will have the same
experiment<00:04:59.330> but<00:04:59.479> dealing<00:05:00.020> with<00:05:00.319> the<00:05:00.529> green

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
experiment but dealing with the green

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.129 
experiment but dealing with the green
parts<00:05:01.309> of<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.520> plan<00:05:01.759> the<00:05:02.419> stem<00:05:02.689> and<00:05:02.869> leaves

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
parts of a plan the stem and leaves

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.230 
parts of a plan the stem and leaves
until<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.129> next<00:05:04.249> time<00:05:04.460> is<00:05:04.819> thank<00:05:05.029> you<00:05:05.089> for
