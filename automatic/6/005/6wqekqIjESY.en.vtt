close<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.800> picture<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:39.510> don't<00:00:40.510> know<00:00:40.690> it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
close to the picture I don't know it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.570 
close to the picture I don't know it
doesn't<00:00:41.019> seem<00:00:41.440> very<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.800> mean<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.280> like<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.550> way

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
doesn't seem very I mean I like the way

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.229 
doesn't seem very I mean I like the way
it<00:00:42.760> folds<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.150> guess<00:00:43.420> like<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:44.650> feels<00:00:44.980> happy<00:00:45.430> but

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
it folds I guess like it feels happy but

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.290 
it folds I guess like it feels happy but
it's<00:00:46.420> really<00:00:46.570> not<00:00:46.839> I<00:00:47.140> mean<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:48.970> their<00:00:49.089> lack

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
it's really not I mean so is their lack

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.479 
it's really not I mean so is their lack
sauce<00:00:49.600> actually<00:00:49.809> in<00:00:50.170> this<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.680> guess<00:00:50.949> so<00:00:51.190> maybe

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
sauce actually in this I guess so maybe

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.319 
sauce actually in this I guess so maybe
that's<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.730> point<00:00:51.820> of<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:52.000> Big<00:00:52.180> Mac<00:00:52.210> oh<00:00:53.039> wow<00:00:54.329> is

fillings so I mean it's kind of a little
skimpy<00:02:59.709> on<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> meat<00:03:00.250> rather<00:03:01.120> than

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
skimpy on the meat rather than

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
thing I can say is maybe a little bit

more<00:03:15.640> meat<00:03:15.819> or<00:03:15.940> just<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.209> bit<00:03:16.360> more

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
more meat or just a little bit more

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.410 
more meat or just a little bit more
filling<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:16.989> general<00:03:17.319> because<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.560> mean<00:03:17.709> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
filling in general because I mean I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.559 
filling in general because I mean I
don't<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.569> how<00:03:19.660> does<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.870> look<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.569> but

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
don't know how does that look to you but

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.970 
don't know how does that look to you but
a<00:03:22.600> little<00:03:22.750> bit<00:03:22.959> more<00:03:23.110> filling<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.560> general<00:03:23.890> I
