00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
spawned right next to me and I just

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.149 
spawned right next to me and I just
didn't<00:01:55.049> end<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.200> killing<00:01:55.409> myself<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:56.040> once

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
with the easy

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.980 
with the easy
can't<00:01:57.890> say<00:01:58.040> happens<00:01:58.370> too<00:01:58.520> often<00:01:58.730> I'm<00:01:59.660> gonna<00:01:59.840> go

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
can't say happens too often I'm gonna go

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.300 
can't say happens too often I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.320> try<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.470> use<00:02:00.650> my<00:02:00.800> javelin<00:02:00.980> spot

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.360 
ahead and try to use my javelin spot
again<00:02:01.580> this<00:02:01.760> time<00:02:01.970> not<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.390> setting<00:02:02.690> myself

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
again this time not to setting myself

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.740 
again this time not to setting myself
this<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> pretty<00:02:04.850> effective<00:02:05.060> spot

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
this can be a pretty effective spot

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.230 
this can be a pretty effective spot
especially<00:02:05.900> if<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.470> have<00:02:06.650> like<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:07.100> hairier<00:02:07.970> up

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
especially if you have like a hairier up

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.969 
especially if you have like a hairier up
or<00:02:08.390> something<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.929> or<00:02:09.110> killstreaks<00:02:09.800> up

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
or something like that or killstreaks up

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.970 
or something like that or killstreaks up
and<00:02:10.250> they<00:02:10.550> have<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> flag<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.830> to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
and they have the a flag and you have to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.490 
and they have the a flag and you have to
see<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.300> B<00:02:14.450> flag<00:02:14.690> they'll<00:02:14.960> spawn<00:02:15.260> on

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
see in the the B flag they'll spawn on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.160 
see in the the B flag they'll spawn on
the<00:02:15.560> other<00:02:15.710> side<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:17.030> tunnel<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.720> then

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the other side of this tunnel and then

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.390 
the other side of this tunnel and then
they'll<00:02:18.350> just<00:02:18.530> kind<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.800> run<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.220> here

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
they'll just kind of run right in here

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240 
they'll just kind of run right in here
so<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.080> useful<00:02:21.200> definitely<00:02:22.160> got

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
so can be really useful definitely got

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.010 
so can be really useful definitely got
in<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.400> quads<00:02:22.640> from<00:02:22.820> this<00:02:22.940> spot<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.600> couple

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
in the quads from this spot a couple

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.960 
in the quads from this spot a couple
times<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.470> send<00:02:24.650> up<00:02:24.830> getting<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.370> pair<00:02:25.880> of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
times just send up getting a pair of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.940 
times just send up getting a pair of
singles<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:26.420> there<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.740> looks<00:02:27.860> like

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
singles right there and it looks like

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.860 
singles right there and it looks like
they<00:02:28.220> capped<00:02:28.670> C<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.120> means<00:02:29.240> we<00:02:29.630> should

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
they capped C so that means we should

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.960 
they capped C so that means we should
push<00:02:30.020> up<00:02:30.170> at<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.890> try<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> get<00:02:31.580> him<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.760> single

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
push up at a and try to get him a single

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.180 
push up at a and try to get him a single
cap<00:02:32.270> but<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.570> could<00:02:32.690> see<00:02:32.840> down<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.230> that's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
cap but you could see down there that's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.350 
cap but you could see down there that's
what<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.400> talking<00:02:34.640> about<00:02:34.700> there<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:34.940> camp

you're like what the noob tube was like
literally<00:03:08.120> got<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.290> from<00:03:09.440> across<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.830> map

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
literally got you from across the map

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.380 
literally got you from across the map
there's<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.280> couple<00:03:10.489> places<00:03:10.640> where<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.269> do

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
there's a couple places where you can do

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.300 
there's a couple places where you can do
that<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.350> shoot<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.799> up<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.100> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
that and they can shoot it up on the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.610 
that and they can shoot it up on the
ledge<00:03:13.489> up<00:03:13.850> by<00:03:14.180> sea<00:03:14.510> flag<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.080> everything<00:03:15.440> it's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
ledge up by sea flag and everything it's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.360 
ledge up by sea flag and everything it's
just<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:16.280> gets<00:03:16.459> kind<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.730> wild<00:03:17.060> but<00:03:18.280> yeah<00:03:19.280> it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
just it gets kind of wild but yeah it

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.470 
just it gets kind of wild but yeah it
looks<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:19.610> I'm<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.850> -<00:03:20.030> off<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.299> decent

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
looks like I'm on - off to a decent

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.030 
looks like I'm on - off to a decent
start<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.780> don't<00:03:20.989> know<00:03:21.080> if<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.230> died<00:03:21.290> before<00:03:21.799> I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
start I don't know if I died before I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.220 
start I don't know if I died before I
start<00:03:22.340> on<00:03:22.370> my<00:03:22.489> streak<00:03:22.730> or<00:03:22.850> not<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> guess

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
start on my streak or not so I guess

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.590 
start on my streak or not so I guess
we'll<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.830> little<00:03:24.950> bit<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.600> but

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
we'll see here in a little bit but but

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.710 
we'll see here in a little bit but but
man<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:27.080> really<00:03:27.890> do<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.730> game<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.480> it's

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
man I really do like this game and it's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.100 
man I really do like this game and it's
and<00:03:30.380> unfortunately<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> Xbox<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.150> try<00:03:33.049> to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and unfortunately the Xbox one I try to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.930 
and unfortunately the Xbox one I try to
do<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> Ox<00:03:33.799> out<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.310> don't<00:03:34.489> maybe<00:03:34.700> I'm<00:03:34.850> not

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
do the Ox out I don't maybe I'm not

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.240 
do the Ox out I don't maybe I'm not
doing<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.269> right<00:03:35.440> with<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.590> game<00:03:36.769> recorder<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
doing it right with the game recorder I

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.560 
doing it right with the game recorder I
think<00:03:37.489> that's<00:03:37.610> probably<00:03:37.790> why<00:03:38.030> it's<00:03:38.299> cuz<00:03:38.450> it

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
think that's probably why it's cuz it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.780 
think that's probably why it's cuz it
won't<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:38.930> through<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.230> game<00:03:39.380> recorder

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
won't go through the game recorder

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.490 
won't go through the game recorder

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
software and that's kind of what we need

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.199 
software and that's kind of what we need
or<00:03:42.799> what<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> need<00:03:43.250> at<00:03:43.400> least<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.090> look

man at the holographic it's such an
accurate<00:03:51.920> shot<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.850> makes<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.360> nice<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.720> I

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
accurate shot it makes it so nice and I

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.880 
accurate shot it makes it so nice and I

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
was trying to pick up the extra javelin

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.860 
was trying to pick up the extra javelin
but<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> didn't<00:03:56.670> see<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:56.940> gotta<00:03:57.600> be<00:03:57.660> careful

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
but I didn't see it gotta be careful

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.059 
but I didn't see it gotta be careful
always<00:03:58.140> when<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.440> come<00:03:58.560> up<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.830> ledge

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
always when you come up to this ledge

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.160 
always when you come up to this ledge
because<00:03:59.310> there's<00:03:59.640> snipers<00:03:59.880> usually<00:04:00.540> from

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
because there's snipers usually from

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.410 
because there's snipers usually from
across<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.620> way<00:04:01.770> so<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.340> don't<00:04:02.550> know<00:04:03.120> how<00:04:03.390> I

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
across the way so I I don't know how I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.930 
across the way so I I don't know how I
got<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.319> just<00:04:04.560> about<00:04:04.740> got<00:04:04.940> squished

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
got that and I just about got squished

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.340 
got that and I just about got squished
by<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.270> care<00:04:06.450> package<00:04:06.600> right<00:04:06.900> there<00:04:06.959> if<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
by that care package right there if I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.260 
by that care package right there if I
just<00:04:07.590> didn't<00:04:07.830> watch<00:04:08.400> myself<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.000> could<00:04:09.150> have

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
just didn't watch myself I could have

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.150 
just didn't watch myself I could have
definitely<00:04:09.780> gotten<00:04:09.959> too<00:04:10.080> handled<00:04:10.290> by<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:10.440> so

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
definitely gotten too handled by that so

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.810 
definitely gotten too handled by that so
I'm<00:04:11.310> trying<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:12.320> get<00:04:13.320> down<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.160> kills<00:04:14.670> to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
I'm trying to get down to this kills to

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.240 
I'm trying to get down to this kills to
get<00:04:15.000> my<00:04:15.090> hairy<00:04:15.300> wrap<00:04:15.709> just<00:04:16.709> running<00:04:17.040> kind<00:04:17.160> of

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
get my hairy wrap just running kind of

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.050 
get my hairy wrap just running kind of
over<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:17.579> way

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
over this way

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.630 
over this way
and<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:20.040> thought<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.370> was<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.519> guy

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
and I think I thought that was a guy

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.590 
and I think I thought that was a guy
that<00:04:20.790> ran<00:04:20.880> right<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.209> front<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.390> me<00:04:21.510> or

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
that ran right in front of me or

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.860 
that ran right in front of me or
something<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.240 

gotta<00:04:25.320> be<00:04:25.440> careful<00:04:25.560> when<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:25.919> come<00:04:26.070> through

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
gotta be careful when you come through

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.010 
gotta be careful when you come through
the<00:04:26.400> middle<00:04:26.730> holla<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.120> think<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.510> want

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
the middle holla I think so I want

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.950 
the middle holla I think so I want
around<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.610> now<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:29.760> know<00:04:29.910> they<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.240> be<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.750> in

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
around so now I know they have be in in

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.900 
around so now I know they have be in in
a<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.560> they're<00:04:32.010> gonna<00:04:32.130> be<00:04:32.280> spotted<00:04:32.640> more

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
a so they're gonna be spotted more

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.210 
a so they're gonna be spotted more
towards<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.840> B<00:04:33.990> side<00:04:34.260> so<00:04:34.530> I'm<00:04:34.650> gonna<00:04:34.770> flank

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
towards the B side so I'm gonna flank

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.550
