00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.030
 was given 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.820
 Tell me guys, it's talking about half a kilo. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.290
 welcome to another video and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.180
 today I would like to bring 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.670
 for you some news that are 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.440
 circulating on the internet about the game 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.760
 model for 4 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.039
 You must be wondering halfway. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.530
 but they will already launch a module was 4 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 I just bought my black ops 2 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.750
 Calm down, my friend, calm down. 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.150
 time the module was released 4s only on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 end of the year more precisely in the month of 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.850
 November 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 just clarify a few things to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 You that you must be finding 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.489
 so strange to people who do not 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 are still familiar with the series 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 call of duty is that every year we have 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.400
 a new franchise game right? 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 just to clarify this for you is that 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.170
 so the call of duty series is basically 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 divided into two studios nowadays one 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.570
 study is called the treyarch she says is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.830
 is responsible for the black series games 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.870
 ops and another studio is endless air that is 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.650
 responsible for the games of the modern series 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.390
 warfare 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.119
 so that's why we always have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.079
 every year a new game called Call of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.670
 duty 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.549
 good people, you must have noticed 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 So that's playing the gameplay of money. 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.450
 for 3 of campaign mode nÃ© 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.579
 I put this gameplay because the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 module was 4 will have some scenes of 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.229
 flashback with the standard series media 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.920
 right of call, which are scenes where you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.840
 Do you remember what happens? 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 events of the previous games and the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 face that will have these memories these 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.909
 flash backs will be a new character 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.399
 main and fashion series was 4 that by 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.890
 while it bears the name of good because it is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.170
 a comrade of about 30 years 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.119
 in certain parts of the game it goes 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.460
 have these flashbacks and one of those flash 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.679
 backs and where it shows a phase in somalia 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.049
 that it is not quite this phase that you are 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.420
 following but I ended up putting her 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.130
 because I think in the end it's going to be this 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 phase that will show already that it will have 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.600
 memories of the captain of a single piquet 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.819
 captain messi tevez where he finishes 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 dying such has that scene really sad 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.610
 and I think what the ben bernanke 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.500
 Sorry he's going to do these little ones. 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.570
 memories such 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.380
 the points that happened in the module were 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.770
 3 one of the other things is that the voice actor 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 of captain price has already been called by 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.130
 inffinito air 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.100
 he started to make the recording is the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.600
 dubbing the voice of Captain Beach then 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.370
 then things are probably already good 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.260
 early is this one until a news 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.220
 a little old is already a news of the year 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:49.230
 of 2012 where he was interviewed was 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.510
 asked if he wants to send it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.489
 was served and he ended up confirming 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.690
 that he had already been approached by the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.360
 make to voice the character 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.800
 captain price and then you should 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.380
 be asking yourself 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.020
 half a pound I buy monauer 4 for 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.650
 video games of the current generation or I expect 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.170
 launch the playstation 4 an xbox 720 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.500
 as well staff for now still nothing 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.080
 was confirmed is concrete if Jorge 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.660
 the warm game was 4 will be released to 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.810
 the new generation but from what I could 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.790
 understand what I could perceive and even 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.000
 I'll explain to you, I believe 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.220
 sure fashion was 4 will be released 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.530
 only for the current generation of consoles can 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.500
 be released later 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.330
 but I do not think so by the following 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.510
 reasons first because playstation 4 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.310
 xbox 720 have not even been announced know 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.459
 God when they will be announced and when 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.019
 will be released second because there is 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.120
 call of duty series as you know you already have 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.190
 a half-outdated graphics engine, so I 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.950
 I do not think it's very convenient 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.660
 to launch a series game for a console 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.720
 new generation with the same engine 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.150
 graph so I guess when they 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.250
 have launched a new call of duty for tom and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.310
 for the new generation of consoles will be 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.709
 the black ops 3 that will be produced by 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.160
 treyarch and then yes I believe that it attracts 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.290
 which should be developing a new 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.690
 indjai in the new graphic engine such as 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.120
 yes the game is released for the new 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.880
 generation of consoles I think with the current 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.169
 is indjai current graphics engine the game 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.860
 still going to be released both for 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.800
 playstation 3 xbox 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.810
 360 and pc at least that's what I could 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.969
 to confirm that I was able to prove 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.069
 I think the most correct thing is 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.870
 thing that they can do 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.870
 another thing I wanted to talk to 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.580
 You 're the ones that have not yet been 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.800
 confirmed if the game will have a version 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.349
 for the nintendo consoles but if the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.689
 people look recently and even finished 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.150
 launching black ops 2 for nintendo wii 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.909
 wheel then believes that finally 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.460
 will also do the same by throwing fashion 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.710
 was 4 for the nintendo consoles already 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.840
 what is one wanting is not a big one 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.240
 slice and players they end up 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.370
 conquering and there are also people who 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.990
 like the call of duty series in 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.419
 Nintendo consoles still more after 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.669
 of the beautiful work is to train 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.300
 launch the black ops 2 for nintendo wii 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.889
 u 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.039
