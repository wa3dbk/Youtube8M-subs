experiment with new materials

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.330 
experiment with new materials
I<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.570> when<00:01:25.810> when<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.830> have<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.009> material

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
I like when when you have a material

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.149 
I like when when you have a material
which<00:01:27.729> num<00:01:28.090> have<00:01:28.780> used<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.619> way<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.830> want

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
which num have used in that way you want

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.520 
which num have used in that way you want
to<00:01:30.310> use<00:01:30.640> it<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.299> it's<00:01:31.479> more<00:01:31.840> open<00:01:32.290> for<00:01:32.470> your

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
to use it and it's more open for your

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.370 
to use it and it's more open for your
mind<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.189> be<00:01:33.340> creative<00:01:33.880> around<00:01:34.180> because<00:01:35.140> you

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
mind to be creative around because you

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
mind to be creative around because you
don't<00:01:36.009> have<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.159> picture<00:01:36.460> before<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.240> start

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
don't have a picture before you start

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.160 
don't have a picture before you start
what<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.799> do<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.580> have<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:40.170> learn

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
what you can do you just have to learn

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.490 
what you can do you just have to learn
basically<00:01:42.479> concrete<00:01:43.479> canvas<00:01:43.750> was<00:01:44.110> originally

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
basically concrete canvas was originally

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.930 
basically concrete canvas was originally
developed<00:01:44.770> as<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.159> construction<00:01:45.820> material

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
developed as a construction material

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.389 
developed as a construction material
it's<00:01:46.899> more<00:01:47.080> flexible<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.799> easier<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.280> work

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
it's more flexible and easier to work

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's more flexible and easier to work
with<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.909> regular<00:01:49.330> concrete<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.840> gets

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
with and regular concrete when it gets

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.680 
with and regular concrete when it gets
wet<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.590> starts<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.159> harden<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:58.090> material<00:01:58.569> is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
wet it starts to harden the material is

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.779 
wet it starts to harden the material is
used<00:01:58.990> for<00:01:59.170> building<00:01:59.560> fire<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.280> waterproof

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
used for building fire and waterproof

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.149 
used for building fire and waterproof
shelters<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.479> crisis<00:02:01.929> areas<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.649> challenge

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
shelters in crisis areas the challenge

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.930 
shelters in crisis areas the challenge
is<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:07.600> understand<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:09.100> possibilities<00:02:09.759> of

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
is to to understand the possibilities of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.729 
is to to understand the possibilities of
it<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.330> also<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.810> work<00:02:11.110> around<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.650> very

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
it and also to work around it's very

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.420 
it and also to work around it's very
dusty<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.519> heavy<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:15.220> learn

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
dusty and heavy and so on and to learn

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.080 
dusty and heavy and so on and to learn
how<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:16.920> yeah<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.160> how<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> put<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> together

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
how to yeah like how to put it together

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.050 
how to yeah like how to put it together
like<00:02:19.750> what<00:02:20.049> should<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.319> use<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.920> should<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.670> sew<00:02:22.030> it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like what should I use I should I sew it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
like what should I use I should I sew it
together<00:02:22.420> should<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:24.130> know<00:02:24.280> use<00:02:24.840> what<00:02:25.840> kind

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
together should I you know use what kind

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.640 
together should I you know use what kind

it's<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.800> interesting<00:02:47.190> once<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.850> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it's very interesting once you put the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
water on top of it I think because then

you have you don't have so much time

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.170 
you have you don't have so much time
maybe<00:02:54.540> 30<00:02:55.350> minutes<00:02:55.620> because<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.280> starts<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
maybe 30 minutes because it starts to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.860

get hard quite quickly but it takes

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.110 
get hard quite quickly but it takes
about<00:03:01.140> 24<00:03:01.890> hours<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.520> concrete<00:03:02.910> to
