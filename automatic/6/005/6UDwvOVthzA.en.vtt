professional I mean this guy turned pro

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
professional I mean this guy turned pro
at<00:01:05.640> 20<00:01:05.970> years<00:01:06.090> old<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.720> guys<00:01:06.869> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
at 20 years old and some guys just

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
at 20 years old and some guys just
barely<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> high<00:01:07.590> school<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.979> 20<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:09.170> guess

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
barely out of high school at 20 I guess

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.609 
barely out of high school at 20 I guess
I<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.590> 26<00:01:11.240> 27<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> average<00:01:13.290> age

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
I was about 26 27 but the average age

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
I was about 26 27 but the average age
for<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.950> pros<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.479> average<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
for the pros I think on the average like

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
for the pros I think on the average like
27<00:01:16.560> 28<00:01:16.830> years<00:01:16.920> old

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
27 28 years old

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
27 28 years old
so<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> getting<00:01:18.030> younger<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.330> younger<00:01:18.479> as

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so the getting younger and younger as

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.539 
so the getting younger and younger as
they<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.590> more<00:01:19.650> involved<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> weight

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
they get more involved in weight

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
they get more involved in weight
training<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.939> younger<00:01:21.180> ages<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.619> think

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
training at younger ages and I think

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.969 
training at younger ages and I think
that<00:01:22.979> accounts<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> fantastic

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that accounts for a lot of the fantastic

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
that accounts for a lot of the fantastic
develop<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.430> guys<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.939> Lee<00:01:27.180> jet<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.689> they

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
develop out guys like Lee jet as they

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.660 
develop out guys like Lee jet as they
get<00:01:28.290> into<00:01:28.500> their<00:01:28.619> 20s<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.430> start

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
get into their 20s they just start

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.930 
get into their 20s they just start
younger<00:01:30.329> yeah<00:01:30.659> absolutely

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.320 

that's<00:01:36.940> it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
that's it

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that's it
knock<00:01:37.570> them<00:01:37.690> out<00:01:39.240> Lee<00:01:40.240> how<00:01:40.390> much<00:01:40.540> weight<00:01:40.690> I<00:01:40.720> go

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
knock them out Lee how much weight I go

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.320
