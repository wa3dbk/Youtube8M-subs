00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello everyone with you again valentine and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.720
 us today will be very subject 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.349
 interesting today's lesson we start 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.119
 a trilogy of lessons first lesson we will have 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:34.200
 how to change eye color 2 how to change 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.620
 lip color and 3 will change hair color 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.210
 including eyebrows 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.989
 lessons will not be long 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.640
 so you do not even have time to get tired 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:55.309
 difficult no lesson for beginners 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 Basically this is a lesson for photographers since 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.540
 always change photos for the better 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.560
 It was crucial for any photographer and 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 so this is our original source 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 which will be at the end of all three lessons 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.289
 we get here such a photo as 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.899
 see the color of your mother's changed 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:23.090
 eyebrow hair and lips photography became 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.190
 more interesting 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.890
 girls appeared such a mysterious look 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.670
 Now if you compare with the original too 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 pretty good photo was taken 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.460
 she studios using lighting 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 appliances 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 but when processing it can already calmly 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.070
 act for advertising and so 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 let's start the first lesson 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:04.170
 first lesson I remind you how to change 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:07.250
 eye color so we need first of all 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 let's enlarge our photo 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.670
 increase so that we can freely 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.700
 highlight our eyes 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:26.510
 give somewhere here so choose a tool 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.510
 pen and start to allocate slowly 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.850
 we are in no hurry therefore 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:40.220
 do everything neatly immediately advise you 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:44.920
 deal with such processing itself 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.730
 late before the release of the photo print 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.730
 or online 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.050
 retouching is done before 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.920
 we remove all that to us so the first eye we 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.260
 have finished 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.260
 let's select now the second eye 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:12.920
 continuing our conversation after you 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:16.650
 have already cleansed your model skin 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.049
 all color correction 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.239
 that is, when your photo is ready 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.239
 but not enough of any highlights 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.629
 here then you start to proceed or 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.650
 experiment with eyes with lips 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.650
 hair eyelashes and eyebrows 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.230
 it happens that not enough are underlined 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.320
 some small parts that can 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 strongly embellish our photos so 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:53.260
 the eyes we have highlighted now what we need 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:57.340
 let's take our feathers inside our eyes and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.020
 click the right mouse button here we are like 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.840
 always choose to form the highlighted 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.690
 region 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.480
 feathering put 3 pixels tick 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.099
 smooth click ok 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.540
 Here we have this 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.780
 feather and 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 selected areas of the eyes now click 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.240
 on the keyboard contour 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.650
 jay our eyes 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.970
 as you see identified on the new layer 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:33.490
 now what do we need now we go to 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.979
 menu, select the image in the panel 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.400
 here choose the correction and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.400
 color tone saturation 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.100
 here are our eyes let's do this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.080
 put our tool 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.419
 here in this box we choose 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.419
 toning put a tick as you can see 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.330
 eye color immediately changed with us 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.419
 let's make our eyes bigger 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.550
 suitable for photos 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.430
 best of course my eyes I advise you 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.130
 when you pick up color photos 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.160
 make it so that you have it remotely 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.520
 to see the whole portrait completely 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.300
 then it will harmoniously affect 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.820
 what you are trying to do will be seen as 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.690
 suitable eye or is not appropriate and so 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.280
 let's do i think green like u 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.680
 me in the original so saturation is it 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.639
 us 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.699
 increases color 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.699
 in the left I reduce let's do the eyes 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.800
 like this somewhere brightness for itself 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.690
 He speaks 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:56.000
 left darker right brighter 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:59.250
 set to 0 I think ok let's click ok 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.400
 let's distribute our photo as 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:07.140
 see eye we become changed 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:12.650
 very beautiful if you want to give 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:16.310
 eyes glassiness so that they were 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.009
 more colorful then you can overlay mode 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.810
 choose overlap then we 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.810
 This is the effect 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.150
 can also try 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:34.550
 soft light is also a good result well 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.740
 principle you can play with overlay 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.740
 yourself as you like 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.529
 let's look at the overlap 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.949
 principle ok 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.949
 So 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:59.339
 you can still adjust the eye color 

00:06:55.489 --> 00:07:03.989
 if it seems to you that the color is very green 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:05.689
 or a different color but very bright then 

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:10.940
 here in the graph 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:14.689
 opacity can change 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.719
 color condition 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:20.769
 changing its transparency but me 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.769
 one hundred percent satisfied 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:28.810
