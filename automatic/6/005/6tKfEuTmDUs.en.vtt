00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and here we have the first kilobit I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
and here we have the first kilobit I
ever<00:00:38.850> made<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.530> probably<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.430> favorite<00:00:42.260> is

my favorite and it had a stand built

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
my favorite and it had a stand built
form<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.239> supposed<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.540> be

form because these is supposed to be

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
form because these is supposed to be
floating<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.559> access<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> satellite<00:00:50.190> what

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
floating just access to satellite what

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.569 
floating just access to satellite what
does<00:00:50.670> satellites<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.360> float

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
does satellites do they float

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
does satellites do they float
articulation<00:00:53.579> yeah<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.420> four<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's these main little wings here I can
be<00:00:59.220> split<00:00:59.430> out<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:03.510> he<00:01:03.629> forms<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.050> little

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
be split out and then he forms a little

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.430 
be split out and then he forms a little
satellite<00:01:04.470> guy<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:07.020> weird

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
satellite guy it's weird

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.560 
satellite guy it's weird
cuz<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.429> have<00:01:08.610> him<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.509> he

kill of it tomorrow will be I mean

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.510 
kill of it tomorrow will be I mean
kilobyte<00:02:12.590> did<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.650> say<00:02:13.800> kilobit<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> whole

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
kilobyte did I say kilobit the whole

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.220 
kilobyte did I say kilobit the whole
time<00:02:15.709> anyway<00:02:17.599> that's<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.720> first<00:02:18.900> kilobyte
