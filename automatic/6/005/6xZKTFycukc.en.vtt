so<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.010> pretty<00:00:11.190> easy<00:00:11.280> song<00:00:12.110> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so it's actually a pretty easy song to

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.709 
so it's actually a pretty easy song to
kick<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.679> pedal<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.690> on

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
kick on my pedal here we start here on

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:27.770 
kick on my pedal here we start here on
the<00:00:15.900> seventh<00:00:16.289> fret

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.869 

you

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.819 

mmm

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.660 

so<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.520> four-times<00:00:39.829> then<00:00:40.829> after<00:00:41.340> after

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so that's my four-times then after after

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
so that's my four-times then after after
you<00:00:41.970> play<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.379> G<00:00:43.710> power

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you play that then you go into a G power

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
you play that then you go into a G power
chord<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.699> you<00:00:45.390> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.290> sort<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
chord and you kind of do this sort of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.510 
chord and you kind of do this sort of
strumming<00:00:47.040> pattern

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.110 

so<00:00:52.240> I<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.480> slide<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.900> up<00:00:52.990> one

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000 

and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.050> we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> keep<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> same

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and then we're going to keep that same

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.780 
and then we're going to keep that same
power<00:00:59.370> cord<00:00:59.760> formation<00:01:00.540> but<00:01:01.410> play<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.310> in<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
power cord formation but play it in the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.090 
power cord formation but play it in the
same<00:01:03.780> sort<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.080> formation<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.800> did<00:01:04.980> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
same sort of formation that we did the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:33.220 
same sort of formation that we did the
intro<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.970> it's

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.290 

so<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.530> only<00:01:34.680> fancy<00:01:34.950> bits<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.580> are<00:01:35.820> sliding

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
so the only fancy bits there are sliding

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.200 
so the only fancy bits there are sliding
back<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:36.690> forward<00:01:37.670> which<00:01:38.670> listening<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
back and forward which listening to the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.750 
back and forward which listening to the
song<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.840> throw<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.260> there<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.220> also

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
song when to throw it in there I also

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.110 
song when to throw it in there I also
like<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> open<00:01:43.220> before<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:44.730> back<00:01:44.940> to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
like to play it open before I go back to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.830 
like to play it open before I go back to
them<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.910> I<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
them or as like I see I was on the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.820 
them or as like I see I was on the
course<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.410> what<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> but

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
course I don't know what it is but

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.880 
course I don't know what it is but
anyway

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.890 

I<00:01:53.920> think<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.850> maybe<00:01:55.090> does<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.510> when<00:01:55.630> he<00:01:55.720> plays

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
I think that maybe does it when he plays

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.840 
I think that maybe does it when he plays
it<00:01:56.110> live<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.710> like<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:57.220> because<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.610> adds<00:01:57.760> a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
it live I like it just because it adds a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.530 
it live I like it just because it adds a
bit<00:01:57.970> of<00:01:58.000> distortion<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.070> fun<00:02:00.340> anyway<00:02:00.850> that's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
bit of distortion and fun anyway that's

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.690 
bit of distortion and fun anyway that's
pretty<00:02:01.810> much<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.110> whole<00:02:02.229> song<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.040> good<00:02:03.520> luck

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
pretty much the whole song so good luck

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:17.309 
pretty much the whole song so good luck
playing<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.300> at<00:02:04.420> her

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
