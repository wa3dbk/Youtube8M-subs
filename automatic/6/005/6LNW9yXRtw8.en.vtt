00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.369
 sega like any other self-respecting 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.109
 the gaming industry has thought about 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 creating your portable gaming 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.250
 systems besides the main competitor 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 nintendo has released its version 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.230
 portable 8-bit system and even empty 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 the game console market has filled up and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.760
 the choice was already more than extensive you can 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.750
 was to find a console for almost every taste 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 development of this system began in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 1989 was originally called the console 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.059
 mercury like all consoles of the series in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 development time 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.350
 sense, not all consoles were called 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 mercury and they were called the name 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 planets like sega saturn y 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.809
 but the taboo for sega was our name 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 mother earth 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.339
 use it in their projects they don't 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 ventured sega's plans had an idea with 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.369
 using which you can overtake in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 nintendo with their gameboys 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.350
 but it will not exceed sales of gameboy 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.939
 managed by sega engineers were considered 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 many ideas and in the end they decided 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.439
 use the so-called technology 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 text message which meant by itself 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.289
 simple job of playing on game weight with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 other consoles 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.789
 developers took the game and for the shortest 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 terms altered it under serovskiy 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.259
 unit this tricky move before 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.479
 practiced in the gaming industry but in 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.609
 several large scale tags 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.560
 once already managed to overtake nintendo by 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:33.509
 technical characteristics of the era 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.350
 eight-bit systems by their sega console 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 master system 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
 but how many times the power has been said 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.579
 most importantly, many complained about the lack of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 gameboy's color screen and sega decided 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.509
 compensate for this disadvantage but in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the end they failed again 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.130
 just did a disservice 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 the console completely consumed the batteries for 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.950
 three hours, three o'clock 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.319
 the game again became expensive 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.859
 pleasure lcd monitor though became 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.210
 plus but still minus it became big 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.880
 console characteristics were approximately 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.969
 standard for that processor time 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.940
 again there were z80 bids and the number 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.020
 sprites on the screen reached 64 colors 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.920
 at the same time was 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.630
 32 screen size was three and two inches but 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.790
 yet one serious plus compared 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 with geiger gameplay was 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.780
 the console looked like a controller and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.760
 gamer's hands were easy 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.160
 manage the device that you can not 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.900
 was to say about geymboe despite 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.209
 Szego weakness in relation to nintendo 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.230
 game divide existed for a long time 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.390
 up until 1997 7 years for 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.510
 portable console term is very long 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.760
 even nintendo and then win game gear 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.799
 also suffered due to the lack of hits in 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 the same nintendo for example was mario 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.260
 which automatically made the game good 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.970
 in myself too there is such a heroic but 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 sonic didnâ€™t get so big 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.890
 as mario and many simply did not trust 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.310
 he is also able to sega for so long 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.410
 lived 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.720
 because of its huge amount very 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.819
 useful expansion modules thanks 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.519
 which geiger functionality significantly 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.319
 expansion modules expanded of course 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.470
 inserted into the cartridge compartment 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.030
 let's go in order I 'll start with the battery 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.260
 which finally solved the problem 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.390
 color consoles 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.819
 thanks to this battery play 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.930
 it was completely free to pay 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.900
 needed only for electricity 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.760
 total battery charge 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.970
 charging time was about 8 hours 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.739
 quite a long time but thanks to that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.170
 the battery lasted for 4 hours 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.180
 continuous game many gamers were 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.739
 glad you don't have to buy every time 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.350
 In the battery store to normal 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.260
 play but the battery had two huge 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.329
 minus and is it too big and 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.389
 great weight she was just awesome 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.430
 as many as 400 grams what they thought about 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.980
 creating a battery of this size for 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.900
 portable console what kind of person 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.299
 sound mind will be a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.400
 the monster is only on the road can the battery 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.190
 play a positive role and build is 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 our was a more useful player show store 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.750
 and bought a lens that increased 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.880
 game screen 5 inches 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.690
 useful for many games but again 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.880
 big size 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.800
 badly affected sales the next 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.480
 the gadget is essentially just an adapter 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.550
 which allows you to play all the game 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.960
 gear just at home by connecting the system in 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.630
 the network then went out 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.670
 master gear converter many probably 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.950
 guess from the name that the game 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.980
 gear god run games from another system 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.080
 that's just what of course this master 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.940
 system device worked like 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.590
 ok but there were still some 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.810
 pitfalls that prevented 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.000
 The normal operation of the console was still 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.010
 Pretty controversial accessories game genius 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.590
 who allowed with his help fight 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.200
 take away all possible codes on life or 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.240
 other pleasures of the game of life most 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.860
 a cool example of improving gadget 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.390
 the console has become you because we have 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.030
 of course played movies on 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.750
 poor game weights were versions for different 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.880
 regions 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.370
 for european and asian and so 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.480
 then the batteries died quickly when 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.250
 using the tuner 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.200
 but the lucky ones who still had 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.810
 batteries could be quite long 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.760
 enjoy watching the film engineers 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.190
 sega and of course there have been some 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.800
 screw up the fact is that later 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.610
 Console versions have changed the layout in 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.530
 resulting in 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.630
 the tuner simply did not respond to 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.270
 interaction with the console for many 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.890
 users this was a tragedy 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.610
 Of course, this is not all gadgets for 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.950
 gamer 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.110
 but perhaps they are the most important because 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.140
 the rest is network play 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.330
 protective covers and other trash so what 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.669
 we got and we got pretty 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.980
 a good defense gaming system 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.690
 characteristics of their competitors but not 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.350
 overtaking sales chief 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.380
 competitor 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.940
 nintendo life cycle was long and beyond 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.280
 the time of the consoles is out 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.940
 a lot of games but for the complete victory of this 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.919
 there were few 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.450
 possible if the batteries already 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.780
 installed in each console 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.270
 game gear became more popular than gameboy and me 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.400
 it seems so, but unfortunately it 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.530
 there was another time if in europe and 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.380
 America console somehow perceived 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.750
 then in Asia they did not want to hear a word 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.540
 with you was perpetuum mobile
