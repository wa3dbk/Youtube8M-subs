00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.200 

so<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:01.199> recently<00:00:01.800> got<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> little<00:00:02.669> bit<00:00:02.850> into

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so I recently got a little bit into

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.809 
so I recently got a little bit into
x-wing<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.140> these<00:00:04.380> older<00:00:04.710> ships<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.130> got<00:00:05.370> so

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
x-wing and these older ships I got so

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.470 
x-wing and these older ships I got so
far<00:00:06.210> not<00:00:06.870> really<00:00:07.140> organized<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.480> figured

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
far not really organized here I figured

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.850 
far not really organized here I figured
I<00:00:09.570> wanted<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.960> go<00:00:10.110> x-wings

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
I wanted to go x-wings

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.580 
I wanted to go x-wings
but<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.639> been<00:00:12.360> watching<00:00:12.690> x-wing<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.110> YouTube

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
but I been watching x-wing and YouTube

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.730 
but I been watching x-wing and YouTube
for<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> while<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.309> saw<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> few<00:00:15.389> modes<00:00:15.710> but<00:00:16.710> I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
for a while and I saw a few modes but I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.060 
for a while and I saw a few modes but I
haven't<00:00:17.039> seen<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.490> model<00:00:17.940> before<00:00:18.060> which<00:00:18.570> was

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
haven't seen this model before which was

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
haven't seen this model before which was
my<00:00:20.070> first<00:00:20.310> mode<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.000> did<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> couple<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.689> days

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
my first mode I did it a couple of days

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.540 
my first mode I did it a couple of days
back

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
back

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.800 
back
it's<00:00:24.769> a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.609> into<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> engine<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's a little put into the engine on the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
it's a little put into the engine on the
Thai<00:00:28.519> defender<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> Thai<00:00:31.260> defender<00:00:31.710> was

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
Thai defender the Thai defender was

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.299 
Thai defender the Thai defender was
really<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:33.050> favorite<00:00:34.050> chips<00:00:34.320> back<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
really one of my favorite chips back in

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
really one of my favorite chips back in
the<00:00:35.579> days<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.329> played<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.930> fighter<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the days when I played a fighter and I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.830 
the days when I played a fighter and I
really<00:00:40.050> can't<00:00:40.320> show<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.390> sadly<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.540> can't

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
really can't show how it sadly I can't

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.459 
really can't show how it sadly I can't
show<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.620> looked<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:45.469> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
show how it really looked because the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
show how it really looked because the
camera<00:00:46.920> can't<00:00:47.190> pick<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.000> more<00:00:48.300> like

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
camera can't pick it up it's more like

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.319 
camera can't pick it up it's more like
this<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.460> detail<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this but you can see the detail from the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.490 
this but you can see the detail from the
inside<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> engine

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
inside of the engine

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.750 
inside of the engine
I<00:00:56.270> run<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> couple<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.170> years<00:00:59.180> I<00:01:01.520> mean<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> can

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
I run a couple of I years I mean you can

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.590 
I run a couple of I years I mean you can
hardly<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.700> might<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.210> able<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
hardly see them so might not be able to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.060 
hardly see them so might not be able to
get<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> focus<00:01:09.170> on<00:01:10.170> them<00:01:12.470> it's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> bit<00:01:13.680> hard<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
get the focus on them it's a bit hard to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.870 
get the focus on them it's a bit hard to
see<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.930> actually<00:01:16.850> they<00:01:17.850> are

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
see where they are actually they are

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.289 
see where they are actually they are
very<00:01:18.869> thin<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.470> I've<00:01:19.890> run<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.430> down<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
very thin and I've run them down the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.230 
very thin and I've run them down the
battery<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> bottom<00:01:23.850> side<00:01:26.240> good

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
battery here on the bottom side good

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
battery here on the bottom side good
part<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.369> diode<00:01:29.790> only<00:01:29.939> takes<00:01:30.590> as

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
part is that the diode only takes as

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.460 
part is that the diode only takes as
much<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.460> wants<00:01:32.960> should<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
much as it wants should not need a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
much as it wants should not need a
resistor<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:36.680> if<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> breaks<00:01:38.070> okay<00:01:39.030> I'll

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
resistor for this if it breaks okay I'll

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.140 
resistor for this if it breaks okay I'll
have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> replace<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.549> did<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
have to replace it I did it so that I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
have to replace it I did it so that I
can<00:01:42.390> remove<00:01:42.899> them<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.040> diode<00:01:44.549> pretty<00:01:44.970> easily

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
can remove them the diode pretty easily

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
can remove them the diode pretty easily
and<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.869> damaging<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.970> sheep<00:01:48.740> there<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and not damaging the sheep there is the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.539 
and not damaging the sheep there is the
wire

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.389 

here<00:01:54.500> very<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.710> thin<00:01:56.399> wire<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:59.159> was

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
here very very thin wire and it was

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.460 
here very very thin wire and it was
pretty<00:01:59.549> hard

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.630 

but<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.120> fun<00:02:04.300> project<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:06.070> adds<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.520> little

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
but it's a fun project it adds a little

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.100 
but it's a fun project it adds a little
bit<00:02:06.790> more<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:08.759> guess<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:09.940> not<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:10.390> realism

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
bit more I guess it's not really realism

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.570 
bit more I guess it's not really realism
but<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.380> makes<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.800> little<00:02:11.920> bit<00:02:12.130> colder

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
but it makes it a little bit colder

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.470 
but it makes it a little bit colder
that's<00:02:13.300> my<00:02:13.510> opinion<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:15.190> that's<00:02:15.550> my<00:02:15.730> multi

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
that's my opinion there that's my multi

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.790 
that's my opinion there that's my multi
defender<00:02:17.020> hope<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.350> like<00:02:17.530> it
