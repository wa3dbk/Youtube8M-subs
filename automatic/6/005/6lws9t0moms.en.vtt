00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
think one of the things about jungle

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.740 
think one of the things about jungle
that<00:06:01.160> makes<00:06:01.340> it<00:06:01.520> unique<00:06:01.820> is<00:06:02.030> that<00:06:02.090> it<00:06:02.600> has

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
that makes it unique is that it has

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.330 
that makes it unique is that it has
quite<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:03.050> bit<00:06:03.200> of<00:06:03.290> verticality<00:06:03.650> there's<00:06:04.070> a<00:06:04.130> lot

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
quite a bit of verticality there's a lot

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.640 
quite a bit of verticality there's a lot
of<00:06:04.370> gameplay<00:06:04.850> at<00:06:05.330> various<00:06:05.900> different<00:06:06.110> levels

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
of gameplay at various different levels

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.040 
of gameplay at various different levels
so<00:06:06.860> at<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.550> riverbed<00:06:07.940> level<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.720> know<00:06:08.840> that's

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
so at the riverbed level you know that's

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.630 
so at the riverbed level you know that's
one<00:06:09.290> level<00:06:09.500> then<00:06:09.920> there's<00:06:10.100> different<00:06:10.610> levels

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
one level then there's different levels

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.030 
one level then there's different levels
and<00:06:11.120> perches<00:06:11.630> all<00:06:12.020> that<00:06:12.170> verticality<00:06:12.560> plays

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
and perches all that verticality plays

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.800 
and perches all that verticality plays
