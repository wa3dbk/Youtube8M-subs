it will match perfect in this corner

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
it will match perfect in this corner
against<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> blackboard<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
against the blackboard and so this is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.390 
against the blackboard and so this is
what<00:01:29.700> coming<00:01:30.119> what's<00:01:30.780> coming<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.259> home<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.250> a

understand<00:02:51.840> these<00:02:52.620> are<00:02:52.890> not<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:54.030> round<00:02:54.900> glass

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
understand these are not a round glass

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.479 
understand these are not a round glass
these<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.799> not<00:02:55.950> bowls<00:02:56.329> because<00:02:57.329> they<00:02:57.900> are

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
these are not bowls because they are

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.569 
these are not bowls because they are
only<00:02:59.489> round<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.319> board<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
only round in the in the board here and

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.199 
only round in the in the board here and
then<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.780> glass<00:03:04.290> are<00:03:04.530> flat<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:06.030> are

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
then the glass are flat so they are

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.910 
then the glass are flat so they are
mm-hmm<00:03:07.200> pretty<00:03:08.010> pretty<00:03:09.109> look<00:03:10.109> alike<00:03:10.379> this<00:03:10.709> one

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
mm-hmm pretty pretty look alike this one

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.430 
mm-hmm pretty pretty look alike this one
but<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.609> board<00:03:11.879> here<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.319> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
but with a board here and there and the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.750 
but with a board here and there and the
board<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.799> round<00:03:14.129> instead<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:17.419> quadrant<00:03:18.620> so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
board is round instead of a quadrant so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.659 
board is round instead of a quadrant so
this<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.630> bendy<00:03:22.319> glass<00:03:22.560> has<00:03:22.889> been<00:03:22.919> bent

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
this is not a bendy glass has been bent

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.479 
this is not a bendy glass has been bent
glass<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.329> not<00:03:24.810> good<00:03:25.139> for<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.349> betta<00:03:25.620> fish<00:03:25.709> they

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
glass is not good for a betta fish they

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.370 
glass is not good for a betta fish they
get<00:03:27.859> swim<00:03:28.859> bladder<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:30.150> swim<00:03:30.359> bladder<00:03:30.630> can't

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
get swim bladder this swim bladder can't

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.879 
get swim bladder this swim bladder can't
handle<00:03:31.950> their<00:03:32.160> bent<00:03:32.790> glass<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.680> they<00:03:34.680> will

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
handle their bent glass so they will

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.140 
handle their bent glass so they will
feel<00:03:35.579> pretty<00:03:36.079> bad<00:03:37.079> if<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.889> put<00:03:38.700> them<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
feel pretty bad if you put them in the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.789 
feel pretty bad if you put them in the
bowls<00:03:40.549> with<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.609> round<00:03:42.060> glass<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.049> that's<00:03:43.349> not

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
bowls with a round glass so that's not

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.559 
bowls with a round glass so that's not
good<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> betta<00:03:44.430> fish<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.389> why<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
good for a betta fish so that's why I

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.349 
good for a betta fish so that's why I
got<00:03:46.010> stuck<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.280> tank<00:03:47.609> because<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
got stuck for this tank because the

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:55.699 
got stuck for this tank because the
glass<00:03:48.690> was<00:03:48.900> um<00:03:50.030> flat<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:52.430> um<00:03:54.319> don't<00:03:55.319> need<00:03:55.500> to

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
glass was um flat and I um don't need to

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.440 
glass was um flat and I um don't need to
have<00:03:55.919> plastic<00:03:56.579> anymore

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
have plastic anymore

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.839 
have plastic anymore
this<00:03:57.930> plastic<00:03:58.169> is<00:03:58.470> good<00:03:58.799> when<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.310> have<00:03:59.340> to

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
this plastic is good when you have to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.800 
this plastic is good when you have to
clean<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.239> tank<00:04:00.540> but<00:04:01.579> it's<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.790> guts<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.269> gets<00:04:03.629> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
clean a tank but it's a guts it gets the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.339 
clean a tank but it's a guts it gets the
ripped<00:04:04.079> very<00:04:04.829> easily<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:06.150> it's<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.599> already

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
ripped very easily so it's it already

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.949 
ripped very easily so it's it already
was<00:04:07.650> rich<00:04:08.069> when<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.489> got<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.389> shows

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
was rich when I got it and that shows

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.250 
was rich when I got it and that shows
how<00:04:10.260> bad<00:04:10.530> quality<00:04:10.949> it<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.449> so<00:04:12.449> this<00:04:12.629> is<00:04:12.810> pure

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
how bad quality it is so this is pure

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.460 
how bad quality it is so this is pure
glass<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.609> really<00:04:14.910> loved<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.299> pea<00:04:16.139> plant

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
glass and I really loved a pea plant

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.250 
glass and I really loved a pea plant
it's<00:04:17.010> very<00:04:17.549> soft<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.510> knows<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.079> in

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
it's very soft it knows it's not in

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.540 
it's very soft it knows it's not in
plastic<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.919> soft<00:04:20.760> synthetic<00:04:21.419> synthetic<00:04:22.550> so

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
plastic it's soft synthetic synthetic so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.590 
plastic it's soft synthetic synthetic so
and<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.180> goes<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.930> up<00:04:25.140> to<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.560> air<00:04:26.180> surface

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
and it goes right up to the air surface

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.890 
and it goes right up to the air surface
so<00:04:28.380> this<00:04:28.590> will<00:04:28.920> be<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> little<00:04:29.660> exciting<00:04:30.660> to

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
so this will be a little exciting to

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
so this will be a little exciting to
have<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.440> tank<00:04:31.890> over<00:04:32.580> here<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.630> an<00:04:34.350> extra

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
have this tank over here and an extra

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.050 
have this tank over here and an extra
thing<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:36.360> tank<00:04:36.750> has<00:04:37.230> both<00:04:37.800> light<00:04:38.220> daylight

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
thing this tank has both light daylight

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.830 
thing this tank has both light daylight
and<00:04:39.740> moon<00:04:40.740> vision<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.970> moon<00:04:42.120> mission<00:04:42.540> is

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
and moon vision and the moon mission is

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.220 
and moon vision and the moon mission is
them<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:45.150> in<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.420> lamp<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:47.960> looks<00:04:48.960> like

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
them I think in the lamp that looks like

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.790 
them I think in the lamp that looks like
the<00:04:49.410> moon's<00:04:50.120> effect<00:04:51.120> on<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:52.050> surface<00:04:52.560> at

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
the moon's effect on the surface at

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.130 
the moon's effect on the surface at
night<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.970> will<00:04:54.120> look<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.930> moon

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
night so it will look like the moon

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.120 
night so it will look like the moon
shining<00:04:55.680> about<00:04:56.220> by<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.760> tank<00:04:57.470> at<00:04:58.470> night<00:04:58.740> and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
shining about by the tank at night and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.670 
shining about by the tank at night and
that's<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.670> really<00:05:00.180> really<00:05:00.630> natural<00:05:01.050> for<00:05:01.620> a

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
that's a really really natural for a

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.820 
that's a really really natural for a
betta<00:05:01.860> fish<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:03.360> real<00:05:03.660> life<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.200> I've<00:05:05.210> known

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
betta fish in real life and I've known

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.740 
betta fish in real life and I've known
very<00:05:07.830> few<00:05:08.310> tanks<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:08.850> have<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.480> moon

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
very few tanks that have this moon

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.350 
very few tanks that have this moon
mission<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:11.040> I'm<00:05:11.100> really<00:05:11.310> glad<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.820> one<00:05:12.150> have

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.320 
it and this is my this is how it looks
when<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.940> fish<00:05:18.720> is<00:05:18.870> in<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.430> it's<00:05:20.430> yeah

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
when the fish is in and it's yeah

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.790 
when the fish is in and it's yeah
exactly<00:05:21.900> big<00:05:22.560> s<00:05:22.950> big<00:05:23.160> s<00:05:23.220> these<00:05:23.940> are<00:05:24.440> ten<00:05:25.440> liters

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800

ten liters so just how it will look like

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.780 
ten liters so just how it will look like
when<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:31.050> setup<00:05:31.350> whole<00:05:31.830> setup<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.550> the
