uranium mine there's an awful lot of
cancer<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.579> found<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:33.090> how

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
cancer then we found out how

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.840 
cancer then we found out how
far-reaching<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.320> problem<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.980> everything

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
far-reaching the problem is everything

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.020

changed<00:00:36.590> what<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> causing<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.489> cancer

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
changed what is causing all this cancer

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.780 
changed what is causing all this cancer
is<00:00:39.140> uranium<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> water<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.640> my

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is uranium in the water I know what my

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.290 
is uranium in the water I know what my
dad's<00:00:42.030> spicket<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.260> hot<00:00:43.670> we've<00:00:44.670> lost<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.149> many

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
dad's spicket is hot we've lost so many

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.840 
dad's spicket is hot we've lost so many
up<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.690> down<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> creek<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.440> cancer<00:00:46.950> but

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
up and down a creek with cancer but

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.210 
up and down a creek with cancer but
that's<00:00:48.079> tough

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
that's tough

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.850 
that's tough
even<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.060> to<00:00:51.210> 50<00:00:51.540> years<00:00:51.720> ago<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.200> people<00:00:52.650> could

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
even up to 50 years ago I people could

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.550 
even up to 50 years ago I people could
drink<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.790> water<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.750> can't<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
drink that water and now they can't and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.320 
drink that water and now they can't and
it's<00:00:55.740> from<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.340> abandoned<00:00:56.850> uranium

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
it's from all these abandoned uranium

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.210 
it's from all these abandoned uranium
mines<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:58.200> have<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.470> acknowledge<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
mines people have to acknowledge that

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.560 
mines people have to acknowledge that
there's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.610> strong<00:00:59.850> possibility<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there's a strong possibility that

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
there's a strong possibility that
uranium<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.470> getting<00:01:01.860> into<00:01:02.070> underground

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
uranium is getting into underground

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.939 
uranium is getting into underground

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
ways there any of mining industry can

ways there any of mining industry can
yet<00:01:12.840> continues<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.590> say<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.190> safe<00:01:14.520> it's

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
yet continues to say it's safe it's

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.690 
yet continues to say it's safe it's
because<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.170> difficult<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.770> prove<00:01:17.190> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
because it's very difficult to prove the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
because it's very difficult to prove the
realities<00:01:18.120> you're<00:01:18.270> changing<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.780> whole

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
realities you're changing the whole

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
realities you're changing the whole
geochemistry<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> aquifer<00:01:20.760> when<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.660> do

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
geochemistry of that aquifer when you do

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.540 
geochemistry of that aquifer when you do
that<00:01:21.960> mining<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> bring<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
that mining and so to bring that

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.700 
that mining and so to bring that
elevated<00:01:24.210> concentration<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.470> to

impossible to do when we started filming

impossible to do when we started filming
we<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:31.050> just<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> a
