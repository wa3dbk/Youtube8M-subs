00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.509
 that you will be all welcome to not have 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.839
 everything a little today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.809
 show 7 different hairstyles that can 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.599
 use during the whole week of Monday to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.820
 Sunday these hairstyles are super 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.710
 simple and do not require a lot of time 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.680
 so if they want to learn how to do 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.960
 these hairstyles keep watching this video 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.930
 for the first hairstyle they will grab a 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.740
 half tail and they will tie it with a 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.660
 list and what follows is super easy I know 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.810
 that are going to loosen the average little 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.690
 tail and what they are going to do is they are going to 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.690
 put the tail in 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.380
 and that's how we should look 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 the league but if you like to cover 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.790
 with a bow tie or a little flower you can 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 do I'm going to put a black bow 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.360
 because it 's the only thing I found and so I 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.360
 stay 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 for this second hairstyle I will pick up 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 my hair in a tail 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.020
 and what I 'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 select a little piece of hair and I'll 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 to make a braid let's make a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.940
 braid very well tight and everything and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.850
 Check that the braid is going to be rolled 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.480
 the tail is very simple the truth 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.660
 but in the end the result is very very 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.660
 all right 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.130
 for this next hairstyle you will need 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.440
 We're going to cut it off from a sock 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 puntita and what we are going to do is that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.570
 let's screw it up or let's do the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 sock like a league 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.330
 let's pick up our hair in a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.330
 tail 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.600
 and we are going to place the pretty one or the 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.240
 sock in the tail and we will cover it 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.630
 very good since we cover it we are going to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.500
 place a league 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.400
 and as last we are going to hide the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.530
 hair that we have left and we're going to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.250
 grab with a pin and that's how 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.250
 the cholito was 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.780
 for this next hairstyle we are going to do 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.329
 the same as in the first hairstyle but 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.349
 It's different, we're going to screw it in very well 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.560
 the hair and we are going to place a clip or 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.540
 a baby pin the pin 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.340
 and then we're going to do it across the way 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.930
 and you can choose what you 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.420
 like after we're going to grab a 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.090
 tail 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.819
 and that 's the part where it's like the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.000
 first hairstyle let's put the tail 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.370
 inside and we will have something like that 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 This hairstyle is very simple because 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.250
 basically they are going to be just two braids 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.830
 on each side and they will grab or 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.900
 secure with a pin and this I say this 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.450
 It is very simple but it is something in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.700
 in front of this next hairstyle is a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.680
 little ice cream changer and the first thing 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.810
 we're going to do is we 're going to make a 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 normal braid either on the right side or 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.070
 left and we're going to loosen it a little 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.470
 then we are going to screw the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.850
 braid in a changuito and with a league what 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.850
 let's make sure 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.150
 for this last hairstyle what are going to 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.180
 to do is that they are going to make a braid and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.319
 either on the right or left side go 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.319
 to do very well 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.770
 and then we're going to grab a half tail 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.990
 and we are going to screw the tail 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.150
 we do it like chulito 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.570
 and we will ensure it very well with a 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.570
 Barrette 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.290
 then we are going to take the rest of the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.599
 hair and let's make a braid 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.329
 and we're going to basically do the same thing 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.000
 braid we are going to screw it as part 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.900
 to be part of the chongo and also 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.550
 the braid we made from the beginning 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.250
 we ensure everything very well with the pin 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.229
 and that's how we should stay 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.370
