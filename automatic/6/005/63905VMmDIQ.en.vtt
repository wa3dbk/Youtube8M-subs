00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.820
 in four days to decorate his assets and 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.350
 although they are very easy and I am also going to 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.939
 show them some decorations that I've 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.180
 done earlier to give them more 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 ideas 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 in time we do 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.180
 to make this crazy vase we need 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.309
 Disposable cups we can also use 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.559
 small pots with sticks and a 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 pot is mainly what we are going to 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 need 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.260
 The first thing we will do is paint the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.260
 glasses of the color that we like 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 now let's prepare the base that is what 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.860
 more important is the stick of pot 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.860
 and the suture with two stones 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.800
 and we're going to fill in with earth though 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.870
 you can also use it and it's all 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.890
 what you want we are going to put a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.890
 for one of this way 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.320
 we're going to fill in dirt now too 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.570
 well this vase can use it as 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 pot and put plants really but if 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.160
 you can not make this simple little flowers 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.330
 with crepe paper and they are super easy 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.070
 we will cut the paper in this way and 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.070
 let's give it by half petals 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.290
 to the shore should not be like that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.970
 we put plastic around the edge 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.010
 we put a wire appointment on the tip and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.670
 we started looking for him wrinkling a little 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.670
 each petal 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.710
 this is what was going to shape it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710
 little flower 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.920
 and so we should stay 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.840
 disconnect a stone that contains a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.030
 phrase written and ready 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.810
 shows ideas that are decorative 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.909
 inspiring awaits a class that will 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.710
 like in the middle of a sheet that has the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.899
 same size as the glass of our 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.000
 portal or stratum and print we have phrases 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.009
 of songs or poems that prevent us and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 we like this case play with your 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.179
 nice comments we are going to paste these 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.959
 pieces of paper around the sentences 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.959
 main 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.760
 in the interesting part we will put the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.410
 portrait porta glass above and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.920
 we will leave some loose pieces of paper 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 about him 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.000
 and put a contact paper so that they remain 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.000
 adhered 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.480
 we simply put it together and it must throw us 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.180
 with this 3d effect 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.629
 and certainly the best is inspiring and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.629
 the truth 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.870
 this idea is mostly fast we are going to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.900
 need a fish tank or container 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.330
 glass like this we will put inside one of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.060
 these lights that work with batteries 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.590
 although it is optional we put everything tape 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.590
 baby or crepe paper inside 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.390
 and we will put little flowers what I like 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.250
 that almost all materials can 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.250
 change them for others that if we have them 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.290
 and finally we are going to make a nice 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.940
 hanging for the wall using the same 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.190
 funds and flowers that we use at 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.110
 principle we will think our cries to 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.110
 The glasses help me with a screw 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.490
 we look for two points where we can 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.410
 hang it high plus the thread of a point 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.410
 we had it for each cup 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.810
 we are again now we are going to be able 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.810
 put what we want inside 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.450
 something similar with this picture i what 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.450
 I hung them with these baby brooches 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.970
 and now I'm going to show you some 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.010
 curiosities of my room for 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.450
 give them some ideas plus the color of your 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.159
 curtains can change a lot 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.900
 room and time that are super 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.549
 Easy to make, I bought them 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.329
 called folder that is very cheap 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.329
 very beautiful entity 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.040
 this decoration that you have seen in 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.620
 other videos is simply poster paper 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.390
 stuck with tape to the wall and if I drew 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.490
 one by one the squares with marker 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.010
 Black can think of another design than a 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.660
 you like it and do the same 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.040
 mini table that I have on the floor says 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.140
 cutting half a platform that 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.900
 I found him I put a wooden base 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.300
 over and paint 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.949
 as a mini-scenario let's say these 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.160
 furniture the best with acrylic paint 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.630
 and I told them taxis with black marker is 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.419
 the same thing that I did with the frame of my 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.190
 mirrors and ready 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.110
