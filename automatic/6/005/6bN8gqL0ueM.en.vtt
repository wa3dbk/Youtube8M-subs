00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
kind of wanted to go over the reasoning

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.529 
kind of wanted to go over the reasoning
why<00:00:22.949> chose<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> ballistic<00:00:23.820> nylon<00:00:23.970> sheath<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
why chose the ballistic nylon sheath and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.599 
why chose the ballistic nylon sheath and
what<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> personally<00:00:25.710> carry<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> inside<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
what I personally carry on the inside of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
what I personally carry on the inside of
it<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> might<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.109> similarities

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it so you might see some similarities

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.460 
it so you might see some similarities
some<00:00:29.070> differences<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
some differences but pretty much the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
some differences but pretty much the
main<00:00:31.650> points<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.340> covered<00:00:32.640> right

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
main points are gonna be covered right

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.520 
main points are gonna be covered right
now<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.210> carrying<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.600> knife<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> left

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
now I'm carrying my knife on the left

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
now I'm carrying my knife on the left
side<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.800> body<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> right

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
side of my body because on the right

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
side of my body because on the right
side<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.079> pistol<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.100> inside<00:00:39.059> this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
side I have a pistol so inside this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
side I have a pistol so inside this
pocket<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.170> thing<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pocket the first thing that I have is a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
pocket the first thing that I have is a
small<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.420> dangling<00:00:43.170> piece<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> 550<00:00:43.950> cord

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
small little dangling piece of 550 cord

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
small little dangling piece of 550 cord
and<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.940> reason<00:00:45.210> why<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> dangling

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and the reason why I have it dangling

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.650 
and the reason why I have it dangling
out<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.680> attach<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.420> really

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
out is because attach to it if I really

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830 
out is because attach to it if I really
need<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.100> are<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.399> essentials<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.629> first

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
need to are some essentials the first

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
need to are some essentials the first
being<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.350> signal<00:00:52.920> whistles<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.270> what

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
being a signal whistles and this is what

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
being a signal whistles and this is what
comes<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:54.989> much<00:00:55.170> any<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.410> knives

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
comes with pretty much any other knives

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
comes with pretty much any other knives
they<00:00:56.579> work<00:00:56.760> great<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:58.039> p38<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.870> opener

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
they work great I think a p38 can opener

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
they work great I think a p38 can opener
this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:02.190> small<00:01:02.460> compact<00:01:02.969> easy<00:01:03.660> way

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this is a really small compact easy way

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
this is a really small compact easy way
to<00:01:03.989> open<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.290> cans<00:01:04.619> without<00:01:04.890> having<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to open up cans without having to use a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.649 
to open up cans without having to use a
blade<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.700> potentially<00:01:06.119> doing<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.540> edge

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
blade and potentially doing your edge

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
blade and potentially doing your edge
and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> Topps<00:01:08.460> knife<00:01:08.760> fire

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
starter which has a fro cm rod and then

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.700 
starter which has a fro cm rod and then
two<00:01:11.760> magnesium<00:01:12.299> rods<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> wet

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
two magnesium rods so if it's in a wet

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
two magnesium rods so if it's in a wet
condition<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.520> ahead<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.880> shave<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.360> pile<00:01:15.659> of

you have a little nick a small flat spot

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.980 
you have a little nick a small flat spot
that<00:01:51.390> you

that you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.620 
that you
-<00:01:52.140> even<00:01:52.620> now<00:01:52.650> go<00:01:53.370> ahead<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.670> use<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> four<00:01:54.540> on

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
- even now go ahead and use a four on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
- even now go ahead and use a four on
decide<00:01:54.900> which<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.229> cut<00:01:55.440> through<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.860> fast

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
decide which will cut through the fast

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
decide which will cut through the fast
and<00:01:56.400> cleanly<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.940> then<00:01:57.930> smooth<00:01:58.350> everything

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and cleanly and then smooth everything

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.790 
and cleanly and then smooth everything
out<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> 1200<00:02:00.390> grit<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.650> is

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
out with the 1200 grit and so this is

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.830 
out with the 1200 grit and so this is
the<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.280> sharpening<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.000> 95%<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the the sharpening that I use 95% of the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350 
the the sharpening that I use 95% of the
time<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.320> other<00:02:04.590> 5%<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.759> I'll<00:02:06.150> have<00:02:06.300> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
time the other 5% you know I'll have a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479 
time the other 5% you know I'll have a
ceramic<00:02:06.690> with<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.250> get

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
ceramic with me so that I can really get

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
ceramic with me so that I can really get
a<00:02:08.520> mere<00:02:08.729> polish<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.270> blade<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.020> way<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
a mere polish on the blade that way I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.220 
a mere polish on the blade that way I
have<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.709> least<00:02:10.890> amount<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.190> friction<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
have the least amount of friction and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.910 
have the least amount of friction and
it'll<00:02:13.230> last<00:02:13.380> longer

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it'll last longer

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.870 
it'll last longer
and<00:02:14.130> then<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.580> cut<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> lot<00:02:15.000> cleaner<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:16.880> then

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and then just cut a lot cleaner and then

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.110 
and then just cut a lot cleaner and then
I<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.600> small<00:02:19.020> length<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.739> 550<00:02:20.640> cord<00:02:20.819> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
I have a small length of 550 cord and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.270 
I have a small length of 550 cord and
what<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> use<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> small<00:02:23.010> knot<00:02:23.190> at

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
what I use this I have a small knot at

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
what I use this I have a small knot at
the<00:02:23.340> end<00:02:23.550> but<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.690> enough<00:02:25.080> cordage<00:02:25.769> for

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the end but this is enough cordage for

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.560 
the end but this is enough cordage for
me<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.250> lash<00:02:26.459> my<00:02:26.790> knife<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.300> end<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
me to lash my knife to the end of the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.070 
me to lash my knife to the end of the
stick<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.989> make<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.530> spear<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:30.180> don't

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
stick to make a spear and I don't

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020 
stick to make a spear and I don't
suggest<00:02:31.320> doing<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:32.670> hunting

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
suggest doing that you know for hunting

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
suggest doing that you know for hunting
unless<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> really<00:02:33.900> last-ditch<00:02:34.800> resort

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
unless it's a really last-ditch resort

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.530 
unless it's a really last-ditch resort
and<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.459> really<00:02:35.790> need<00:02:35.940> something<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.330> help

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and you really need something to help

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.380 
and you really need something to help
you<00:02:36.660> out<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.440> pretty<00:02:37.680> much<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:39.209> other

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you out but pretty much the other

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.170 
you out but pretty much the other
purpose<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.280> am<00:02:41.580> short<00:02:41.880> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
purpose for that is because I am short I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.600 
purpose for that is because I am short I
don't<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:42.900> high<00:02:43.200> reach<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.459> I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
don't have a very high reach so if I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.080 
don't have a very high reach so if I
need<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.980> some<00:02:46.980> some<00:02:47.580> fruit<00:02:47.820> out<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
need to get some some fruit out of a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.690 
need to get some some fruit out of a
tree<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:49.110> pretty<00:02:49.620> much<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.580> an

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
tree I can pretty much have that as an

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.729 
tree I can pretty much have that as an
extension<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.209> body<00:02:51.239> cut<00:02:52.110> down<00:02:52.290> apples

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
extension of my body cut down apples

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.009 
extension of my body cut down apples
oranges<00:02:53.269> what-have-you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
oranges what-have-you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.270 
oranges what-have-you
so<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.650> really<00:02:55.830> important<00:02:56.190> especially

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
so that's really important especially
