00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
game this is a hundred and one with a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240 
game this is a hundred and one with a
pretty<00:00:11.670> clutch<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.360> guess<00:00:12.630> final<00:00:13.530> two<00:00:13.679> kills<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
pretty clutch I guess final two kills to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.820 
pretty clutch I guess final two kills to
secure<00:00:14.700> me<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.929> hundred<00:00:15.929> Katie<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
secure me the hundred Katie I think the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.900 
secure me the hundred Katie I think the
game<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> little<00:00:17.340> bit<00:00:17.430> shorter<00:00:17.550> thing<00:00:17.789> goes

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
game was a little bit shorter thing goes

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.939 
game was a little bit shorter thing goes
like<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.539> ended<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.020> score<00:00:19.560> line<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
like then ended up the score line and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
like then ended up the score line and
being<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.250> 200<00:00:20.789> 240<00:00:21.270> something<00:00:21.689> so

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
being like 200 240 something so

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.080 
being like 200 240 something so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of I know kind of funny but anyways

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
of I know kind of funny but anyways
using<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> same<00:00:36.809> setup<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.559> pretty

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
using the same setup as I was pretty

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
using the same setup as I was pretty
much<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> same<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> last<00:00:39.300> video<00:00:39.950> PDW

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
much in the same in the last video PDW

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
much in the same in the last video PDW
with<00:00:41.879> silencer<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.390> laser<00:00:42.690> sight<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.079> i

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
with silencer and laser sight but i

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.690 
with silencer and laser sight but i
think<00:00:43.320> i<00:00:43.379> switched<00:00:43.710> fast<00:00:44.040> mags<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.489> with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
think i switched fast mags out with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
think i switched fast mags out with
extended<00:00:45.390> mags<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:45.989> someone<00:00:46.320> actually

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
extended mags because someone actually

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
extended mags because someone actually
posts<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> comments<00:00:47.309> saying<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.210> know

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
posts in the comments saying you know

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
posts in the comments saying you know
extended<00:00:49.170> mags<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.770> probably<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.160> better

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
extended mags would probably be better

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
extended mags would probably be better

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
but at this time I'm at think 12,000

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.860 
but at this time I'm at think 12,000
almost<00:02:30.750> 500<00:02:31.319> that's<00:02:31.950> pretty<00:02:32.549> much<00:02:32.640> 2,600<00:02:33.599> subs

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
such a short amount of time which is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
such a short amount of time which is
