00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
damage so he's not gonna die at all i

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.080 
damage so he's not gonna die at all i
think<00:00:46.550> in<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.239> duration<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.660> this<00:00:47.809> video<00:00:48.110> and

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
think in the duration of this video and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.869 
think in the duration of this video and
i<00:00:50.440> also<00:00:51.440> don't<00:00:51.739> think<00:00:51.920> my<00:00:52.010> archery<00:00:52.399> increases

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
i also don't think my archery increases

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.610 
i also don't think my archery increases
again<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.780> did<00:00:53.930> at<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.140> beginning<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:54.500> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
again but it did at the beginning of the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.310 
again but it did at the beginning of the
video<00:00:54.789> but<00:00:55.789> that's<00:00:55.940> only<00:00:56.210> because<00:00:56.359> i'm<00:00:56.780> quite

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
video but that's only because i'm quite

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.729 
video but that's only because i'm quite
a<00:00:57.350> high<00:00:57.530> level<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:58.010> archery<00:00:58.460> at<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:58.820> moment
