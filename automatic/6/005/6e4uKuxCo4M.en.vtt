user dimittis asked what is the tactical

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.180 
user dimittis asked what is the tactical
nuke<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.090> lighting<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.870> which<00:00:13.440> Joey<00:00:13.710> correctly

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
nuke of lighting to which Joey correctly

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.769 
nuke of lighting to which Joey correctly
answered<00:00:16.760> that's<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> Sun<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
answered that's right the Sun is the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.420 
answered that's right the Sun is the
perfect<00:00:19.140> light<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.560> lasts<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.070> day

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
perfect light it lasts all day

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
perfect light it lasts all day
it<00:00:20.730> doesn't<00:00:21.420> require<00:00:21.510> any<00:00:21.720> power<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it doesn't require any power and it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
it doesn't require any power and it
looks<00:00:23.220> cool<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> obvious<00:00:24.689> problem<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.170> we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
looks cool but the obvious problem is we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.140 
looks cool but the obvious problem is we
can't<00:00:25.560> control<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.250> Sun<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.789> Sun<00:00:26.970> doesn't

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
can't control the Sun the Sun doesn't

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
can't control the Sun the Sun doesn't
care<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.689> you're<00:00:27.840> shooting<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.320> rises<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
care what you're shooting it rises and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.320 
care what you're shooting it rises and
sets<00:00:29.189> when<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.519> wants<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
sets when it wants to and can be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
sets when it wants to and can be
affected<00:00:30.660> by<00:00:30.689> random<00:00:31.109> things<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
affected by random things like the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650

weather<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.250> location<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.300> if<00:00:33.510> you're

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
weather or your location but if you're

smart<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> plan<00:00:34.770> every<00:00:35.130> way

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
smart about it and you plan every way

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.580 
smart about it and you plan every way
you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.450> harness<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> Sun<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> your

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you can you can harness the Sun to your

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
you can you can harness the Sun to your
advantage<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.520> way<00:00:38.670> simpler<00:00:39.149> than

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
advantage and it's way simpler than

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
advantage and it's way simpler than
you'd<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:40.590> important

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you'd think one of the most important

you'd think one of the most important

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the seasons but now if we look at our

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.520 
the seasons but now if we look at our
compass<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> Sun<00:01:10.049> rises<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
compass we know that the Sun rises in
the<00:01:10.590> east<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> sets<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> west<00:01:11.549> which

the east and sets in the west which

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.490 
the east and sets in the west which
helps<00:01:12.180> us<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.540> approximate<00:01:13.049> idea<00:01:13.350> of

first<00:03:30.160> let's<00:03:30.430> use<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.730> same<00:03:30.970> sheet<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:31.570> this

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
first let's use that same sheet but this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.330 
first let's use that same sheet but this
time<00:03:31.840> we're<00:03:31.960> gonna<00:03:32.020> put<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.350> overhead<00:03:32.740> this

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
time we're gonna put it overhead this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.680 
time we're gonna put it overhead this
softens<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.970> light<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.300> makes<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.570> more
