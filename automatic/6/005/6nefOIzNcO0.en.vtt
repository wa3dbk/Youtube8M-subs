hammerhead and a snaggletooth but this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
hammerhead and a snaggletooth but this
snaggletooth<00:01:18.960> wasn't<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.100> Lucas<00:01:20.520> wanted

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
Lucas expected that the snaggle tooth

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.960 
Lucas expected that the snaggle tooth
would<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.810> taller<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.380> shorter<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.490> of
