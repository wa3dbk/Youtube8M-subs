00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
just the way it used to be what we have

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.980 
just the way it used to be what we have
here<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.670> second<00:02:20.670> power<00:02:20.850> outlet<00:02:21.390> it's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
here is the second power outlet it's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.480 
here is the second power outlet it's
going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.380> hidden<00:02:22.530> behind<00:02:22.770> your<00:02:23.010> dashboard

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
mean if you want we can disassemble it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.440 
mean if you want we can disassemble it
back<00:02:27.870> again<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.380> our<00:02:28.560> next<00:02:29.520> step<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.090> hide

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
back again so our next step is to hide

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.120 
back again so our next step is to hide
this<00:02:30.660> wire<00:02:31.580> behind<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.560> hand<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.770> paneling

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
this wire behind the hand the paneling

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.000 
this wire behind the hand the paneling
inside<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.610> car<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.230> mean<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.709> it's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the idiot easiest part pretty much so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.430 
the idiot easiest part pretty much so
the<00:02:40.650> entire<00:02:40.950> installation<00:02:41.220> would<00:02:41.580> take<00:02:41.790> about

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the entire installation would take about

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.660 
the entire installation would take about
depending<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> car<00:02:43.860> anywhere<00:02:44.250> from<00:02:44.459> one

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
depending on the car anywhere from one

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.830 
depending on the car anywhere from one
hour<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.000> four<00:02:45.630> hours

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
hour to four hours
