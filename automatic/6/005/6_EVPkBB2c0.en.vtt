guys<00:02:08.700> give<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.360> thought<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.960> to

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
guys give that some thought I'm going to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.940 
guys give that some thought I'm going to
wait<00:02:10.140> right<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.380> while<00:02:10.740> you're<00:02:10.920> thinking

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
wait right here while you're thinking

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
wait right here while you're thinking
about<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.599 

it's<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.799> file<00:02:29.890> well<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:31.189> going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> guess

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
it's the file well I'm going to guess

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.849 
it's the file well I'm going to guess
that<00:02:31.849> most<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.390> guys<00:02:32.599> selected<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.469> Emery

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
that most of you guys selected the Emery

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.619 
that most of you guys selected the Emery
cloth<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.909> I'm<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.209> show<00:02:35.329> you<00:02:35.359> guys

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
cloth but I'm going to show you guys

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.649 
cloth but I'm going to show you guys
what<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.500> problem<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.069> with<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:38.629> let's

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
what the problem is with that so let's

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.199 
what the problem is with that so let's
say<00:02:39.019> we're<00:02:39.799> looking<00:02:40.069> at<00:02:40.219> part<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.939> a

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
say we're looking at part of a

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.390 
say we're looking at part of a
crankshaft<00:02:41.780> journal<00:02:42.379> here<00:02:42.590> let's<00:02:43.099> say<00:02:43.250> it's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
crankshaft journal here let's say it's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.920 
crankshaft journal here let's say it's
like<00:02:43.519> really<00:02:44.030> big<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.280> dent<00:02:46.579> in<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
like really big and the dent in the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.759 
like really big and the dent in the
crankshaft

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
crankshaft

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.449 
crankshaft
is<00:02:49.120> right<00:02:50.120> here<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.099> thing<00:02:52.280> is

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
is right here but you see the thing is

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.420 
is right here but you see the thing is
steel<00:02:53.420> doesn't<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.109> compress<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.769> if

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
steel doesn't like to compress and if

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.360 
steel doesn't like to compress and if
you<00:02:55.519> put<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.000> down<00:02:56.870> spot<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:58.010> crankshaft

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you put a down spot in the crankshaft

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.449 
you put a down spot in the crankshaft
here<00:02:58.970> it's<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> create<00:03:00.139> raised<00:03:00.919> parts

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
here it's going to create raised parts

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.399 
here it's going to create raised parts
beside<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.599> got<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> little<00:03:03.019> bumps

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
beside it so you got the little bumps

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.970 
beside it so you got the little bumps
there<00:03:04.389> so<00:03:05.389> if<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.569> take<00:03:05.750> Emery<00:03:06.349> cloth<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.889> you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
there so if you take Emery cloth and you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
there so if you take Emery cloth and you
just<00:03:07.189> you<00:03:07.700> know<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:08.480> work<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.349> there

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
just you know you just work it there

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.750 
just you know you just work it there
with<00:03:09.709> your<00:03:09.829> thumb<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.280> you're<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.549> trying

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
with your thumb and you're just trying

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.390 
with your thumb and you're just trying
to<00:03:10.879> you're<00:03:11.540> trying<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.870> ascend<00:03:12.230> these<00:03:13.159> high

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to you're trying to ascend these high

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.539 
to you're trying to ascend these high
spots<00:03:13.819> down<00:03:14.739> what's<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:15.980> happen<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
spots down what's going to happen is

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.009 
spots down what's going to happen is
you're<00:03:17.030> also<00:03:17.209> going<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> be<00:03:17.569> removing

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
you're also going to be removing

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.069 
you're also going to be removing
material<00:03:18.620> beside<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.790> raised<00:03:20.000> spot<00:03:20.359> so<00:03:20.930> this

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
material beside the raised spot so this

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.220 
material beside the raised spot so this
will<00:03:21.319> become<00:03:21.439> lower<00:03:21.889> as<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:23.540> becomes<00:03:23.959> lower

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
will become lower as this becomes lower

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.830 
will become lower as this becomes lower
so<00:03:25.189> the<00:03:25.430> idea<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.909> not<00:03:25.939> to<00:03:26.120> remove<00:03:26.599> unnecessary

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
so the idea is not to remove unnecessary

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.770 
so the idea is not to remove unnecessary
material<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.129> crankshaft<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:29.599> this

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
material from the crankshaft so this

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.569 
material from the crankshaft so this
trick<00:03:30.049> I'm<00:03:30.200> going<00:03:30.379> to<00:03:30.439> show<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.680> guys<00:03:30.979> it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
trick I'm going to show you guys it

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.640 
trick I'm going to show you guys it
actually<00:03:31.940> works<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.449> you<00:03:32.959> know<00:03:33.049> on<00:03:33.229> any

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
actually works like you know on any

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.159 
actually works like you know on any
shaft<00:03:34.159> let's<00:03:35.120> say<00:03:35.239> you've<00:03:35.359> got<00:03:35.389> a<00:03:35.510> bearing<00:03:36.019> and

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
shaft let's say you've got a bearing and

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.569 
shaft let's say you've got a bearing and
it<00:03:36.229> won't<00:03:36.409> come<00:03:36.560> off<00:03:36.620> because<00:03:37.099> you<00:03:37.220> got<00:03:37.370> some

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
it won't come off because you got some

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.360 
it won't come off because you got some
damage<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.329> shaft<00:03:38.680> take<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.829> file<00:03:40.159> and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
damage to the shaft take the file and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.909 
damage to the shaft take the file and
the<00:03:41.359> file<00:03:41.599> is<00:03:41.840> only<00:03:42.019> going<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.319> knock<00:03:42.500> off<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
the file is only going to knock off the

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.819 
the file is only going to knock off the
high<00:03:43.099> spots<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.729> because<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.260> shaft<00:03:45.560> is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
high spots and because the shaft is

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.689 
high spots and because the shaft is
smooth<00:03:46.099> beside<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.959> file<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:49.340> can't

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
smooth beside it the file it can't

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.240 
smooth beside it the file it can't
really<00:03:49.970> grab<00:03:50.419> that<00:03:50.840> crankshaft<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.709> damage<00:03:52.099> it

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
really grab that crankshaft to damage it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.129 
really grab that crankshaft to damage it
it's<00:03:52.639> just<00:03:52.939> going<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.150> attack<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.599> high<00:03:53.750> spots

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
it's just going to attack the high spots

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.749 
it's just going to attack the high spots
and<00:03:54.379> that's<00:03:54.949> it<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.799> when<00:03:57.979> I<00:03:58.040> take<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:58.400> file

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
and that's it so when I take this file

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.119 
and that's it so when I take this file
and<00:03:59.090> I<00:04:00.049> put<00:04:00.229> it<00:04:00.319> on<00:04:00.379> part<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.829> crankshaft

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
and I put it on part of the crankshaft

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.300 
and I put it on part of the crankshaft
that's<00:04:01.549> not<00:04:01.729> damaged<00:04:02.739> see<00:04:03.739> I<00:04:03.769> can't<00:04:04.040> feel<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
that's not damaged see I can't feel it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.890 
that's not damaged see I can't feel it
really<00:04:04.639> grabbing<00:04:04.909> it's<00:04:05.419> not<00:04:05.569> really<00:04:05.750> doing

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
really grabbing it's not really doing

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.199 
really grabbing it's not really doing
anything<00:04:06.319> but<00:04:07.069> if<00:04:07.159> I<00:04:07.250> move<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.549> over<00:04:07.790> top<00:04:08.000> of

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
anything but if I move it over top of

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.860 
anything but if I move it over top of
the<00:04:08.269> damaged<00:04:08.629> area<00:04:10.359> it's<00:04:11.359> going<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.629> find

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the damaged area it's going to find

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.289 
the damaged area it's going to find
those<00:04:12.049> high<00:04:12.229> spots<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.909> knock<00:04:13.909> them<00:04:14.120> off

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
those high spots and knock them off

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.050 
those high spots and knock them off
there

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.940 

so<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.660> can<00:04:17.810> see<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.109> journal<00:04:18.500> looks<00:04:18.590> really

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
so you can see the journal looks really

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.550 
so you can see the journal looks really
good<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:20.060> damaged<00:04:20.480> spot<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.989> right<00:04:21.200> here

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
good and that damaged spot is right here

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
now maybe a little bit more I'm just

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.870 
now maybe a little bit more I'm just
gonna<00:05:08.840> sand<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.290> up<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.560> bit

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
gonna sand that up a bit

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.180 
gonna sand that up a bit
I've<00:05:10.880> got<00:05:11.030> some<00:05:11.240> 600<00:05:11.840> wet<00:05:12.020> sandpaper<00:05:12.440> here<00:05:15.190> and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
I've got some 600 wet sandpaper here and

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.690 
I've got some 600 wet sandpaper here and
using<00:05:16.639> a<00:05:16.700> bit<00:05:16.850> of<00:05:16.970> wd-40<00:05:17.600> on<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:21.520> let's<00:05:22.520> have<00:05:22.669> a

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
using a bit of wd-40 on it let's have a

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.330 
using a bit of wd-40 on it let's have a
look<00:05:22.910> here

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.720 

so<00:05:26.910> now<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.450> becomes<00:05:27.570> usable<00:05:28.520> because<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
so now it becomes usable because the

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.300 
so now it becomes usable because the
high<00:05:29.850> spot<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.330> gone<00:05:30.540> but<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.770> only<00:05:31.980> thing<00:05:32.190> is

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
high spot is gone but the only thing is

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.730 
high spot is gone but the only thing is
it's<00:05:32.490> it's<00:05:32.730> not<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:32.940> mint<00:05:33.390> shaft<00:05:33.990> anymore<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:34.710> I

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
it's it's not a mint shaft anymore but I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.730 
it's it's not a mint shaft anymore but I
mean<00:05:35.780> depending<00:05:36.780> on<00:05:36.840> application<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.620> would

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
mean depending on application it would

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.060 
mean depending on application it would
likely<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.880> job<00:05:39.410> so<00:05:40.410> here<00:05:40.620> when<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.830> was

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070
