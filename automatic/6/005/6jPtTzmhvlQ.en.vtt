designed to clean any optical lens it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
designed to clean any optical lens it
will<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.350> scratch<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.070> will<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.610> dry<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
will not scratch it will not dry out it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
will not scratch it will not dry out it
will<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.689> spill<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.830> days<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.340> using<00:01:26.840> liquids

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
will not spill the days of using liquids

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
will not spill the days of using liquids
or<00:01:28.320> those<00:01:28.770> cleaning<00:01:29.250> cloths<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.790> only

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or those cleaning cloths which only

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
or those cleaning cloths which only
absorb<00:01:30.540> dust<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> oils<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> eventually

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
absorb dust and oils and eventually

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270 
absorb dust and oils and eventually
don't<00:01:33.000> clean<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> well<00:01:33.600> those<00:01:34.259> days<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.590> over

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
don't clean as well those days are over

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.999 
don't clean as well those days are over
so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> simply<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:37.560> circles

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so you simply go into little circles

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.249 
so you simply go into little circles
here<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.640> run<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> across

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
here you can then run it across

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.660 
here you can then run it across
horizontally<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> vertically<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
horizontally and vertically but the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
horizontally and vertically but the
current<00:01:42.060> contours<00:01:42.689> allow<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
current contours allow you to get it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.069 
current contours allow you to get it
into<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:45.030> corners<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> lens<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
into the very corners of the lens the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.499 
into the very corners of the lens the
lens<00:01:46.290> looks<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.979> factory<00:01:47.490> new<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> to
