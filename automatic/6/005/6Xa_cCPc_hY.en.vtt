00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.720
 but brain power elsewhere and this is a DSLR video 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.720
 camera surveillance apeldoorn gives us a special effect set for speed cameras 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.259
 to lead 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.509
 which makes it possible to light up in a simple way 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.269
 master flash 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.539
 the products in question are a request from photography 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 the deficit they release if you buy a total package 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.879
 this concerns a beauty service and accessories that belong to this such as one 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.710
 set with those kids some lots of tips 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.729
 pike 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.099
 please 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.550
 as bolt said, he emits light in a beautiful way 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.490
 as if it was a very appreciated price 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.200
 for this recording use the so-called spyker leads those films 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 shown 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 that is a brawl that can put on on the flash 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.630
 use a regular sb800 flash of an icon 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.450
 and by having that bulb on the flash we could emit a light like that 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.780
 goes a light bulb also would come it goes out equally between all sides 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.610
 with it a lot of light is lost, but with it comes a lot 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.030
 in a kind of studies staggered for putting on the face 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.980
 and that is a very fuse way to emit light 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.780
 The big advantage is that you 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 and of course get a light with less the looks like you're with flashes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.250
 works 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 I can also put the bond on a tripod 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.270
 but with its easier to use on the camera 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.070
 so i have now 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.110
 I play it seems like the four dead 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 on the camera the camera is entirely dedicated to hope 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.160
 and this way I am going to use these bulbs to take pictures of 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160
 my model 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 let's see what that yields 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.760
 he sees 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.380
 being able to photograph the new model but I have 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.420
 the flash used in two different ways i got you one 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.600
 time to travel upwards 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.630
 this way 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.979
 but a very small corner so that I send the light in that direction but I have too 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.020
 one time the room goes wrong 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.469
 And then of course you can also let your globe travel up 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.519
 the device that I don't have with me is the so-called soft lightsabers lector 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.739
 also from feyenoord of the departed vi 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.989
 This one looks bad if it is some sort of blood idea 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.509
 on top of the camera 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.830
 simply mounted 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.830
 again on it became 100 flat in my case 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.349
 and 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.969
 you can ensure that the light becomes a nice addition to, say 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.969
 sent out 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.769
 a nice extra accessory 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.189
 if you like this 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.179
 division box you have that put live lecturer 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.799
 is the accessories set that comes with it 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.179
 for example, a heavy set is a set of three grids 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.759
 it's these things out here 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 and that caused the light to go only one way 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.549
 well you see that the rhine look this way and you don't look around the corner 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.419
 more through it 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.739
 this is the most open zipped here between the most large opening angle 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.039
 but there are now also you have a small opening search 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.659
 We now have the light that has been pushed now that I only have a very small one 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.260
 country 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.860
 so I still can video this party has made 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:25.229
 and on the model in the background is a 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.849
 SB eight hundred people 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.439
 there are non-soft readers with a tweet in it 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.279
 and that grid ensures that the model does not fool with the flash 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.019
 but that construction came to cycle behind her 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.699
 and i have m geels fifth to make sure i am 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.769
 yellow projecting the colors of background 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.449
 on my black paper 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.249
 and thus get a brightly colored background behind my model 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:05.759
 the last accessory that I have I just want to show that is the so-called 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.009
 pike 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.889
 and also this device station of photography 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.939
 ensures that with a light, however, you have the direction you want it to be 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.249
 literally just a small flash in this case at 800 of nickel 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.559
 put on the flashes 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.400
 m because I haven't said a damn thing this is what 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.349
 vague streets are often guaranteed 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.190
 and along with this class, two intentions could have gone that time 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.139
 put 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.650
 it made you with the portuguese 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.370
 a stiffer jet gets a bit harder than the more 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.050
 sharp and 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.180
 and it also depends on the type of photography you have to do 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.199
 very important 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.059
 a user for example this if she is her right someone from behind what 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:56.059
 what to give the fat in his hair so that you get well around him 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.590
 yes then of course you want it 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.310
 and us behind the hand so there is no brooks on that 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.870
 top invested 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.689
 but moment you want someone 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.120
 for example, second on the paper when you get one 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:09.770
 study on paper 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.289
 then you want to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.529
 that it is also a booster line with you what it seems to draw against the rest 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.270
 but in that case it will use electricity 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.499
 intent 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.919
 and for all accessories at a glance 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.189
 It is the first and most important product 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.659
 tukkers is to distract the reflector 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.409
 this is a device that causes the light to flow from the flash head 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.169
 is radiated outwards 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.009
 first comes to a dish and is spread from there 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.009
 large reflector that is often called a beauty that sports 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.710
 if you put it on in that beauty discreet 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.119
 then that gives a more beautiful and scattered lies in the model 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.380
 and in addition, the beauty services ensure that you sprint heavily 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.360
 assemble like a grid or a color filter if you save them as they are 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.900
 buys you will receive 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.729
 three color filters 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.130
 and this filter to get a sof box perfect 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.869
 3 grids in different densities 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.860
 m 3 internal and reflectors 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.349
 3 other individual products are for sale 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.650
 is this a thief yusuf the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.070
 the thief youtube dome is that round bowl with you can put on top 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.889
 what the light all the way in an oni-directional way spread from the 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:27.979
 flash head 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.099
 so it lies is spread everhard to all sides 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.159
 and with that you generate the effect 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.669
 Whatever you would have if you had an incandescent bulb for example 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:37.680
 once 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.129
 it would have as a light source 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.349
 in this case you have the control as you have over flashlight 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.080
 but it gives the appearance as you would have a light bulb 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.780
 and last there again a product that this review is so pike 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.430
 so it must be a device that bundles the light 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.149
 and usually no grids that it is a dietz manage bundle 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:04.409
 with a soft contour other 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:08.610
 when the numbers on purpose then you get the sharper the contours others so 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.089
 you get somewhat tighter outlines 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.589
 and the bundle becomes less wide and two types of grids are supplied 

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.999
 a fine-meshed and a break but they engraved 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.219
 where I found not so useful 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.319
 is that she did not fit these grids properly on the face 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.809
 if you put it on you turn around 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:30.809
 then the grid piece falls down and falls off 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.669
 enne that is of course easy to correct yourself with a piece of Velcro or 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.319
 tape around it 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.419
 but we actually think that is the factory 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.419
 should have been made better 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.879
 the whole set is also like 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.789
 single text for sale 

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:51.150
 and then you get everything together you get one 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.659
 the reflector 

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:56.770
 the guide 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.759
 the attachments and the attachments 

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.509
 and that nice atmosphere 

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:03.039
 that ensures you 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:04.949
 get nice atmospheric photos
