category there are some vast differences
as<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.739> mentioned<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> applets<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
as I mentioned the applets and the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.160 
as I mentioned the applets and the
flunks<00:00:42.930> they're<00:00:44.570> significantly<00:00:45.570> different

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
flunks they're significantly different

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
flunks they're significantly different
from<00:00:46.379> each<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.700> cannot<00:00:48.239> predict<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
from each other you cannot predict the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
from each other you cannot predict the
behavior<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.270> biological<00:00:51.270> composition<00:00:51.899> of

a<00:00:55.559> lot<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.710> applets<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.660> going

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a lot about applets is not really going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.290 
a lot about applets is not really going
to<00:00:57.960> help<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> relate<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.250> flumps<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.120> ever

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to help you relate to flumps if you ever

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
to help you relate to flumps if you ever
encounter<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.770> isn't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
encounter one it just isn't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.460 
encounter one it just isn't
they<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.120> only<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.629> completely

the subterranean oceans and one foots
around<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> surface<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> floats<00:01:16.890> around

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
around on the surface and floats around

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
around on the surface and floats around
they<00:01:18.659> simply<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.470> nothing<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.220> common<00:01:20.250> not

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
they simply have nothing in common not

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
they simply have nothing in common not
to<00:01:20.729> mention<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> flumps<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.869> almost<00:01:22.259> always

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to mention the flumps are almost always

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
to mention the flumps are almost always
leaning<00:01:23.430> toward<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> good<00:01:24.150> alignments<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
leaning toward the good alignments and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.609 
leaning toward the good alignments and
the<00:01:25.020> applets

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the applets

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
the applets
are<00:01:25.890> brain<00:01:26.700> mind<00:01:27.630> soul<00:01:28.200> stealing<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.460> slavers

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
are brain mind soul stealing in slavers

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230 
are brain mind soul stealing in slavers
so<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.009> vast<00:01:32.520> difference

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so you know there's a vast difference

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.260 
so you know there's a vast difference
between<00:01:33.570> these<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.530> creatures<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> yet<00:01:38.270> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
between these two creatures and yet if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
between these two creatures and yet if
you<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> ranger<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> favored

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you are a ranger and have the favored

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.069 
you are a ranger and have the favored
enemy<00:01:42.030> category<00:01:43.250> apparition<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.869> some

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
enemy category apparition you for some

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.620 
enemy category apparition you for some
reason<00:01:46.439> understand<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.450> machinations<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
reason understand the machinations and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.459 
reason understand the machinations and
biological<00:01:49.619> structure<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> both<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.180> belay

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:00.099 

why<00:01:56.229> how<00:01:57.229> can<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.710> category<00:01:58.549> be<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.270> broad<00:01:59.600> as

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
why how can that category be so broad as

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.639 
why how can that category be so broad as
to<00:02:00.799> encompass<00:02:01.369> both<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:02.240> applet<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
to encompass both the applet and the

flumph and all the other apparitions for
that<00:02:05.569> matter<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:07.660> give<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.959> any<00:02:09.229> kind<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.950> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
advantage over them and we ditched it's

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.600 
advantage over them and we ditched it's
like<00:02:14.330> saying<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.690> understand<00:02:15.290> biology<00:02:15.610> it's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
like saying you understand biology it's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.640 
like saying you understand biology it's
just<00:02:16.790> too<00:02:16.970> big<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.269> category<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.170> have<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
just too big a category you have to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.070 
just too big a category you have to
specialize<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.489> get<00:02:19.610> any<00:02:19.790> kind<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> grasp<00:02:20.690> on
