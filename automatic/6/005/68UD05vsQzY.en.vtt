bit<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.970> problem<00:04:53.150> not<00:04:53.449> wearing<00:04:53.810> them<00:04:54.400> when

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
bit of a problem not wearing them when

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.900 
bit of a problem not wearing them when
when<00:04:57.440> I'm<00:04:57.590> driving<00:04:57.860> here<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.400> Euro<00:04:58.580> truck

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
when I'm driving here in Euro truck

when I'm driving here in Euro truck
because<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.300> dashboards<00:04:59.870> can<00:04:59.990> be<00:05:00.080> pretty

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
because the dashboards can be pretty

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.589 
because the dashboards can be pretty
small<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:01.099> solves<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.610> problem<00:05:01.669> look<00:05:02.150> how

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
small this solves that problem look how

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.870 
small this solves that problem look how
much<00:05:02.810> closer<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.410> dashboard<00:05:03.680> is<00:05:04.130> look<00:05:04.820> at

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
much closer that dashboard is look at

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.279 
much closer that dashboard is look at
that<00:05:04.970> much<00:05:05.120> bigger<00:05:05.539> look<00:05:06.020> at<00:05:06.110> how<00:05:06.169> much

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
that much bigger look at how much

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.120 
that much bigger look at how much
clearer<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.130> is<00:05:07.750> yeah<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.990> that's<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:09.860> so

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
clearer it is yeah that that's just so

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.700 
clearer it is yeah that that's just so
much<00:05:10.310> better<00:05:10.639> I<00:05:11.030> don't<00:05:12.020> even<00:05:12.229> need<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.500> drive

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
much better I don't even need to drive

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.250 
much better I don't even need to drive
around<00:05:12.740> you<00:05:12.949> can<00:05:13.099> see<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.340> everything<00:05:13.580> works

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
around you can see it everything works
