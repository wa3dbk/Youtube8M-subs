00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 this 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 I will explain 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.279
 very good everyone I am a tourist and 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.230
 I'm in the Valley of Tomba de Ong Real 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.669
 as I put the map and well here I have 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.860
 decided to go down one of the rivulets 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.599
 narrowest of the entire county of 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.290
 plane is more a puddle than a stream 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.820
 so it will be pretty extreme over there 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.620
 good kids we're here above me 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.420
 It has taken a long time to climb the boat 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.910
 that as you can see they were right is a 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 damn puddle I do not know how heck I'm going to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.660
 go down here but good will be tried 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.760
 not like I said, this is one of the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.530
 things that only I do or the tourist like that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.229
 do not forget to hit like while 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.970
 I regret having done it here I am 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.650
 point to go down a mountain with a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.650
 motorboat like that is me ni 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.580
 oh god oh god even if you do not believe it is 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.720
 quite difficult not to leave what is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.720
 the little bit of this 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.990
 You know I'm going to give him some sugarcane 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 I play 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 gods or no no no please the river 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.549
 come back good the puddle returns to the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.080
 puddle or not running god I'm sliding 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.210
 up the mountain I do not even go for the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.210
 water and today God returns the fence 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.720
 let's go well let's go well let's go well let's 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.850
 alright we go well take the curve and take the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 curve through the puddle 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.500
 today we come to the piece of 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.020
 this mouth that flows into a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.020
 river twice as big as you see 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.020
 and here comes the mimicry so high and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.609
 we have arrived 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.409
 oh god oh my good god after this 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.210
 small action scene we have to go 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.100
 to that edition is to talk to a guy with 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.860
 the one who has business in my hands like that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.539
 that we go there 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.009
 the truth is that it is fast is not 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.230
 so bad maybe I'll go back to another day to 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 show you the full good kids 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.020
 I have come to find my colleague at Gary 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.940
 that for what he tells me he has a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.680
 some slope with the backs and that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.720
 he's going to take me to his marijuana field 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 to send them a message you know 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.720
 it is here where you have the return in case 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 We're going over there 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
 good kids we are here so 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.940
 I see the ones were already prepared 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.240
 for an attack so we will have to give them 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.240
 cane 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.989
 spiegel 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.989
 ah 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.750
 good kids has cost us our 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.209
 but in the end we kicked the ass of 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.700
 those bikers so we're going to charge the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.940
 benefits since marc is a member of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.980
 farm 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.720
 it's a shame that I mar this whole field of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.100
 marijuana but good we have loaded the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.690
 van with everything we could 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 so manage 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.790
 in Gary you can do me the honors 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.040
 good that we were going to smoke we add before 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.550
 to leave if we go home that is already 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.080
 description here 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.340
 with sights they are sirens of the police gary 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.560
 award is to leave me lying down 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.560
 burn shit shit 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.220
 Gary Cabro have left me lying back 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.220
 here I speak 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.370
 I think this is starting to rise 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.290
 I feel lighter 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.290
 I feel I can fly 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.319
 oh my god I'm flying I'm like peter 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.299

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.980
 I can not believe I've been there all night 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.530
 flying but good I'm already in the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.359
 fields I'm going to make a visit to the apartment 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.360
 franco de gary to see where he hides 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.130
 that rat 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.980
 oh shit I think it's me 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.370
 going by now I should have smoked more 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.370
 grass 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.680
 this is the address that care gave me in 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.930
 case things went wrong 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.180
 I hope he is here for his own good 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.500
 although it does in my case after this 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.500
 it's nothing good is going to happen 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.380
 Gary , I'm home 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.080

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.150
 left the television and the candles 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.150
 lit should be here and usually 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.889
 walk around the back of your car 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 is that parked should not walk very 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.569

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.130
 in this apartment it reminds me of 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.130
 too much Gary I have to get out of here 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.729
 I think it's time to go back to 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.729

 I just woke up with 22 calls 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.039
 Gary's losses apparently did not let me 

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:55.809
 thrown away but it went for a few beers 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.099
 that I asked myself in case it is that I 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:59.630
 found pissing on the door of his 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.550
 neighbor and then I take home 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.230
 that we have learned today that drugs 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.880
 I do not feel good the fact is that to me 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.740
 I do not care, you do not have to 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.480
