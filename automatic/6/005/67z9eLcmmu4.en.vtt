00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.830 
didn't quite open properly or it seemed
to<00:01:53.250> restrict<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> angle<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> screen<00:01:54.570> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to restrict the angle of the screen this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.350 
to restrict the angle of the screen this
one<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> perfect<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
one is perfect so I really do like it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.649 
one is perfect so I really do like it
it's<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> soft<00:01:58.619> touch<00:01:58.890> finish<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.460> it

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
it's got like a soft touch finish to it

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.260 
it's got like a soft touch finish to it
really<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:01.320> awesome<00:02:01.560> case<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.880> always

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
really really awesome case now I always

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
really really awesome case now I always
believe<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.799> looking<00:02:05.159> after<00:02:05.280> my

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
believe in really looking after my

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.109 
believe in really looking after my
laptops<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:07.469> reason<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.640> believe<00:02:08.879> in

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
laptops and the reason that I believe in

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.230 
laptops and the reason that I believe in
that<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> increases<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.470> resale

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
that is because it increases the resale

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.270 
that is because it increases the resale
for<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.600> start<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.470> when<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.740> come<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.920> change

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
for a start so when I come to change

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.640 
for a start so when I come to change
this<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.700> maybe<00:02:13.880> two<00:02:14.180> or<00:02:14.300> three<00:02:14.510> years<00:02:14.720> time<00:02:15.020> it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
this in maybe two or three years time it

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.860 
this in maybe two or three years time it
won't<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:15.980> any<00:02:16.130> marks<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.120> also<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
won't have any marks on it and also it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.650 
won't have any marks on it and also it
just<00:02:18.050> protects<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.490> believe<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.330> really

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
just protects it and I believe in really

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.320 
just protects it and I believe in really
looking<00:02:21.020> after<00:02:21.170> my<00:02:21.470> technology<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.330> this

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
looking after my technology and this

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.510 
looking after my technology and this
adds<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> texture<00:02:25.250> as<00:02:25.310> well<00:02:25.370> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
adds to like the texture as well I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.760 
adds to like the texture as well I
really<00:02:25.640> do<00:02:26.150> like<00:02:26.300> that<00:02:26.600> soft<00:02:26.930> touch<00:02:27.170> bill<00:02:27.470> on

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
really do like that soft touch bill on

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.390 
really do like that soft touch bill on
that<00:02:28.040> one

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
that one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.090 
that one
it<00:02:28.640> seems<00:02:28.910> Scipio<00:02:29.360> feather<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.800> leave

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
it seems Scipio feather and I will leave
