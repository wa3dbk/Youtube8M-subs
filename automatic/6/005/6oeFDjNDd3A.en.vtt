what<00:03:45.340> every<00:03:45.670> parent<00:03:45.880> wants

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.520 

every<00:04:02.580> undergraduate<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.540> required<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.320> take

at<00:04:04.830> least<00:04:05.130> two<00:04:05.460> science<00:04:05.970> courses<00:04:06.300> this

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
at least two science courses this

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.110 
at least two science courses this
education<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.350> not<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.800> about<00:04:07.950> facts<00:04:08.460> it's

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
education is not just about facts it's

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.930 
education is not just about facts it's
about<00:04:09.390> learning<00:04:09.690> how<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.110> learn<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:11.670> new

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
about learning how to learn and a new

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.790 
about learning how to learn and a new
facility<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.690> will<00:04:12.810> allow<00:04:13.050> students<00:04:13.740> to

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800
