00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
first race and not to hate on Stewart

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.530 
first race and not to hate on Stewart
it's<00:03:26.829> like<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.100> wasn't<00:03:27.310> hating<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.880> Stewart<00:03:28.329> my

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it's like I wasn't hating on Stewart my

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.690 
it's like I wasn't hating on Stewart my
huge<00:03:28.750> Stewart<00:03:29.049> fan<00:03:29.320> but<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.250> he<00:03:30.519> can<00:03:30.549> do

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
huge Stewart fan but I know he can do

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.039 
huge Stewart fan but I know he can do
better<00:03:30.850> than<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.150> six<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> third<00:03:31.900> is

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
better than the six and that third is

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.259 
better than the six and that third is
obviously<00:03:32.410> better<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:33.459> I'm<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.000> really

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
obviously better but I'm just really

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.550 
obviously better but I'm just really
surprised<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.840> mean<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.049> lot<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.260> people<00:03:35.350> are

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
surprised I mean a lot of people are

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.900 
surprised I mean a lot of people are
saying<00:03:35.680> his<00:03:35.829> bike<00:03:36.010> settings<00:03:36.370> aren't<00:03:36.519> good<00:03:36.700> and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
saying his bike settings aren't good and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.910 
saying his bike settings aren't good and
he<00:03:37.000> still<00:03:37.600> might<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> knee<00:03:38.109> injury<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
he still might have a knee injury but I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.680 
he still might have a knee injury but I
really<00:03:39.430> expected<00:03:39.609> him<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.120> up<00:03:40.299> front<00:03:40.480> you

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
run with those guys and really mix up

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.460 
run with those guys and really mix up
the<00:03:53.620> KTMs<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.959> everyone<00:03:55.959> else<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:56.260> mean

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
the KTMs and everyone else I mean

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.289 
the KTMs and everyone else I mean
there's<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.100> many<00:03:57.190> fast<00:03:57.489> guys<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.060> really

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
there's so many fast guys but it really

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.170 
there's so many fast guys but it really
seems<00:03:58.359> like<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.620> 250s<00:04:00.280> Martin<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.000> Weber

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
seems like in the 250s Martin and Weber

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.250 
seems like in the 250s Martin and Weber
breaking<00:04:01.630> away<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.019> in<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.170> 450s<00:04:02.829> Dungey<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
breaking away and in the 450s Dungey and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.059 
breaking away and in the 450s Dungey and
Roxanne<00:04:05.260> are<00:04:05.350> breaking<00:04:05.680> away<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.010> know

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
Roxanne are breaking away and I know

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.949 
Roxanne are breaking away and I know
that's<00:04:06.340> that's<00:04:06.670> weird<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.120> say<00:04:07.269> since<00:04:07.569> grant

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that's that's weird to say since grant

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.509 
that's that's weird to say since grant
one<00:04:08.200> one<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.739> four<00:04:08.980> we've<00:04:09.160> already<00:04:09.310> had

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
one one of the four we've already had

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.240 
one one of the four we've already had
but<00:04:09.850> based<00:04:10.239> on<00:04:10.480> all<00:04:10.989> four<00:04:11.380> combined<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:12.010> really

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
but based on all four combined it really

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.699 
but based on all four combined it really
seems<00:04:12.459> like<00:04:12.549> they're<00:04:12.790> just<00:04:13.709> monumentally

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
seems like they're just monumentally

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.620 
seems like they're just monumentally
faster<00:04:15.250> in<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:16.060> doesn't<00:04:16.209> make<00:04:16.389> for<00:04:16.510> bad

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
faster in it it doesn't make for bad

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.909 
faster in it it doesn't make for bad
racing<00:04:16.989> because<00:04:17.079> at<00:04:17.260> least<00:04:17.350> they<00:04:17.530> race<00:04:17.709> good

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
racing because at least they race good

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.259 
racing because at least they race good
with<00:04:18.040> each<00:04:18.160> other<00:04:18.340> but<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:18.850> weekend
