facebook comments or something like that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.080 
facebook comments or something like that
but<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> downside<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
but a downside to that is that your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
but a downside to that is that your
YouTube<00:01:33.479> subscribers<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.829> video

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
YouTube subscribers will see your video

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
YouTube subscribers will see your video
pop<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> their<00:01:35.790> subscription<00:01:36.390> feed<00:01:36.630> on

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
pop up in their subscription feed on

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210 
pop up in their subscription feed on
YouTube<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.740> you'll<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.009> other

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
YouTube and then you'll have other

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
YouTube and then you'll have other
people<00:01:38.610> who<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.329> website

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
people who will be going to your website

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
people who will be going to your website
and<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.799> people

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and now you kind of have some people

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.819 
and now you kind of have some people
commenting<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.729> YouTube<00:01:42.509> watch<00:01:43.110> page<00:01:43.140> some

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
commenting on YouTube watch page some

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.440 
commenting on YouTube watch page some
people<00:01:44.100> commenting<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.820> website<00:01:45.240> you've

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
people commenting on your website you've

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.910 
people commenting on your website you've
kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.990> split<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.500> audio<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
kind of like split your audio and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
kind of like split your audio and
another<00:01:47.130> downside<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> watch<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.360> on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
another downside is that watch time on

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
another downside is that watch time on
embedded<00:01:49.020> videos<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.890> quite<00:01:50.159> count<00:01:50.520> as

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
embedded videos doesn't quite count as

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
embedded videos doesn't quite count as
with<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.090> much<00:01:51.240> weight<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.810> watch<00:01:52.229> time<00:01:52.500> on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
with as much weight as a watch time on

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190 
with as much weight as a watch time on
YouTube's<00:01:53.189> own<00:01:53.430> site<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
YouTube's own site so if you want that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
YouTube's own site so if you want that
video<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> rank<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:56.100> well<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
video to rank really well because of the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.389 
video to rank really well because of the
watch<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.509> has<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> do

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
watch time it has it's not going to do

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
watch time it has it's not going to do
that<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.759> much<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.229> embedded

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that as much for you when it's embedded

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.749 
that as much for you when it's embedded
on<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.799> website<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.250> maybe<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.640> doesn't

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
on your website but maybe that doesn't

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.580 
on your website but maybe that doesn't
matter<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.930> getting<00:02:04.200> people
