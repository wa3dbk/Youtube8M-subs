00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
thread you can kind of draw those pivots

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.000 
thread you can kind of draw those pivots
to<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.450> aligned<00:02:42.720> once<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.800> get<00:02:43.890> them

hard cranks with the thread middle

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.930 
hard cranks with the thread middle
should<00:02:47.190> anchor<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.760> place<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> next<00:02:50.850> thing

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
should anchor in place so the next thing

know the big rolling stuff but we can

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.080 
know the big rolling stuff but we can
modify<00:07:24.860> the<00:07:25.010> amount<00:07:25.280> of<00:07:25.310> how<00:07:25.460> could<00:07:25.640> we<00:07:25.760> put<00:07:25.970> on

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
modify the amount of how could we put on

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.970 
modify the amount of how could we put on
it<00:07:26.210> accordingly<00:07:26.780> in<00:07:27.110> order<00:07:27.290> to<00:07:27.530> make<00:07:27.650> it<00:07:27.710> fish

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
done is I've cut out the under hackle

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.210 
done is I've cut out the under hackle
created<00:07:41.900> a<00:07:42.020> way<00:07:42.170> for<00:07:42.200> those<00:07:42.470> legs<00:07:42.770> to<00:07:42.980> kind<00:07:43.160> of
