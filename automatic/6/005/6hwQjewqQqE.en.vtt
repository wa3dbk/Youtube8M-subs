00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is go into power and where it's as fast

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.319 
is go into power and where it's as fast
food<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:52.079> turn<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.530> off<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:54.119> only

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
food you turn that off the only

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
back on it just won't go as fast but

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
back on it just won't go as fast but
it's<00:02:02.159> still<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:03.060> every<00:02:03.360> other<00:02:03.600> normal<00:02:03.719> phone

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is and you could check how much better

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.010 
is and you could check how much better
you've<00:02:12.270> been<00:02:12.450> using

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you've been using

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.950
