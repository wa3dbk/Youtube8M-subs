00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.360
 foto youtube my name is mÃ¼ller and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.889
 I'm back from vacation for 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 everyone who was interested in it was like that again 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.710
 was really great maybe you will arrive 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.570
 other video if you really 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.250
 But now I want to hear when I go back 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 am I thought now I must go 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 start again with the videos 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.670
 which I have to have out there though two in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.000
 three videos uploaded on vacation 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.769
 was 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 have not all arrived so well 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.740
 with you but that does not bother him me 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 I will start again now 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.650
 maybe a video every day 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.550
 upload it or every other day 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 In any case, I have everyone again 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.180
 day time and now do not want any 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.950
 waste time and equal with one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 The topic must begin on holiday 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 was something very interesting was 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 and that's what I thought 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 the exoskeleton is now a qualified one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 ensdorfer and that is also in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 multiplayer is not only in the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.030
 singleplayer four might have 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 some can well imagine 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 and there is definitely used 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 be because we have already in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.719
 action seen in the whole missions 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
 but then in an interview too 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.920
 confirms that the exoskeleton is in the same way 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.600
 multiplayer by call of duty advanced 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 week will be used 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.280
 only how is the whole now implemented 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.810
 I 've thought of a few things 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.640
 First, there are quite a lot of teams 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 So you are in a call of duty 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 could not imagine multiplayer eg 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.640
 the mega jump ability that you do 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 can jump really high so five six 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.150
 meter in the air if that is now on the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 Call of duty maps would work 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.030
 we know now 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 that will break the whole map 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 because they just are not structured that way 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.020
 are 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 that is if this then formed 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.650
 every multiplayer really needs to be 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.659
 map to be matched and then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.369
 the maps can also have a certain amount 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.200
 can accept vertical and can as well 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.700
 grow tall and are no longer 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
 as flat as we call it now 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
 of duty multiplayer-maps know but 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.950
 rather, and in parts of because we have 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.540
 admit that the whole thing then very much 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.340
 Acts fully resembles because you as well 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600
 this will has one more 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.369
 Pictures we have but then you have 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.950
 then with the soldier and not like at 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.600
 both in full time the pill die that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.070
 you can do one of these to the left 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 or right that is a very fast 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.719
 move so two three meters to the left 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.670
 because you can dodge eg super grenades 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.110
 or similar domination points go 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.549
 just do not save that now 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.429
 to be taken by the opponent 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.679
 There are quite a lot of possibilities 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.810
 only my opinion my train of thought knows 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.500
 how will that be implemented? 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.390
 the new per 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.670
 you will have your suit and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.380
 then throws different skills in the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.490
 Think of the old parks as easy 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 to be able to give weight 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.120
 who in any case, a consideration 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.190
 Worth I think that we too implemented 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.840
 because i do not think that you can exo 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.730
 has skeletal things and then still normal 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.410
 perks, although of course one too 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 Plausible possibility would be that you still 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.160
 always so plunderer lightweight and so 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 has further and then own perks 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.550
 for this suit that one his 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.110
 character you can do most and 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 then in retrospect still the suit for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.470
 the character your opinion would me 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 of course very interested again 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.320
 there are still a few balls deep where 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.790
 I think that just can not 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.800
 to be implemented already shown 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.500
 For example, there's one that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 then the whole world so powerful in slow motion 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.400
 and only you can move fast 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.100
 that means he has a great, so to speak 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.810
 Ski will be the whole thing just like that 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.160
 shown that everything else in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 slow motion is and you are still normal 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.090
 of course that can move on 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.680
 multiplayer difficult to be implemented because 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
 if the club would have to everyone 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.700
 but I run around in slow motion 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.230
 have a cool article on charly 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.530
 intel I'll link to you 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.360
 can 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.680
 and somebody has a very complete one 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.959
 had a cool idea imagine 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.739
 you have a kempf lag or a newco 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.360
 or what ever 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.950
 Incidentally, I have it in 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.530
 my last video also talked quite 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.690
 quite interesting , one has to shape shapes 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.820
 something and the effect is that me 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 just move all the opponents in slow motion 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.049
 or even the teams and just the one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.250
 the democrat has a normal speed 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.290
 That would be a great advantage 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.660
 if it can last for 30 seconds 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.950
 make backes and that will be one of them 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.260
 new we will come in any case 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.640
 super cool super would be happy if 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.750
 give me a thumbs up if you 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.459
 that feels good and the video for you 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.660
 I definitely liked it 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.579
 the comments we can a bit 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.600
 to discuss in the comments 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.640
 I'm happy because I'm back behind 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.200
 my macbook seater and back in the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.459
 keyboard can hate that was on vacation 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.860
 a bit heavier 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.060
 but that from me again tomorrow 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.260
 There's definitely the next video 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.239
 for the next few days there are now on 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.250
 every time every day a video on 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.930
 I'm looking forward to that 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.700
 that was me say good day yet 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.700
 further skin purely ps
