00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.470
 and if you 're not bad, yes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.470
 and it goes 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.990
 giving 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.990
 yes 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.530
 hello girls and guys welcome one day 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.990
 more today I bring this hairstyle to me 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.450
 I personally love it I love it 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.090
 its simplicity for how easy it is but 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.160
 also for the touch that gives romantic 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.200
 or special I had not made it a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.300
 semirecogido a hairstyle like this semi 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.309
 picked up on my channel and I already had many 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.989
 I do not know how much I like them. 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.970
 braids I really like the collected 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.040
 but sometimes want to take the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.960
 hair loose but a little fixed with 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.910
 a different touch so I think that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 this hairstyle this semi collected is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.380
 perfect for it if you see yourself ahead 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.110
 it seems that you have a normal semi-fuck 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.620
 but when you turn around there you see all the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.050
 surprise the hairstyle is super super easy 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.059
 is not complicated anyone 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 You can do it seriously I'm telling you not to 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.600
 I'm going to entertain more and we're going to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.369
 start with the tutorial let's start with 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.290
 true if you want to see the tutorial where 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.600
 taught to do this makeup that you see 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 Here I will leave the link both in the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.369
 information box as well as here 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.920
 so you can see it now or 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.930
 then good as you like on the screen 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.730
 for this hairstyle we will start giving 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.950
 volume to the area here 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.640
 high of the head for it I'm going to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.160
 use a brush these so let's 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.610
 dividing the strands and let's start 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.610
 give volume 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.840
 when we have it, we will soften 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 the area with the same brush 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.010
 who have stayed 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.010
 but he's a bit rebellious now 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.720
 it's simply about catching and separating 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.630
 roughly drawing as a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.820
 triangle in our head pretty much 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.820
 let's separate the part from up here 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.790
 and making sure to leave enough 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.920
 hair to then be able to catch 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.560
 tufts one by one with this part of 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.630
 here with this lock we have subject 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.090
 let's make a braid we're going to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.420
 separate it into three mentions and we're going to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.980
 start doing a normal plait let 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.980
 to press the lock 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.510
 and another 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.180
 Now when we go to take that lock 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.609
 from here 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.400
 when all guilty and crosses made in 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.950
 right let's put a small lock 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.010
 from the front we will take a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.219
 tuft cited finite of this part 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.640
 front of here the chin what 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.640
 we will add 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.720
 to the fact that we are going to cross 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.060
 we crossed as we were doing 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 French braid but with the millions 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.920
 more loose and when this that crosses this 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.329
 tuft here we will do the same thing again 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.329
 we will take a lock 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:21.860
 finite here and we will add it 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.090
 to the section to be here and we cross and 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.340
 again we do the same 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.010
 we take another 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.430
 or final training of the part of the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.430
 right 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.909
 Y 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.430
 but we add 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.110
 if they are not finite 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.980
 flanders 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.980
 and we cross 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.430
 and when and we will continue doing what 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.060
 same until we have four locks 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.060
 crossed 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.000
 and now let's finish the right this 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.010
 it's a proportional I'm going to cross three 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.010
 or four times the strands and it's over 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.910
 and I 'm going to leave the braid like this 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.190
 you can finish them at the end 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.470
 but I want to leave it like that and I'm going to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.830
 hold the braid a gummy of these 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.830
 neighbors 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.160
 and the press when we made you 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.990
 let's let go a little piglets 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.990
 from the sides are a bit 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.250
 to finish we're going to finish giving it a 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.250
 little bit of volume here 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.659
 to the area of ​​the bangs that we can 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:16.659
 give volume 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.910
 and to finish this is totally 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.570
 optional but I think I'm going to finish 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.460
 putting a little of these as you see 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.920
 I bought it I think it's the imac that came 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.500
 a set of three although for some I can 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.450
 be a little childlike I also like 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.100
 give a touch with this tie I think 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.750
 It can look nice when you wear the 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.910
 Loose hair put a loop at the end 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.710
 but that is totally optional you can 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.910
 leave it like that or simply decorate it with 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.910
 anything you have 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.730
 so that you can take advantage of it and not be seen 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.850
 and I would be 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.350
 and you think 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.190
 and if you're bad that racing 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.190
 and it goes 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.040
 guys this has been all for the video of 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.870
 today the hairstyle will not tell me that it is not 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.770
 easy but at the same time beautiful and 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.330
 I hope you liked it and that you 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.100

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.870
