the performance of this vehicle is
second<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.319> none<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:47.920> powerful

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
second to none it so is powerful

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.360 
second to none it so is powerful
four-cylinder<00:03:48.790> motor<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> entire<00:03:50.110> world

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
four-cylinder motor in the entire world

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.250 
four-cylinder motor in the entire world
putting<00:03:51.370> out<00:03:51.459> 355<00:03:52.360> horsepower<00:03:52.390> it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
putting out 355 horsepower it's

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.730 
putting out 355 horsepower it's
incredible<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.240> think<00:03:55.450> third<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:56.020> we<00:03:56.590> also

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
incredible and I think third is we also

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.590 
incredible and I think third is we also
incorporate<00:03:57.280> our<00:03:57.340> AMG<00:03:57.820> Performance<00:03:58.270> 4matic

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
incorporate our AMG Performance 4matic

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.940 
incorporate our AMG Performance 4matic
system<00:03:59.020> in<00:03:59.140> there<00:03:59.290> so<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.860> this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
system in there so you have this

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.280 
system in there so you have this
incredible<00:04:00.130> power<00:04:00.820> output<00:04:01.330> we<00:04:01.630> also<00:04:01.810> get<00:04:02.170> it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
incredible power output we also get it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.809 
incredible power output we also get it
to<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.500> ground<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.250> have<00:04:03.370> incredible

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
to the ground so you have incredible

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.660 
to the ground so you have incredible
fast<00:04:04.720> starts<00:04:04.900> grade<00:04:05.350> 0<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.680> 60<00:04:05.980> times<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
fast starts grade 0 to 60 times and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.370 
fast starts grade 0 to 60 times and
creating<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.030> new<00:04:07.150> segment<00:04:07.390> here<00:04:07.750> we<00:04:08.260> don't

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
creating a new segment here we don't

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.110 
creating a new segment here we don't
really<00:04:08.590> see<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> direct<00:04:09.430> competitor<00:04:09.760> at<00:04:09.970> this

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
really see a direct competitor at this

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.370
