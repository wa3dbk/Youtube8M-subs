00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
for this book was to make a whole outfit

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.080 
for this book was to make a whole outfit
right<00:02:13.300> down<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> Under

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
right down to the Under

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.360 
right down to the Under
since<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.780> did<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.560> made<00:02:15.860> shoes<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
since I I did do that I made shoes and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.150 
since I I did do that I made shoes and
everything<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.140> wanted<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> try<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.860> use

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
everything but I wanted to try to use

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160 
everything but I wanted to try to use
local<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.760> sustainable<00:02:20.060> products<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:20.840> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
local and sustainable products with you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.960 
local and sustainable products with you
we<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.739> nettles<00:02:22.130> grow<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.400> weed<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.790> they

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
we the nettles grow as a weed so they

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.339 
we the nettles grow as a weed so they
don't<00:02:23.239> need<00:02:23.390> fertilizer<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:24.200> any

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
don't need fertilizer there any

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.479 
don't need fertilizer there any
pesticide<00:02:24.920> they<00:02:25.069> will<00:02:25.190> look<00:02:25.340> after

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
pesticide they will look after

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.610 
pesticide they will look after
themselves<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:26.090> got<00:02:26.209> very<00:02:26.360> low<00:02:26.690> kind<00:02:27.560> of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
themselves we got very low kind of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.559 
themselves we got very low kind of
carbon<00:02:28.099> emissions<00:02:28.489> associated<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:29.239> them

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
carbon emissions associated with them

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.660 
carbon emissions associated with them
so<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> thought<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.380> can<00:02:30.440> make<00:02:30.830> my<00:02:31.160> nettle

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
so I thought if I can make my nettle

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.890 
so I thought if I can make my nettle
Underpants<00:02:32.090> or<00:02:32.239> whatever<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> be

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
Underpants or whatever it's going to be

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.300 
Underpants or whatever it's going to be
other<00:02:33.019> people<00:02:33.110> might<00:02:33.530> be<00:02:33.680> tempted<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.160> do<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
other people might be tempted to do the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.040 
other people might be tempted to do the
same<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:35.209> can<00:02:35.360> assure<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.660> they<00:02:35.870> don't

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
same and I can assure you they don't

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.009 
same and I can assure you they don't
stink<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.610> got<00:02:37.940> lots<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:38.390> nettle<00:02:38.720> fiber

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019

this<00:02:48.650> stuff<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:48.980> she<00:02:49.069> also<00:02:49.190> told<00:02:49.489> me<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.850> really

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
this stuff and she also told me a really

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.240 
this stuff and she also told me a really
fascinating<00:02:50.390> fact<00:02:50.959> which<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
fascinating fact which is that the the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.460 
fascinating fact which is that the the
fibers<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.239> nettles<00:02:53.600> are<00:02:53.810> longer<00:02:54.200> than<00:02:54.380> on

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
fibers or nettles are longer than on

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.259 
fibers or nettles are longer than on
Egyptian<00:02:54.980> cotton<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.850> they're<00:02:55.970> actually

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
Egyptian cotton so they're actually

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.440 
Egyptian cotton so they're actually
better<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.560> better<00:02:57.799> crop<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.640> think<00:02:59.269> I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
better it's a better crop but we think I

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.030 
better it's a better crop but we think I
don't<00:02:59.750> want<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.019> go<00:03:00.110> too<00:03:00.170> far<00:03:00.500> with<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.739> idea

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
don't want to go too far with this idea

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
don't want to go too far with this idea
but<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.250> think<00:03:01.430> actually<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.090> funny<00:03:02.299> sort<00:03:02.569> of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
but I think actually in a funny sort of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.160 
but I think actually in a funny sort of
way<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.890> English<00:03:04.250> are<00:03:04.489> also<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.510> strangely

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
way the English are also in a strangely

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.990 
way the English are also in a strangely
victims<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.830> their<00:03:06.980> own<00:03:07.040> colonial<00:03:07.519> history

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
victims of their own colonial history
