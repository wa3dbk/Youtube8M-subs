 hello friend how are you welcome and 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.000
 I'm going to have a tutorial on how to do 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.389
 your minecraft skin but not as 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 you think no no if not really 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 How are we going to do it? 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 we are going to have to need our 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 handyman because we have to do a little 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.490
 of aspiro freesia and let's go to the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.550
 craft paper mini craft websites 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.809
 and how imaginás and you can see here 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.200
 will try to make our skin real come on 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.620
 to put our idea of ​​minecraft see me 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.050
 you explain 13 now it will load and it will come out 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.050
 the design the complete design 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.579
 we print the extra and normal person 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.089
 the 1st 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 and now we see each other very well we have here 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:02.190
 a printed and we have it online 4 what 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.530
 you can do on a sheet of underpants 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.790
 white and if you want to do a little more 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 big you can do it too 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.409
 expand a bit and do not take two parts 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.999
 and we need the template 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.799
 glue bars and in this case 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:18.789
 visual superti of to do it more 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.390
 quick and scream round tip so as not to 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:26.010
 cut nothing we go to it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.010
 well then we go to the time 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 this would be his thing to make a small 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.530
 surface here with cartonboard something 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.240
 so that it could be expanded and if you want 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.950
 because give the arm good point so that 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.039
 stay more like this you see how a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 little the footprint because it is a bit bad 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.440
 but as I say I am, is that you do it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.720
 in a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.690
 on a card in a little bit and the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.000
 double big and make it better and 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.050
 nothing here you have this previous period 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.050
 of how to make your 15 real and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.050
 waterfalls
