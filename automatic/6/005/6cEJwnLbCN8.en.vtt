00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.509
 the gobelins know that they came down 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.069
 the screams already 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.860
 it is now we are calmer 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.250
 but he did not tell me he has to suffer this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.139
 way not, but good, this is pure, not the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.170
 truth is that we made a great game 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.480
 He play's very well 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.430
 we try to play at all times 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.010
 football and well that's what we want 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.279
 I'm glad for the team's performance 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.990
 and well the truth is that in the end he went to 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.760
 penalties suffered but but hey what 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.760
 We could get no criminal 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.330
 they said criminal 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.699
 and I think it happens that no 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.620
 no no 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.620
 although nothing happens that was a play 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.870
 complicated because just a quilombo and in 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.850
 the area but for me it was a shame because 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.590
 because I put the support foot and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 well when he gives me obviously he left me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 fall into the area normally where good 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.770
 but hey of America is a before the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 penalties that we need and then the people 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.930
 says no no no no they tell you that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 speak to him now he speaks to him no no because 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 we are analyzing a james prison and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 that we were saying button it seems to me 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.910
 the cast down the middle we tell me 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.280
 says no no no no no what I read who 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.790
 I think it steals malice 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.570
 good we are in decisions and water that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.570
 we are young 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.190
 They hit a lot hit a lot Colombia or not 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.409
 As much as it seems like that it was not hard 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.280
 it was hard play can the truth be strong 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.520
 always always the equipment here 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 good in america the countries are us 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.040
 we are not going to count the eliminator no and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.459
 this is so there are many frictions obviously 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.860
 more than more than there but but I think that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.120
 well we have to get used to it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 you agree with some say that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.230
 Argentina that is lacking definition to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.510
 me basic and the figure was the archer and 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.519
 that speaks of not being defined badly but 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.240
 what reading do we lack definition 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.470
 today they missed goals or not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.810
 I do not think it happens to me of definition 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.690
 you saw another capable party that the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.300
 first that you and I do them in which 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.070
 saw 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.550
 in another moment it is now opens the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.550
 match 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.930
 I think he tries let's go after 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.620
 after play also video shot he 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.390
 throw the center and the center another you the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 get into the angle and it's right out at 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.060
 hands be 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.500
 the truth that we were had a chance 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.840
 but then it got complicated 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.690
 obviously when more time passes 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.159
 Colombia is going backwards more is done 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.500
 stronger if it fits obviously is more 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.620
 complicated with one last mine in about 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.730
 monsters is a bear does not stop at his club 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.250
 good to the selection 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:31.400
 criminal saves this is tremendous on 1 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:31.400
 I do not know if I told him in the video 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.360
 little one the penal ones the truth that 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.160
 pretty good and good the truth that in 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.990
 the whole match in the national team is 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.730
 having a great performance and good the 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.070
 true that happy because obviously 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.780
 we have the last half cum leo 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.100
 he said when the game is coming as I 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.080
 it costs to make goals with the shirt 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.080
 hot argentina 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.950
 obviously he always wants to do it 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.360
 better and you saw and when you do not get the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.030
 goals piece I'm not lucky I calm 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.680
 but he has already been counting less 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 I was waiting to come so you have to have 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.880
 patience obviously one wants to do 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.630
 things right at the beginning to play well 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.330
 but then good 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.000
 Leo has that pressure that you saw from 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.240
 he has to make a goal because if not 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.460
 I will live later and because for me I read 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.310
 always although I do not know why but 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.080
 play and be amazing but it happens that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.770
 after analysis because they wanted it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.770
 send to the bank 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.600
 but but good for me always the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.780
 true that plays very well obviously 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.520
 you can have a few minutes that you have of 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.430
 mistakes but it is normal not but for me 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.530
 always plays it there goes there goes for 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.970
 ahead and go on and on and look and the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.250
 true that that gives us a lot 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.890
 a lot of tranquility and confidence because 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.550
 say good if I read come on we go daily and 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.960
 is still sleeping fast I never know 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.220
 is watching TV as we always go 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.220
 help me quickly in the piece I read 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:33.650
 he tells me and he takes control and the 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.650
 return control 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 off 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.530
 10 years 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.080
 We are talking about the year 2005 in 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.940
 10 years already concentrating together and 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.960
 we analyze of all the birthdays that 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.960
 you went with your pieces 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:23.250
 the gift of my presence is already 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:29.130
 you are not going to play against madrid 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:31.620
 it talks we're not going to be realistic all 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.780
 the years it is said that I am leaving but because 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.850
 now I 'm not calm very well in the 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.200
 The truth is that there is little left 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.240
 putting together a good team and the truth that 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.180
 I am very good, nothing, I am very comfortable 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.130
 so that I do not have in mind another 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.950
 place thanks with a dear hug 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.430
 great hug for everyone but 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.430
 Oh
