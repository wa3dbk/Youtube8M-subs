really<00:00:55.110> fantastically<00:00:55.800> sharp<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
really fantastically sharp which is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.200 
really fantastically sharp which is
great<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> first<00:00:59.879> time<00:01:00.090> I've

great so this is the first time I've
taken<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> 35<00:01:02.250> millimeter

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
taken this out this is the 35 millimeter

taken this out this is the 35 millimeter
1.5<00:01:04.170> Steven<00:01:04.799> did<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> say<00:01:05.129> 1.5<00:01:05.640> earlier<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.240> did

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
1.5 Steven did I say 1.5 earlier I did

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
1.5 Steven did I say 1.5 earlier I did
just<00:01:07.020> check<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.890> sure<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
just check in want to make sure so this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.350 
just check in want to make sure so this
is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> Rokinon<00:01:09.600> 35<00:01:10.140> 1.5<00:01:11.010> t<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.760> makes<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> t

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
is the Rokinon 35 1.5 t what makes it t

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
is the Rokinon 35 1.5 t what makes it t
it<00:01:13.080> t<00:01:13.320> stops<00:01:13.590> instead<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> f<00:01:14.189> stops<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it t stops instead of f stops is this is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.800 
it t stops instead of f stops is this is
is<00:01:15.780> straight<00:01:16.470> moving<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.850> smooth<00:01:18.240> moving

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
is straight moving it's smooth moving

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.210 
is straight moving it's smooth moving
through<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.140> f-stop<00:01:19.320> there's<00:01:19.680> no<00:01:19.799> clicks

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
through your f-stop there's no clicks

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
through your f-stop there's no clicks
here<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:22.140> when<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.439> doing<00:01:23.009> your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
here so also when you're doing your

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370 
here so also when you're doing your
focusing<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.900> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
focusing you can see that there there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
focusing you can see that there there
are<00:01:25.409> these<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.310> track<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.270> got

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
are these it's like a track then you got

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
are these it's like a track then you got
this<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.140> follow<00:01:28.439> focus<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
this here this for your follow focus so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.440 
this here this for your follow focus so
if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> those<00:01:29.880> rigs<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
if you have one of those rigs that has a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
if you have one of those rigs that has a
follow<00:01:30.750> focus<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.619> connects<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.340> here

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
follow focus on it connects right here

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
follow focus on it connects right here
with<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.079> with

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
with this and right here with this with

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
with this and right here with this with
the<00:01:34.350> aperture<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> turn<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the aperture so that as you turn it it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.630 
the aperture so that as you turn it it
turns<00:01:36.390> nice<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> smooth<00:01:37.740> there's<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.460> nice

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
turns nice and smooth there's some nice

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.210 
turns nice and smooth there's some nice
heft<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.479> lens<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.049> nice<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.770> QF

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
heft to this lens which is nice not QF

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.219 
heft to this lens which is nice not QF
but<00:01:41.490> nice<00:01:41.640> Hef<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> feels<00:01:42.780> good

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
but nice Hef so that feels good

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.870 
but nice Hef so that feels good
so<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> 35<00:01:44.369> what's<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> smell

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so this is just a 35 what's it smell

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.600 
so this is just a 35 what's it smell

like et e t--'s finger the one that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
like et e t--'s finger the one that
lights<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.920> expect

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
lights up so you know what do I expect

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
lights up so you know what do I expect
from<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> expect<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.750> darn

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
from this I expect it to be pretty darn

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
from this I expect it to be pretty darn
sharp<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.950> fact<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.939> prime<00:01:57.270> lens

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
sharp the fact that it is a prime lens

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.450 
sharp the fact that it is a prime lens
there's<00:01:58.140> no<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.500> mechanisms<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.340> there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
there's no other mechanisms in there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.389 
there's no other mechanisms in there
there's<00:01:59.640> no<00:01:59.729> autofocus<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> worry<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.469> it's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
there's no autofocus to worry about it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.880 
there's no autofocus to worry about it's
primarily<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.320> sharp<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
primarily going to be pretty sharp I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.190 
primarily going to be pretty sharp I
love<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.640> fact<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.600> sit<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
love the fact that you can sit here and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
love the fact that you can sit here and
cycle<00:02:07.649> through<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.520> T<00:02:09.060> stops<00:02:09.420> without<00:02:09.899> having

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
cycle through the T stops without having

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.440 
cycle through the T stops without having
any<00:02:10.590> clicks<00:02:10.979> what's<00:02:11.430> good<00:02:11.670> about<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.150> if

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
any clicks what's good about that is if

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.430 
any clicks what's good about that is if
you're<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you're on a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.060 
you're on a
nikon<00:02:13.980> say<00:02:14.610> below<00:02:15.000> ad71<00:02:15.600> hundred<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.800> can't

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
nikon say below ad71 hundred you can't

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.910 
nikon say below ad71 hundred you can't
change<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.520> aperture<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.740> live

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
change the aperture when it's in live

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.230 
change the aperture when it's in live
view<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.520> something<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.090> all

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
view but with something like this all

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.460 
view but with something like this all
you<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.780> change<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.200> aperture

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you do is just change the aperture

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.230 
you do is just change the aperture
that's<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.400> good<00:02:23.550> thing<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.820> means<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> don't

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that's a good thing that means you don't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940 
that's a good thing that means you don't
have<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.510> worry<00:02:24.720> about<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.230> change<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
have to worry about you just change the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.200 
have to worry about you just change the
aperture<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.460> see<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.730> happen<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.090> your

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
aperture you see it happen on your

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.460 
aperture you see it happen on your
screen<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.900> from<00:02:28.140> there

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
screen and you go from there

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.240 
screen and you go from there
so<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> 35<00:02:30.080> 1.5<00:02:31.080> t<00:02:31.410> let's<00:02:31.860> check<00:02:32.070> out

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so that is the 35 1.5 t let's check out

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
so that is the 35 1.5 t let's check out
the<00:02:32.610> 85<00:02:33.150> 1.5<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.170> well<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.760> these<00:02:35.910> aren't<00:02:36.270> as

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the 85 1.5 as well so these aren't as

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.510 
the 85 1.5 as well so these aren't as
expensive<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.200> your<00:02:37.350> auto<00:02:37.530> focus<00:02:37.650> partners

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
expensive as your auto focus partners

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
expensive as your auto focus partners
that<00:02:39.090> other<00:02:39.330> people<00:02:39.690> will<00:02:39.840> make<00:02:39.870> that's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that other people will make that's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.270 
that other people will make that's
because<00:02:40.590> they<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.010> worry<00:02:41.160> about

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because they don't have to worry about

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.120 
because they don't have to worry about
the<00:02:41.460> auto<00:02:41.610> focus<00:02:41.970> motors<00:02:42.540> wow<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.860> much

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the auto focus motors wow this is much

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.560 
the auto focus motors wow this is much
oh<00:02:44.460> cool

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
oh cool

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.490

hunk of glass in there same thing here
you've<00:02:52.080> got<00:02:52.260> your<00:02:52.410> focus<00:02:52.740> mechanism<00:02:53.280> right

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
you've got your focus mechanism right

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.250 
you've got your focus mechanism right
here<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.630> stops<00:02:54.900> right

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
here and you also have the stops right

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.630 
here and you also have the stops right
here<00:02:55.290> another<00:02:55.800> thing<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.100> didn't<00:02:56.280> mention<00:02:56.310> is

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
here another thing I didn't mention is

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
here another thing I didn't mention is
that<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.480> side<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.170> where<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.620> your

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that on the side is where you have your

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.280 
that on the side is where you have your
t<00:02:58.980> stops<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.520> your<00:03:00.060> focus<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:01.050> there's<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
t stops and your focus so if there's a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.870 
t stops and your focus so if there's a
focus<00:03:01.560> puller<00:03:01.950> meaning<00:03:02.310> somebody's<00:03:02.640> standing

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
focus puller meaning somebody's standing

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.660 
focus puller meaning somebody's standing
on<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.390> side<00:03:03.660> they<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.380> see<00:03:04.740> where<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.250> focus

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
on the side they can see where the focus

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.760 
on the side they can see where the focus
is<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:06.750> they<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.990> also<00:03:07.140> see<00:03:07.470> where<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
is and then they can also see where the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
is and then they can also see where the
aperture<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.530> Wow<00:03:10.530> nice<00:03:11.100> piece<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.550> glass

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
aperture is so Wow nice piece of glass

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.710 
aperture is so Wow nice piece of glass
that<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.450> nice<00:03:12.750> piece<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.020> glass<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.560> 85

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
