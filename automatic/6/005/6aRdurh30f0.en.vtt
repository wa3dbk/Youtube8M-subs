00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090 
hello and welcome to another quick

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.969 
hello and welcome to another quick
blender<00:00:02.689> tip<00:00:02.929> today<00:00:03.350> I'll<00:00:03.469> show<00:00:03.679> you<00:00:03.709> how<00:00:03.800> to

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:03.979 
blender tip today I'll show you how to

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.820 
blender tip today I'll show you how to
create<00:00:04.520> custom<00:00:04.640> bone<00:00:05.390> shapes<00:00:05.690> and<00:00:05.990> then<00:00:06.649> I'll

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
create custom bone shapes and then I'll

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.230 
create custom bone shapes and then I'll
sign<00:00:07.040> them<00:00:07.129> to<00:00:07.310> your<00:00:07.399> different<00:00:07.520> bones<00:00:07.879> in

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
sign them to your different bones in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.720 
sign them to your different bones in
your<00:00:08.300> armature<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:09.680> here<00:00:09.920> here<00:00:10.310> I<00:00:10.340> have<00:00:10.580> an

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
your armature so here here I have an

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.750 
your armature so here here I have an
armature<00:00:11.000> already<00:00:11.390> set<00:00:11.630> up<00:00:11.660> with<00:00:11.960> a<00:00:12.760> master

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
armature already set up with a master

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.560 
armature already set up with a master
bone<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.270> a<00:00:14.660> rotation<00:00:15.230> bone<00:00:17.800> now<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.390> you<00:00:20.390> can

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
bone and a rotation bone now the you can

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.990 
bone and a rotation bone now the you can
assign<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.290> shapes<00:00:21.590> both<00:00:22.130> an<00:00:22.340> object<00:00:22.760> node

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
assign the shapes both an object node

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.150 
assign the shapes both an object node
and<00:00:23.300> pose<00:00:23.690> mode<00:00:23.930> but<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.320> best<00:00:24.470> way<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.740> do<00:00:25.010> it

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
and pose mode but the best way to do it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.040 
and pose mode but the best way to do it
is<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.370> pose<00:00:25.820> mode<00:00:26.030> because<00:00:26.450> you<00:00:26.630> can<00:00:26.840> select

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
is a pose mode because you can select

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.430 
is a pose mode because you can select
different<00:00:27.380> bones<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.660> let's<00:00:29.810> go<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.199> make<00:00:30.289> a

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
different bones so let's go and make a

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.979 
different bones so let's go and make a
custom<00:00:31.310> bone<00:00:31.460> shape<00:00:31.730> for<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.060> master<00:00:32.450> now<00:00:32.960> I

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
custom bone shape for the master now I

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.660 
custom bone shape for the master now I
recommend<00:00:33.260> doing<00:00:33.500> this<00:00:33.770> in<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.250> different

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
recommend doing this in a different

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.120 
recommend doing this in a different
layer<00:00:34.930> that<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:35.989> out<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:36.470> way<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.860> I<00:00:36.920> like

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
layer that is out of the way and I like

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.889 
layer that is out of the way and I like
to<00:00:37.310> use<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:37.640> last<00:00:37.880> one<00:00:38.149> right<00:00:38.360> over<00:00:38.390> here<00:00:38.600> as

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
to use this last one right over here as

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.800 
to use this last one right over here as
you<00:00:39.860> can<00:00:40.130> see<00:00:40.220> already<00:00:40.489> created<00:00:41.060> a<00:00:41.210> custom

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
you can see already created a custom

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.110 
you can see already created a custom
bone<00:00:41.960> shape<00:00:42.230> for<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.590> rotation<00:00:43.010> bone<00:00:43.190> so

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
bone shape for the rotation bone so

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.639 
bone shape for the rotation bone so
let's<00:00:44.300> make<00:00:44.510> one<00:00:44.540> for<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:44.930> master<00:00:45.140> I'll<00:00:45.440> just

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
let's make one for the master I'll just

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.250 
let's make one for the master I'll just
add<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:46.010> plane<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:46.700> I<00:00:47.360> envision<00:00:47.720> doing<00:00:47.870> some

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
add a plane and I envision doing some

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.889 
add a plane and I envision doing some
bounding<00:00:49.070> box<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:49.790> that<00:00:49.880> I'll<00:00:50.090> just<00:00:50.300> do<00:00:50.780> an

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
bounding box so for that I'll just do an

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.090 
bounding box so for that I'll just do an
inset<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.620> delete<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:53.030> middle<00:00:53.570> face<00:00:54.100> there

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
inset and delete the middle face there

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.430 
inset and delete the middle face there
we<00:00:55.219> go<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:55.550> have<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.390> bounding<00:00:56.780> box<00:00:56.960> for<00:00:57.260> my

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
we go I have a bounding box for my

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.229 
we go I have a bounding box for my
master<00:00:57.770> Bell<00:00:57.920> nets<00:00:58.160> good<00:00:58.340> idea<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.940> name

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
master Bell nets good idea to name

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.760 
master Bell nets good idea to name
things<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.170> will<00:01:00.770> name<00:01:01.219> my<00:01:01.640> master<00:01:02.770> master

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
things so I will name my master master

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.039 
things so I will name my master master
shape<00:01:04.009> bone<00:01:04.939> shape<00:01:06.100> master<00:01:07.719> going<00:01:08.719> back<00:01:08.869> to

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
shape bone shape master going back to

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.289 
shape bone shape master going back to
the<00:01:09.139> first<00:01:09.350> layer<00:01:09.649> I'll<00:01:09.979> select<00:01:10.459> the<00:01:10.759> master

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
the first layer I'll select the master

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.399 
the first layer I'll select the master
bone<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.159> under<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.340> bone<00:01:13.549> button<00:01:14.270> all<00:01:15.229> the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
bone and under the bone button all the

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.459 
bone and under the bone button all the
way<00:01:15.499> down<00:01:15.649> in<00:01:15.859> this<00:01:16.100> play<00:01:16.630> panel<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:18.049> custom

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
way down in this play panel and a custom

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.639 
way down in this play panel and a custom
shape<00:01:18.679> now<00:01:19.279> I'll<00:01:19.880> select<00:01:20.389> that<00:01:20.779> a<00:01:20.990> new<00:01:21.469> mesh

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
shape now I'll select that a new mesh

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.120 
shape now I'll select that a new mesh
that<00:01:21.829> we<00:01:21.950> made<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.459> boom<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.509> see<00:01:23.539> that<00:01:24.139> bone

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
that we made and boom you see that bone

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.050 
that we made and boom you see that bone
changed<00:01:25.789> its<00:01:25.939> shape<00:01:26.029> to<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.700> same<00:01:28.700> thing<00:01:28.909> as

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
changed its shape to the same thing as

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.330 
changed its shape to the same thing as
the<00:01:29.179> mesh<00:01:29.409> now<00:01:30.409> from<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.709> top<00:01:30.889> view<00:01:30.920> looks

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
the mesh now from the top view looks

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.999 
the mesh now from the top view looks
fine<00:01:31.579> but<00:01:31.609> if<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.029> rotate<00:01:32.479> down<00:01:32.779> you<00:01:33.709> can<00:01:33.859> see

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
fine but if you rotate down you can see

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.800 
fine but if you rotate down you can see
that<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.279> faces<00:01:34.670> are<00:01:34.789> missing<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:35.659> is

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
that the faces are missing now this is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.039 
that the faces are missing now this is
because<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.829> only<00:01:36.979> have<00:01:37.279> a<00:01:37.579> single<00:01:38.329> face<00:01:38.719> with

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
because you only have a single face with

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.649 
because you only have a single face with
it's<00:01:39.289> almost<00:01:39.619> pointing<00:01:40.069> up<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.270> need<00:01:41.389> to<00:01:41.509> do

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
it's almost pointing up so we need to do

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.379 
it's almost pointing up so we need to do
is<00:01:41.779> add<00:01:41.929> some<00:01:41.959> thickness<00:01:43.060> select<00:01:44.060> everything

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
is add some thickness select everything

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.469 
is add some thickness select everything
and<00:01:44.719> extrude<00:01:45.590> along<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.039> z-axis<00:01:46.249> as<00:01:47.209> you<00:01:47.329> can

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
and extrude along the z-axis as you can

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.949 
and extrude along the z-axis as you can
see<00:01:47.630> added<00:01:47.959> thickness<00:01:48.139> now<00:01:48.619> if<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.859> go<00:01:49.009> back

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
see added thickness now if you go back

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.839 
see added thickness now if you go back
the<00:01:50.959> bone<00:01:51.139> is<00:01:51.529> now<00:01:52.099> visible<00:01:52.609> from<00:01:52.880> every<00:01:53.270> angle

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
the bone is now visible from every angle

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.339 
the bone is now visible from every angle
let's<00:01:55.849> add<00:01:56.060> some<00:01:56.270> color<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.959> can<00:01:57.079> see<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
let's add some color as you can see this

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.569 
let's add some color as you can see this
one<00:01:57.560> has<00:01:58.249> a<00:01:58.549> red<00:01:58.759> color<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.209> it<00:02:00.189> going<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
one has a red color to it going to the

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.309 
one has a red color to it going to the
materials<00:02:02.090> button<00:02:02.419> and<00:02:02.749> create<00:02:03.049> a<00:02:03.079> new

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
materials button and create a new

just

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
just

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.260 
just
expand<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.800> I'll<00:02:16.010> do<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.760> green<00:02:17.060> color

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
expand it here and I'll do a green color

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.320 
expand it here and I'll do a green color
for<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.540> belt<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.610> blender<00:02:19.610> internal<00:02:20.030> engine

it's<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.720> bit<00:02:20.870> different<00:02:21.050> just<00:02:21.860> go<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.670> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
it's a bit different just go here and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.949 
it's a bit different just go here and
create<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.740> new<00:02:25.640> material<00:02:26.150> as<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.540> would<00:02:26.750> in

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
create a new material as you would in

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.320 
create a new material as you would in
cycles<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.520> would<00:02:28.640> only<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.150> change

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
cycles but you would only have to change

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330 
cycles but you would only have to change
the<00:02:29.510> color<00:02:29.720> under<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.230> diffuse<00:02:30.800> option<00:02:31.160> here

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
the color under the diffuse option here

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.440 
the color under the diffuse option here
so<00:02:31.900> green<00:02:32.900> yay<00:02:33.260> now<00:02:34.070> I'm<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.060> undo

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
so green yay now I'm just going to undo

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
so green yay now I'm just going to undo
that<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.280> since<00:02:37.280> we<00:02:37.459> are<00:02:37.520> working<00:02:37.730> with

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that and since we are working with

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.810 
that and since we are working with
cycles<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.709> doesn't<00:02:39.860> matter<00:02:40.040> which<00:02:40.340> which

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
cycles now it doesn't matter which which

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.550 
cycles now it doesn't matter which which
you're<00:02:41.060> under<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.510> render<00:02:42.080> engine<00:02:42.410> you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
you're under and render engine you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.290 
you're under and render engine you
choose<00:02:42.800> as<00:02:43.130> long<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.430> you're<00:02:43.580> consistent<00:02:43.790> of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
choose as long as you're consistent of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.120 
choose as long as you're consistent of
course<00:02:46.660> going<00:02:47.660> back<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> first<00:02:48.830> layer<00:02:49.100> you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
course going back to the first layer you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.509 
course going back to the first layer you
can<00:02:49.400> see<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.940> bone<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.360> green<00:02:51.519> alright

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
can see that the bone is green alright

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.080 
can see that the bone is green alright
I'll<00:02:53.450> select<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.019> rotation<00:02:54.500> bone<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.090> repeat

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
I'll select the rotation bone and repeat

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.750 
I'll select the rotation bone and repeat
the<00:02:56.180> process<00:02:56.360> add<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.380> custom<00:02:57.800> shape<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.220> and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the process add a custom shape to it and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.320 
the process add a custom shape to it and
rotation<00:02:59.620> now<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.709> might<00:03:00.890> notice<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.459> this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
rotation now you might notice that this

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.530 
rotation now you might notice that this
one<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:03.019> bigger<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.430> orientation<00:03:05.420> is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
one is bigger and it's orientation is

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.360 
one is bigger and it's orientation is
different<00:03:05.570> from<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.380> shape<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.769> we<00:03:06.980> grew

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
different from the shape that we grew

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.520 
different from the shape that we grew
that<00:03:07.519> I've<00:03:07.640> created<00:03:07.880> earlier<00:03:08.390> now<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.410> is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that I've created earlier now this is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.740 
that I've created earlier now this is
because<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:10.280> edit<00:03:10.850> mode<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.300> can<00:03:11.480> see<00:03:11.630> this

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
because in edit mode you can see this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.960 
because in edit mode you can see this
this<00:03:12.410> bone<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.920> upright<00:03:13.310> while<00:03:13.580> this<00:03:13.760> one<00:03:13.940> is

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
this bone is upright while this one is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.259 
this bone is upright while this one is
lying<00:03:14.360> down<00:03:14.600> as<00:03:14.840> well<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:16.100> bone<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.880> twice

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
lying down as well this bone is twice

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.930 
lying down as well this bone is twice
bigger<00:03:17.480> as<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:19.430> master<00:03:19.730> bone<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.940> what's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
bigger as the master bone this is what's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.900 
bigger as the master bone this is what's
causing<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.480> difference<00:03:24.049> here<00:03:24.549> now<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.610> fix

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
causing the difference here now to fix

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.199 
causing the difference here now to fix
this<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:27.410> would<00:03:27.560> need<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.980> work<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.940> your

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
this you would need to work on your

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.140 
this you would need to work on your
original<00:03:29.750> mesh<00:03:29.989> now<00:03:30.620> now<00:03:31.160> if<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.400> try<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.940> do

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
original mesh now now if you try to do

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.050 
original mesh now now if you try to do
any<00:03:32.299> rotation<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.019> scaling<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:34.000> object<00:03:35.000> mode

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
any rotation and scaling in object mode

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.680 
any rotation and scaling in object mode
this<00:03:36.019> would<00:03:36.230> not<00:03:36.380> translate<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.940> bone<00:03:38.120> you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
this would not translate to the bone you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.840 
this would not translate to the bone you
need<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.170> do<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.769> edit<00:03:40.070> mode<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.730> you're

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
need to do this in edit mode so you're

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.750 
need to do this in edit mode so you're
going<00:03:41.000> into<00:03:41.090> edit<00:03:41.269> mode<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.250> I'll<00:03:43.250> scale<00:03:43.610> this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
going into edit mode and I'll scale this

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.990 
going into edit mode and I'll scale this
down<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:44.030> bit<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:45.370> rotate<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.519> along<00:03:46.730> the

down a bit and rotate it along the

down a bit and rotate it along the
x-axis<00:03:47.420> 90<00:03:48.320> degrees<00:03:48.880> there<00:03:49.880> we<00:03:49.970> go

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
x-axis 90 degrees there we go

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.020 
x-axis 90 degrees there we go
and<00:03:51.590> now<00:03:53.709> I'll<00:03:54.709> show<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.010> one<00:03:55.250> more<00:03:55.280> thing<00:03:55.489> and

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
and now I'll show you one more thing and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.539 
and now I'll show you one more thing and
that<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.560> artifacts<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.489> you

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
that is this artifacts here that you

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.740 
that is this artifacts here that you
could<00:03:58.670> see<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.329> again<00:03:59.750> caused<00:04:00.140> by<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
could see in this is again caused by the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.840 
could see in this is again caused by the
normals<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:03.440> your<00:04:04.370> mesh<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.110> fix<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.850> edit

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
kind of normals what which way are they

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.420 
kind of normals what which way are they
pointing<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.510> done<00:04:14.750> by<00:04:15.280> here's<00:04:16.280> the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
end panel going down and under the mesh

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.200 
end panel going down and under the mesh
display<00:04:22.030> normals<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.390> do<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.050> faces<00:04:25.060> as<00:04:26.060> you

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
display normals and do the faces as you

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.400 
display normals and do the faces as you
can<00:04:26.330> see<00:04:26.479> this<00:04:26.660> normal<00:04:27.050> right<00:04:27.200> here

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
can see this normal right here

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.600 
can see this normal right here
is<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.830> weird<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:30.740> pointing<00:04:31.130> inwards

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
is is weird so it's pointing inwards

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.160 
is is weird so it's pointing inwards
instead<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.030> outwards<00:04:32.480> as<00:04:32.750> well<00:04:33.650> as<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:35.960> these

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
instead of outwards as well as so these

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.300 
instead of outwards as well as so these
two<00:04:36.470> right<00:04:36.950> over<00:04:37.160> here<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.490> messed<00:04:38.300> up<00:04:38.830> now<00:04:39.830> to

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
two right over here I messed up now to

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.520 
two right over here I messed up now to
fix<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.730> all<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.330> need<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.570> do<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:42.020> our

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
fix this all you need to do is our

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.670 
fix this all you need to do is our
control<00:04:43.130> N<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:44.030> all<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.140> normals<00:04:45.500> are

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
control N and all the normals are

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.730 
control N and all the normals are
flipped<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:47.000> could<00:04:47.150> also<00:04:47.270> go<00:04:47.480> hit<00:04:47.990> W<00:04:48.470> and

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
flipped you could also go hit W and

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.460 
flipped you could also go hit W and
bring<00:04:49.190> up<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.550> specials<00:04:50.000> menu<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.510> hit<00:04:50.990> flip

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
bring up this specials menu and hit flip

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.310 
bring up this specials menu and hit flip
normals<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.450> could<00:04:53.600> select<00:04:53.750> any<00:04:54.050> face

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
normals and you could select any face

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.840 
normals and you could select any face
and<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.630> for<00:04:56.630> each<00:04:56.780> face<00:04:57.580> going<00:04:58.580> back<00:04:58.730> to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
and do it for each face going back to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.080 
and do it for each face going back to
object<00:04:59.000> mode<00:04:59.210> and<00:05:00.200> looking<00:05:00.560> at<00:05:00.680> bone

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
object mode and looking at bone

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.810 
object mode and looking at bone
everything<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.300> fixed<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.670> there<00:05:04.670> we<00:05:04.790> go

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
everything is fixed so there we go

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.440 
everything is fixed so there we go
that's<00:05:05.360> how<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.690> add<00:05:05.990> different<00:05:06.590> bone<00:05:07.450> shapes

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
that's how you add different bone shapes

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.570 
that's how you add different bone shapes
to<00:05:08.780> your<00:05:09.020> different<00:05:09.260> bones<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.950> hope<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.430> learn

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
to your different bones I hope you learn

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.710 
to your different bones I hope you learn
something<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.780> will<00:05:11.960> see<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.320> next<00:05:12.530> time
