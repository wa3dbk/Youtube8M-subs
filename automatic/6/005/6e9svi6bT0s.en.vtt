00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839 
this is the opening down here but what I

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.019 
this is the opening down here but what I
do<00:00:20.960> to<00:00:21.199> when<00:00:21.499> I<00:00:21.529> do<00:00:22.039> my<00:00:22.189> ribbon<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:22.730> that<00:00:22.909> I'll

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
do to when I do my ribbon is that I'll

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.239 
do to when I do my ribbon is that I'll
flip<00:00:23.300> it<00:00:23.419> over<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:23.869> that<00:00:23.900> it's<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:24.829> know<00:00:24.949> the

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
flip it over so that it's you know the

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.829 
flip it over so that it's you know the
opening<00:00:25.669> is<00:00:25.880> going<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:28.039> opposite<00:00:28.579> direction

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
opening is going the opposite direction

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.800 
opening is going the opposite direction
and<00:00:29.839> I'll<00:00:29.989> just<00:00:30.429> tie<00:00:31.429> this<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:32.060> usually<00:00:32.300> I'll

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
and I'll just tie this and usually I'll

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.330 
and I'll just tie this and usually I'll
have<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.140> loose<00:00:33.320> end<00:00:33.620> over<00:00:34.160> on<00:00:34.310> the<00:00:34.460> left<00:00:34.670> side

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
have the loose end over on the left side

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190 
have the loose end over on the left side
and<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.730> think<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.150> depends<00:00:38.720> on<00:00:38.810> whether<00:00:39.020> or

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
and I think this depends on whether or

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300 
and I think this depends on whether or
not<00:00:39.290> you're<00:00:39.470> left-handed<00:00:39.890> or<00:00:40.250> right-handed

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
not you're left-handed or right-handed

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.430 
not you're left-handed or right-handed
and<00:00:40.970> I'm<00:00:41.300> right-handed<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:41.930> it's<00:00:42.200> more

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
and I'm right-handed so it's more

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.460 
and I'm right-handed so it's more
comfortable<00:00:42.650> for<00:00:43.160> me<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.520> hold<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:44.630> loop<00:00:45.140> here

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
comfortable for me to hold the loop here

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.060 
comfortable for me to hold the loop here
on<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.710> left<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.790> I'll<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.270> take<00:00:47.780> this

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
on the left and I'll just take this

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.180 
on the left and I'll just take this
loose<00:00:49.070> end<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.610> wrap<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:50.720> around<00:00:51.160> kind<00:00:52.160> of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
loose end and wrap it around kind of

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.030 
loose end and wrap it around kind of
like<00:00:52.280> tying<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.940> shoelace<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.800> just

way<00:01:08.960> with<00:01:09.140> opening<00:01:09.650> towards<00:01:10.250> me<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:11.300> do

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
way with opening towards me you can do

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.680 
way with opening towards me you can do
that<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.650> have<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.730> here

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.350 
that but I like to have this and here
the<00:01:14.810> one<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:16.100> loops<00:01:16.370> around<00:01:16.730> it<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.120> be<00:01:17.150> on

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the one that loops around it to be on

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.140 
the one that loops around it to be on
top<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:18.440> way<00:01:18.680> when<00:01:19.010> somebody's<00:01:19.580> looking<00:01:19.760> at

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
top that way when somebody's looking at

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.420 
top that way when somebody's looking at
the<00:01:20.330> card<00:01:20.630> from<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.050> top<00:01:21.290> you'll<00:01:21.979> see<00:01:22.070> this

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
the card from the top you'll see this

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.620 
the card from the top you'll see this
nice<00:01:22.790> end<00:01:23.210> instead<00:01:24.050> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:26.060> not<00:01:26.330> too

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
nice end instead of the have not too

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.460 
nice end instead of the have not too
nice<00:01:27.440> portion<00:01:28.250> over<00:01:28.520> here<00:01:29.050> see<00:01:30.050> where<00:01:30.229> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
nice portion over here see where the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.969 
nice portion over here see where the
loop<00:01:30.920> goes<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.720> that's<00:01:33.380> why<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.620> like<00:01:33.799> to

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
loop goes in so that's why I like to

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.760 
loop goes in so that's why I like to
flip<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.370> over<00:01:34.690> but<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.080> said<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.350> can<00:01:36.560> do

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
flip it over but like I said you can do

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.560 
flip it over but like I said you can do
it<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.920> other<00:01:36.950> way<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:37.790> my<00:01:37.970> preference<00:01:38.270> is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
it the other way but my preference is

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.230 
it the other way but my preference is
just<00:01:38.810> doing<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:39.320> way<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.340> that's<00:01:40.549> one<00:01:41.030> way

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
just doing it this way so that's one way

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.160 
just doing it this way so that's one way
of<00:01:41.479> doing<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:42.140> ribbon<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.650> let's<00:01:43.430> get<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.170> a

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
of doing a ribbon and let's get to a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.190 
of doing a ribbon and let's get to a
different<00:01:45.680> type<00:01:46.330> all<00:01:47.330> right<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.930> next

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
different type all right so this next

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.090 
different type all right so this next
portion<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.280> have<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.390> polka<00:01:51.080> dot<00:01:51.229> ribbon<00:01:51.650> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
portion I have a polka dot ribbon and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.760 
portion I have a polka dot ribbon and
the<00:01:52.700> way<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:52.820> like<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.540> my<00:01:53.720> polka<00:01:54.110> dots<00:01:54.290> is

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the way I like to do my polka dots is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.270 
the way I like to do my polka dots is
that<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.790> know<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:55.940> can<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:57.200> more<00:01:57.770> polka<00:01:58.040> dots

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
that you know I can the more polka dots

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.060 
that you know I can the more polka dots
I<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.360> better<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.110> like<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.590> ribbon<00:02:00.860> I

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
I see the better I like the ribbon I

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.210 
I see the better I like the ribbon I
don't<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.060> when<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.020> see<00:02:03.350> dots<00:02:03.680> here<00:02:04.159> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
don't like it when I see dots here and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.229 
don't like it when I see dots here and
then<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:05.240> solid<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:07.700> know<00:02:07.790> coming<00:02:08.060> out

that way
and

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.320 
and
it's<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.140> matter<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.410> preference<00:02:10.680> but<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.210> know

facing me I'll just move this around and
the<00:02:26.400> loose<00:02:26.610> end<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.660> my<00:02:27.960> left<00:02:28.730> again<00:02:29.730> I'm

make my first knot and instead of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990 
make my first knot and instead of
wrapping<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.360> around<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:40.260> make<00:02:41.250> another<00:02:41.760> knot

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
wrapping this around I make another knot

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.420 
wrapping this around I make another knot
over<00:02:42.450> here<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.970> next<00:02:45.330> thing<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.750> do<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.630 
over here and then next thing I do is
take<00:02:47.430> my<00:02:47.490> not<00:02:48.000> my<00:02:48.930> bottom<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:49.850> around<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:52.640> have

do a little bit of adjusting takes me a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.980 
do a little bit of adjusting takes me a
little<00:03:17.460> while<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.940> get<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.210> perfect<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:18.960> I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
little while to get it perfect because I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.170 
little while to get it perfect because I
have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.260> pull<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.460> here<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.940> there

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
have to pull a little bit here and there

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
have to pull a little bit here and there
but<00:03:21.450> at<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.500> end<00:03:22.880> I'll<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.300> something<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.620> I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
but at the end I'll get something that I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.010 
but at the end I'll get something that I
like<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.880> worst<00:03:27.150> comes<00:03:27.240> source<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:27.930> I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
like and if worst comes source if I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.050 
like and if worst comes source if I
don't<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.770> knot<00:03:28.950> that's<00:03:29.220> why<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.550> used

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
don't like the knot that's why I used

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.180 
don't like the knot that's why I used
buttons<00:03:30.600> quite<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> bit<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.860> can<00:03:32.040> always

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
buttons quite a bit is you can always

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.580 
buttons quite a bit is you can always
pick<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.700> button<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.360> stick<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.380> right<00:03:34.410> there

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
pick a button and stick it right there

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.710 
pick a button and stick it right there
in<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.950> middle<00:03:35.360> covers<00:03:36.360> lots<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
in the middle covers lots of

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.510 
in the middle covers lots of
imperfections<00:03:38.240> so<00:03:39.240> that's<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.830> can<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
imperfections so that's that and can you

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.420 
imperfections so that's that and can you
do<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.940> other<00:03:41.970> way<00:03:42.210> well<00:03:42.840> let's<00:03:43.050> try<00:03:43.430> you

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
do it the other way well let's try you

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.410 
do it the other way well let's try you
know<00:03:44.550> let's<00:03:45.020> do<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.170> other<00:03:46.200> method<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:48.030> pull

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
know let's do the other method and pull

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.620 
know let's do the other method and pull
it<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:50.520> if<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.820> do<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.150> way<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.360> can

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
it in and if you do it that way you can

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.450 
it in and if you do it that way you can
see<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.080> there's<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> polka<00:03:52.650> dots<00:03:52.770> here<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
see that there's the polka dots here and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.300 
see that there's the polka dots here and
then<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.760> solids<00:03:54.210> over<00:03:54.420> there<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.770> like<00:03:56.190> I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
then the solids over there and like I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.130 
then the solids over there and like I
said<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.520> don't<00:03:57.000> quite<00:03:57.300> like<00:03:57.360> doing<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.960> that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
said I don't quite like doing it that

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.370 
said I don't quite like doing it that
way

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
way

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.580 
way
let's<00:03:59.310> do<00:03:59.490> another<00:03:59.520> one<00:03:59.880> let's<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
let's do another one let's do this and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.540 
let's do another one let's do this and
instead<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:01.980> putting<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.240> bottom<00:04:04.080> over<00:04:04.710> the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
instead of putting the bottom over the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.120 
instead of putting the bottom over the
back<00:04:05.730> I'm<00:04:06.300> going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.630> take<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.140> over<00:04:07.710> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
back I'm going to take this over the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.160 
back I'm going to take this over the
back<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:09.450> see<00:04:09.660> what<00:04:09.960> it<00:04:10.080> would<00:04:10.200> look<00:04:10.260> like

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.690 

and<00:04:14.069> again<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.180> see<00:04:15.630> this<00:04:15.870> solid<00:04:16.290> over<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.190> so

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and again I see this solid over here so

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.440 
and again I see this solid over here so
that's<00:04:18.000> why<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.329> like<00:04:18.959> doing<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.769> way<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.450> do

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
that's why I like doing it the way I do

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.670 
that's why I like doing it the way I do
it<00:04:21.680> around<00:04:22.680> bunny<00:04:23.250> ear<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.570> one<00:04:24.840> forward<00:04:25.350> and

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
it around bunny ear this one forward and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.850 
it around bunny ear this one forward and
loop<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:26.820> around<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.270> front<00:04:27.900> like<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.680> said

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
loop it around the front like I said

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.470 
loop it around the front like I said
it'll<00:04:28.980> take<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.220> little<00:04:29.430> bit<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.880> adjust<00:04:30.300> your

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
it'll take a little bit to adjust your

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.290 
it'll take a little bit to adjust your
ribbon<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.770> after<00:04:31.919> maybe<00:04:32.850> messing

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
ribbon but you know after maybe messing

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.240 
ribbon but you know after maybe messing
around<00:04:33.390> with<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.660> for<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.260> minute<00:04:34.350> or<00:04:34.800> two

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
around with it for a minute or two

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.630 
around with it for a minute or two
you'll<00:04:35.490> get<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:36.419> all<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.440> way<00:04:37.890> polka<00:04:38.340> dots

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
you'll get that all the way polka dots

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.540 
you'll get that all the way polka dots
so<00:04:39.540> that's<00:04:40.020> how<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.290> use<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.070> polka<00:04:41.400> dot

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
so that's how I use the polka dot

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.870 
so that's how I use the polka dot
ribbing<00:04:42.500> all<00:04:43.500> right<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.010> last<00:04:44.250> one<00:04:44.610> how

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
ribbing all right and the last one how

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.420 
ribbing all right and the last one how
do<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.450> your<00:04:45.690> ribbon<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.770> edges

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
do you get your ribbon so that the edges

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.580 
do you get your ribbon so that the edges
would<00:04:47.790> flip<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.660> other<00:04:48.780> way<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.410> you've

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
would flip the other way you know you've

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.490 
would flip the other way you know you've
seen<00:04:49.890> people's<00:04:50.490> cards<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.690> are<00:04:51.870> like<00:04:52.320> this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
where the loops on this end you have

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.290 
where the loops on this end you have
these<00:04:54.930> cute<00:04:55.230> little<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.770> flipping<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:57.210> the

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
these cute little and flipping on to the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.240 
these cute little and flipping on to the
other<00:04:57.419> side<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.500> can<00:04:58.680> put<00:04:58.710> like<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.160> piece

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
other side and you can put like a piece

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.500 
other side and you can put like a piece
of<00:04:59.580> paper<00:04:59.790> here<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.660> maybe<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.110> button<00:05:01.500> or

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
of paper here and maybe a button or

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.909 
of paper here and maybe a button or
whatnot<00:05:03.740> over<00:05:04.740> here<00:05:05.990> well<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.260> do<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:07.560> one

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
whatnot over here well to do this one

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.290 
whatnot over here well to do this one
you<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.669> open<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.090> back<00:05:09.330> up<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.980> have

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
you just open this back up you have

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.090 
you just open this back up you have
again<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.600> know<00:05:12.720> my<00:05:12.930> loose<00:05:13.230> end<00:05:13.530> coming<00:05:14.040> in

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
again you know my loose end coming in

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.500 
again you know my loose end coming in
from<00:05:14.310> this<00:05:14.490> direction<00:05:14.930> over<00:05:15.930> here<00:05:16.230> and<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
from this direction over here and the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.180 
from this direction over here and the
flap<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:19.490> opening<00:05:20.570> towards<00:05:21.570> me<00:05:21.950> and<00:05:22.950> I'll

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
flap is opening towards me and I'll

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.870 
flap is opening towards me and I'll
twist<00:05:24.180> this<00:05:24.360> around<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.950> I'll<00:05:26.160> use<00:05:26.700> the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
twist this around and I'll use the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.230 
twist this around and I'll use the
method<00:05:27.300> like<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.630> polka<00:05:27.960> dot<00:05:28.140> method<00:05:29.240> loop

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
method like the polka dot method loop

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.020 
method like the polka dot method loop
here<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:32.660> loop<00:05:33.660> this<00:05:33.930> around<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.380> way<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.030> I

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
here and loop this around that way and I

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.070 
here and loop this around that way and I
will<00:05:36.210> take<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.720> one<00:05:36.900> that's<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.350> bottom

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
will take the one that's on the bottom

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.940 
will take the one that's on the bottom
around<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.820> bottom<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.419> this<00:05:42.840> other<00:05:43.110> one<00:05:43.380> so

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
around the bottom of this other one so

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.360 
around the bottom of this other one so
it'll<00:05:44.190> go<00:05:44.310> like<00:05:44.340> this<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.380> around<00:05:46.380> this<00:05:47.070> way

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
it'll go like this and around this way

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
it'll go like this and around this way
and<00:05:47.610> you'll<00:05:48.570> have<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.080> two<00:05:49.320> flaps<00:05:49.740> going<00:05:50.550> the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
and you'll have the two flaps going the

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.570 
and you'll have the two flaps going the
other<00:05:51.419> way<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:52.020> actually<00:05:52.830> both<00:05:53.010> of<00:05:53.220> them<00:05:53.370> are

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
other way and actually both of them are

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.630 
other way and actually both of them are
on<00:05:54.000> top<00:05:54.510> because<00:05:54.690> I've<00:05:55.020> heard<00:05:55.860> people<00:05:56.070> asking

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.210 
how you can get the bows to both be
going<00:06:00.150> towards<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.750> same<00:06:01.020> direction<00:06:01.289> and<00:06:01.770> on

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
going towards the same direction and on

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.120 
top of the bow again so that's how you
do<00:06:05.070> it<00:06:05.300> hope<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.690> clears<00:06:07.229> things<00:06:07.530> up<00:06:07.800> then
