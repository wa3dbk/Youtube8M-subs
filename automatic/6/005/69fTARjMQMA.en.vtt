00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hi everyone guys are zenawi leaks 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.500
 and today I'm here with a new video of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.380
 gta 5 in which rooster or formations more 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 important for peace 1.16 before 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.549
 begin I remind you to leave me 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.770
 like because it only takes two 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 seconds really puts a lot into it 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.400
 let's start the novelty right away 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.990
 important of this separate patch 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 expanding the flight school e 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.910
 adding three dedicated modes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.650
 completely aviation and this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
 modalities are called gilet 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 eating air force 0 and targets 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.350
 acquired it goes well there is no end I said it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.390
 I end came spontaneously anyway 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 is the mode you are seeing in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 gameplay is called g rating indeed 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 available in two versions or in the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 version with weapons in the version 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 without weapons in that without weapons yes 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.190
 it calls cold while in the one with weapons 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.649
 it's called oct 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 and practically in this mode where 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 four players collide 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 you must try to collect all 15 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.629
 the flags scattered around the map first 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 of the other players the first who 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 in fact he manages to collect the flags 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.700
 just before the others wins the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 mode in weapons mode 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 you will only use in laser while 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 the one without weapons used 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 exclusively western well evening 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 passing instead to the second mode 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 we have this too 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.360
 available in two different maps such as 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.439
 precisely also act thing called and gilet 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 thing oct 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.369
 in this way, I think practically 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 that it is also the coolest of the three vi 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.140
 you will face another team on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.140
 maximum is 16 players is practically the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.450
 team fights to conquer the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 target in the middle of the map one 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 once you have collected and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.240
 pour in the center of the map you have to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 protect the person who has precisely the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 target while who has the target 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.420
 must be able to resist for at least 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 twenty seconds to score a point 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.060
 the first team to score 5 points 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.360
 the third mode wins 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 mode instead is very simple 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.850
 to understand is practically called air 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.490
 force 0 and even here there are two teams 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.670
 from a maximum here of eight players 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.480
 practically a team will be composed 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.910
 from two jets is an air force 0 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.820
 practically the two jets have to try to 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.320
 protect the air force 0 while in fact 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.940
 the fort must arrive at 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.950
 destination instead what the must do 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.350
 team against is very simple 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.480
 team against simply must 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 destroying air force jets that do not 0 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.959
 they protect him but precisely directly and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.970
 only the four zillo before that 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.459
 precisely the fort arrives at 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.260
 destination and the team that precisely 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.140
 achieves its goal first 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.390
 wins anyway is the ugly flaw of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.640
 these modalities and that as you see also 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 in the video although I did it 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.180
 with lots of players 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.730
 the gain of these modes really 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 very very low really a pec too 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.010
 if I think the closest weekend 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.140
 compared to this video where it will be 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.830
 the san andreas flight school event 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.350
 update 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.209
 I believe that from these modalities we will be able to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.480
 make only this weekend 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.940
 really a lot of rp as well 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 just a lot of money of course 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.049
 when there will be this mode vi 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.380
 I will update on facebook I will post 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.570
 precisely the event on facebook 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.940
 normally so if you don't have the mi 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.910
 like the page on facebook I invite you to 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.769
 click on it found in description e 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.480
 you only put us of the second a 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.120
 click the like on facebook 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 however it is passing to another to part 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.140
 the three new modes are also there 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.780
 other news as you see in the video a 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 this time if the key is first 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.350
 back or select to go precisely 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.610
 not even a quick reached the option 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.590
 to be able to increase the duration of the duel 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.870
 and you do the duel practically when 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.519
 a player kills himself and you have the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.690
 chance to make the duel to go 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.000
 in passive if you do the duel 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.400
 practically do one against one against 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.140
 this player pretty much a species 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.570
 of revenge and therefore this time yes 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.019
 can set the duration of the duel then 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.870
 this time instead of losing vehicles 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.150
 if you buy a garage or otherwise 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.710
 if an apartment with a garage with i 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.960
 minor places 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.330
 to the garage you are just selling for 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.760
 buy this gas with smaller seats 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.730
 instead of losing vehicles practically 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.480
 vehicles that will not stay in the garage with 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.380
 fewer seats will be practically 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.870
 stored by mechanics such as 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.540
 see here i haven't lost any 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.820
 vehicle despite having purchased a 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.920
 two-seater garage compared to before 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.020
 he had a garage with 10 places where 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.750
 I had six cars and just the others 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.540
 high machines, however, are vehicles 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.040
 The mechanic is stored there 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.620
 so if i want the other vehicles 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.780
 just call timid mechanical vehicles 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.850
 stored in the warehouse and can therefore 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.800
 get these vehicles and I won't lose them 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.150
 then they added the possibility of 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.160
 see the players using the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.510
 rhino or who do not use it in the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.820
 map as you see my friend was 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.500
 using were I had to connect 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.520
 of the tank while when it came out 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.290
 from the tank 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.600
 he no longer had this net echo 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.510
 another novelty that you also have 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.510
 just saw has reached is that of 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.000
 having reached the unguided missiles either 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.680
 in the bazaar that in Lazio and have it 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.920
 also strengthened the machine gun 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.380
 that is, always with the jet of forte zanchu do 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.450
 that is the laser this time you can 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.610
 change color to your backpack like 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.340
 also change the color of the trail that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.060
 do when you are flying with the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.860
 parachute 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.160
 and this time also achieved 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.780
 the option to be able to wear a helmet 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.610
 automatically or not when you are in 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.490
 a bike as you can see the video 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.490
 just press selector start can go 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.710
 on inventory accessories and then do 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.750
 helmet show or helmet display also not 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.280
 they also added the possibility of 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.740
 show or not the jacket 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.660
 bulletproof one thing that many of you 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.820
 they asked me among other things why 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.560
 when you press twice you see the 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.020
 camera if a vague thing of the 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.950
 gender no is simply a junta 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.220
 I think stupid of the rock star in which 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.230
 if you press the d pad up twice for 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.690
 open the phone will open it 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.120
 automatically the camera said 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.460
 this guys if you want you can see 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.440
 all information on peace in 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.090
 description will fine-tune the link 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.760
 see all the changes 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.390
 also the invitation to watch videos in which 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.860
 I speak

 video description or in this 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.780
 moment on the video click on the writing 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.790
 you can see the video or 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.860
 however it is video end by clicking on
