okay<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.930> is<00:00:10.050> my<00:00:10.170> attempt<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:11.360> create<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
okay this is my attempt to create a I to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.429 
okay this is my attempt to create a I to
see<00:00:13.730> version<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> panel<00:00:15.179> aloo<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.690> it

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
see version of the panel aloo to it

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.980 
see version of the panel aloo to it
hasn't<00:00:16.650> really<00:00:16.950> come<00:00:17.189> out<00:00:17.340> yet<00:00:17.610> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
hasn't really come out yet I think it's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
hasn't really come out yet I think it's
in<00:00:19.110> manufacturing<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:20.009> now<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.730> i<00:00:21.180> did<00:00:21.810> use

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
in manufacturing right now but i did use

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.139 
in manufacturing right now but i did use
their<00:00:22.200> fur<00:00:22.439> marlin<00:00:22.890> firmware<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.520> that<00:00:23.700> T<00:00:23.970> 3

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
their fur marlin firmware on that T 3

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:29.510 
their fur marlin firmware on that T 3
p-3<00:00:25.070> website<00:00:26.070> where<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> github<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:29.250> had<00:00:29.430> to

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
p-3 website where I github and I had to

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.069 
p-3 website where I github and I had to
make<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.669> few<00:00:29.880> modifications<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.899> see

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
make a few modifications which you see

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.530 
make a few modifications which you see
on<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.200> website<00:00:31.880> maybe<00:00:32.880> i'll<00:00:33.030> post<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
on the website maybe i'll post on the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
on the website maybe i'll post on the
video<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.079> basically<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> used<00:00:35.430> was

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
video but basically what I used was

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.620 
video but basically what I used was
Adafruit<00:00:36.200> LCD<00:00:37.200> BacPac<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.770> Adafruit<00:00:41.360> SD<00:00:42.360> card

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
Adafruit LCD BacPac the Adafruit SD card

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.330 
Adafruit LCD BacPac the Adafruit SD card
reader<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:44.940> an<00:00:45.030> encoder<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.890> reset

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
reader and I got an encoder and a reset

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
reader and I got an encoder and a reset
button<00:00:48.350> thing<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.620> either<00:00:50.280> digikey<00:00:50.880> or<00:00:51.230> so

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
button thing from either digikey or so

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.440 
button thing from either digikey or so
basically<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:52.920> did<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.310> i<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> same

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
basically what i did is i did the same

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.850 
basically what i did is i did the same
pin<00:00:54.720> out<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.680> panel<00:00:56.100> oh<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.310> one<00:00:57.770> which<00:00:58.770> i

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
pin out as the panel oh the one which i

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.260 
pin out as the panel oh the one which i
think<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> what's<00:00:59.400> being<00:00:59.610> using<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
think is what's being using the kind of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
think is what's being using the kind of
me<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:03.350> put<00:01:04.350> 90<00:01:04.680> degree<00:01:05.009> headers<00:01:05.339> female

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
me to put 90 degree headers female

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
me to put 90 degree headers female
headers<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.310> backpack<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:11.010> mate<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:11.370> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
headers on the backpack to mate with the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
headers on the backpack to mate with the
LCD<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:19.460> 90<00:01:20.460> degree<00:01:20.580> male<00:01:20.909> connectors<00:01:21.420> i<00:01:21.630> used

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
LCD the 90 degree male connectors i used

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
LCD the 90 degree male connectors i used
a<00:01:22.710> 5-pin<00:01:23.190> connector<00:01:23.479> remove<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.780> middle<00:01:25.049> one

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a 5-pin connector remove the middle one

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
a 5-pin connector remove the middle one
and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.440> bent<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> other<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and then bent the other two so that I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480 
and then bent the other two so that I
could<00:01:26.700> use<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.000> standard<00:01:27.740> 5<00:01:28.740> pin<00:01:29.190> female

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
could use a standard 5 pin female

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
could use a standard 5 pin female
connector<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> later<00:01:31.190> right<00:01:32.190> now<00:01:32.370> it's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
connector on that later right now it's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
connector on that later right now it's
just<00:01:32.640> jump<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:36.260> there's<00:01:37.260> a<00:01:37.350> few

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just jump right in there there's a few

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
just jump right in there there's a few
pins<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.610> are<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.850> used<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> back

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pins not that are not used on the back

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.800 
pins not that are not used on the back
the<00:01:40.350> SD<00:01:41.280> card<00:01:41.310> reader<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:46.100> remove<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the SD card reader and I remove the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.200 
the SD card reader and I remove the
contrast<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.470> brightness<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.970> firmware

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
contrast and brightness and in firmware

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.670 
contrast and brightness and in firmware
i<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.689> turned<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> brightness<00:01:52.080> all<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> way

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
i just turned the brightness all the way

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.420 
i just turned the brightness all the way
up<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:54.150> contrast<00:01:54.920> screw<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.159> right

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
up and then the contrast screw is right

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.260 
up and then the contrast screw is right
here<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.820> back<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.360> yells<00:01:57.619> LCD<00:01:58.619> BacPac

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
here on the back of the yells LCD BacPac

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
here on the back of the yells LCD BacPac
so<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.299> may<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.720> may<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:00.869> put<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> hole<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.470> there

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
so i may or may not put a hole in there

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.590 
so i may or may not put a hole in there
for<00:02:01.890> access<00:02:02.250> later<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.820> i<00:02:03.000> went<00:02:03.210> ahead<00:02:03.330> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
for access later but i went ahead and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.710 
for access later but i went ahead and
just<00:02:03.659> adjust<00:02:04.320> about<00:02:04.650> now<00:02:05.509> doesn't<00:02:06.509> seem<00:02:06.659> like

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
just adjust about now doesn't seem like

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.160 
just adjust about now doesn't seem like
it<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.830> needs<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.159> changed<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.670> often

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
it really needs to be changed that often

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
it really needs to be changed that often
so<00:02:10.170> let's<00:02:10.319> power<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> up

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.750 

all<00:02:15.790> right<00:02:15.940> there<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.390> go<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:17.370> little<00:02:18.370> bit<00:02:18.550> new

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
all right there you go a little bit new

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.760 
all right there you go a little bit new
display<00:02:19.690> menu<00:02:19.960> system<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.770> pen<00:02:21.730> lalu<00:02:22.060> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
version of the firmware might maybe just

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
version of the firmware might maybe just
the<00:02:27.130> change<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.120> main<00:02:28.420> marlin<00:02:28.840> branch<00:02:29.260> to

the change in the main marlin branch to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
but I don't know I just show you that

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:56.780 
but I don't know I just show you that
it's<00:02:34.360> working<00:02:34.770> here's<00:02:35.770> my<00:02:35.830> card<00:02:36.490> menu

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
if you used one of these before it's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.450 
if you used one of these before it's
pretty<00:02:59.470> much<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> same<00:03:05.340> exceed<00:03:06.340> a
