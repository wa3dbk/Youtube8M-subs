today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.179 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
make<00:00:05.779> this<00:00:05.930> big<00:00:06.260> building<00:00:06.590> with<00:00:06.890> the<00:00:07.010> two

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
make this big building with the two

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.060 
make this big building with the two
towers<00:00:07.460> on<00:00:07.850> top<00:00:08.180> so<00:00:09.049> why<00:00:09.559> don't<00:00:09.710> we<00:00:09.740> just<00:00:09.920> go

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
towers on top so why don't we just go

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.470 
towers on top so why don't we just go
ahead<00:00:10.100> and<00:00:10.610> jump<00:00:10.969> into<00:00:11.240> everything<00:00:13.150> all<00:00:14.150> right

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
ahead and jump into everything all right

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.790 
ahead and jump into everything all right
so<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:14.750> start<00:00:14.990> off<00:00:15.110> making<00:00:15.320> this<00:00:15.530> building

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
so to start off making this building

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.350 
so to start off making this building
you're<00:00:16.099> going<00:00:16.130> to<00:00:16.279> go<00:00:16.369> to<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:16.580> tower<00:00:16.820> that<00:00:17.240> we

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
you're going to go to the tower that we

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.590 
you're going to go to the tower that we
just<00:00:17.630> built<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.230> you're<00:00:18.619> going<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.800> go<00:00:19.009> to<00:00:19.600> the

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
just built and you're going to go to the

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.269 
just built and you're going to go to the
right<00:00:20.960> of<00:00:21.170> it<00:00:21.289> because<00:00:21.710> if<00:00:21.920> you're<00:00:22.070> facing

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
right of it because if you're facing

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.400 
right of it because if you're facing
Hogwarts<00:00:22.789> get<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.420> right<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:23.689> it<00:00:23.779> and<00:00:24.170> you're

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
Hogwarts get the right of it and you're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.290 
Hogwarts get the right of it and you're
going<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.560> go<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.949> last<00:00:25.189> zigzag<00:00:25.820> that's

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
going to go to the last zigzag that's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.599 
going to go to the last zigzag that's
sort<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:26.900> when<00:00:27.109> we<00:00:27.140> go<00:00:27.350> diagonal<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.400> last

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
sort of when we go diagonal the last

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.040 
sort of when we go diagonal the last
zigzag<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:29.210> you're<00:00:29.330> going<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.510> build<00:00:29.720> it<00:00:29.900> out

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
zigzag and you're going to build it out

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.530 
zigzag and you're going to build it out
25<00:00:30.859> long<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:31.550> you're<00:00:31.820> going<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.000> do<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.239> exact

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
25 long and you're going to do the exact

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.509 
25 long and you're going to do the exact
same<00:00:32.570> thing<00:00:33.050> on<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.530> other<00:00:33.559> side<00:00:33.800> at<00:00:34.280> that

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
same thing on the other side at that

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.490 
same thing on the other side at that
last<00:00:34.879> point<00:00:35.210> you're<00:00:36.050> going<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.230> bring<00:00:36.350> them

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
last point you're going to bring them

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.930 
last point you're going to bring them
together<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.100> you're<00:00:37.280> going<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.460> link<00:00:37.790> them

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
together and you're going to link them

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.750 
together and you're going to link them
together<00:00:38.149> into<00:00:38.630> a<00:00:38.809> rectangle<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.710> then<00:00:40.489> I'm

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
together into a rectangle and then I'm

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.330 
together into a rectangle and then I'm
also<00:00:41.030> going<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.360> make<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.660> walls<00:00:41.899> 12<00:00:42.469> high<00:00:42.680> so

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
also going to make the walls 12 high so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.830 
also going to make the walls 12 high so
you're<00:00:43.760> just<00:00:43.879> going<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.059> want<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.239> fill<00:00:44.450> all<00:00:44.690> of

finish that now that I finished filling
in<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.700> walls<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.180> I've<00:00:50.300> also<00:00:50.450> added<00:00:50.629> the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
in the walls and I've also added the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.959 
in the walls and I've also added the
topper<00:00:51.500> of<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.770> roof<00:00:51.980> on<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:52.219> I'm<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:52.910> to

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
topper of a roof on it I'm going to

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.430 
topper of a roof on it I'm going to
start<00:00:53.210> building<00:00:53.360> with<00:00:53.660> two<00:00:53.870> pillars<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.289> are

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
start building with two pillars that are

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.069 
start building with two pillars that are
going<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.620> go<00:00:54.770> on<00:00:54.949> top<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.120> so

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
going to go on top of this and so

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.979 
going to go on top of this and so
basically<00:00:57.379> what<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.649> have<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.250> I

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
basically what you have to do is I

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.639 
basically what you have to do is I
started<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.739> in<00:01:01.039> on<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.510> right<00:01:02.840> side<00:01:02.870> right<00:01:03.469> at

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
started to in on the right side right at

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.290 
started to in on the right side right at
your<00:01:03.739> face<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.160> forefront<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.670> all<00:01:04.789> boards<00:01:05.089> so

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
your face a forefront of all boards so

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.859 
your face a forefront of all boards so
foot<00:01:05.570> left<00:01:05.869> right<00:01:06.080> now<00:01:06.399> and<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:08.150> built<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.630> out

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
foot left right now and I built it out

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.580 
foot left right now and I built it out
one<00:01:09.740> two<00:01:10.159> three<00:01:10.580> four<00:01:11.030> five<00:01:11.360> six<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.110> then<00:01:12.170> in

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
one two three four five six and then in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.940 
one two three four five six and then in
my<00:01:12.650> diagonal<00:01:13.189> two<00:01:13.400> then<00:01:14.180> four<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:15.799> is

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
my diagonal two then four so this is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.740 
my diagonal two then four so this is
going<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.159> be<00:01:16.250> more<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.580> an<00:01:16.729> oval<00:01:17.150> tower<00:01:17.420> than

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
going to be more of an oval tower than

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.660 
going to be more of an oval tower than
circles<00:01:18.260> like<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.740> had<00:01:18.920> on<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.130> other<00:01:19.159> towers

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
circles like we had on the other towers

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.020 
circles like we had on the other towers
and<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:20.360> two<00:01:20.659> again<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.290> then<00:01:21.799> six<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.549> then

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and then two again and then six and then

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.929 
and then two again and then six and then
two<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.600> then<00:01:23.780> four<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:25.280> did<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.670> the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
two and then four and I did that on the

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.580 
two and then four and I did that on the
other<00:01:26.090> side<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:26.689> well<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.560> was<00:01:28.159> one<00:01:28.610> to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
other side as well and this was one to

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.499 
other side as well and this was one to
narrow<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.009> had<00:01:31.189> to<00:01:31.310> add<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.119> tower

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
narrow so I had to add in this tower

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.050 
narrow so I had to add in this tower
this<00:01:33.290> I<00:01:33.560> mean<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.009> one<00:01:34.280> wall<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.790> how<00:01:34.909> its

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
this I mean this one wall see how its

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.280 
this I mean this one wall see how its
extra<00:01:35.390> there<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.780> there's<00:01:35.930> no<00:01:36.049> brick

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
extra there and there's no brick

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.740 
extra there and there's no brick
covering<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> added<00:01:37.939> in<00:01:38.060> as<00:01:38.240> well<00:01:38.479> and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
covering it that I added in as well and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.810 
covering it that I added in as well and
because<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.680> wanted<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.070> towers<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.520> be<00:01:40.579> bigger

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
because I wanted the towers to be bigger

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.550 
because I wanted the towers to be bigger
I<00:01:40.909> could<00:01:41.210> have<00:01:41.329> only<00:01:41.479> made<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.810> five<00:01:41.990> across<00:01:42.229> on

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
I could have only made it five across on

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.080 
I could have only made it five across on
this<00:01:42.860> side<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:43.640> wanted<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.000> be

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
this side but I really wanted it to be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.590 
this side but I really wanted it to be
six<00:01:44.450> um<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:46.009> don't<00:01:46.220> think<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.759> looks<00:01:46.909> bad<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
six um I don't think it looks bad but I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.030 
six um I don't think it looks bad but I
know<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.930> some<00:01:48.229> people<00:01:48.350> might<00:01:48.680> not<00:01:48.710> like

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
know that some people might not like

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.130 
know that some people might not like
that<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.549> obviously<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:50.479> can<00:01:50.509> get<00:01:50.750> rid<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:51.020> it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
that so obviously you can get rid of it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.109 
that so obviously you can get rid of it
or<00:01:51.380> what<00:01:52.280> I'm<00:01:52.369> probably<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.670> gonna<00:01:52.880> end<00:01:53.030> up

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
or what I'm probably just gonna end up

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.280 
or what I'm probably just gonna end up
doing<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.540> I'm<00:01:53.659> just<00:01:53.780> going<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:53.930> put<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.110> little

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
doing is I'm just going to put a little

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.929 
doing is I'm just going to put a little
brick<00:01:54.590> topper<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.670> kind<00:01:55.850> of

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
brick topper on it so it's just kind of

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.639 
brick topper on it so it's just kind of
blends<00:01:56.149> in<00:01:56.329> you<00:01:56.960> can't<00:01:57.170> even<00:01:57.320> really<00:01:57.530> tell

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
blends in you can't even really tell

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.580 
blends in you can't even really tell
that<00:01:57.860> anything's<00:01:58.399> off<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.299> anyhow<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:00.439> that's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that anything's off but anyhow so that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.380 
that anything's off but anyhow so that's
what<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:00.860> did<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.340> now<00:02:01.549> next<00:02:01.909> what<00:02:02.119> I'm<00:02:02.210> going

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
of loop it around in a circle and then

of loop it around in a circle and then
for<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.349> last<00:02:31.590> row<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.800> one
