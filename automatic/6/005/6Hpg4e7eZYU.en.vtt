00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:08.620
 we are in a part of the anniversary 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.760
 twenty-one 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.019
 now I'm going to synchronize the audio 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.029
 because you can not enter it well 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.890
 first of all remember I'm recording 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.960
 totally live do not forget about 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.430
 pass here below subscribe comment 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.029
 what do you think about this type of gameplays? 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.329
 be very attentive because I believe that the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.890
 Saturday morning I go up from ccoo to 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.079
 being able to participate in the hotel I saw it already 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.510
 I want to be more or less had the 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.489
 idea so be very attentive to this 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.969
 video so you do not miss any 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.969
 detail ok 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.350
 remember 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm focused on recording the gameplay 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.540
 that's why suddenly I do not speak in the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 camera because I'm concentrate disk 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.710
 obviously not 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.660
 does not affect much if I'm talking not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.450
 but since I'm not trying to record 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.830
 totally live and hopefully in this 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.420
 gameplay take good as it had 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.190
 commented on the time and the past always 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.230
 that I intend to record something is when 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.030
 the worst game in the world comes out and it does not come out 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.180
 No clip was just when I do not record 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 it's when he took out some killings 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.290
 Boy was not going to stain because he did not go out 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.540
 someone but good we're going to try that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 in the gameplay come out well 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 slowly 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.530
 please fight against the other 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.530
 sniper 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.990
 and we're already missing that's all thanks 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 friends, thank you really 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.220
 although we are going to dominate it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.140
 of late beats in that same experience 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.430
 scream today you start the goats that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.700
 they have to be red in terrible 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.220
 advance and the one above now we are going to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.640
 start making the kill go to give it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.210
 their legs these bloggers did not have for 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.210
 not here 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.800
 one 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.800
 and I did not kill him he has fired ok 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.830
 and two perfect we go well 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.710
 double 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 It creates jobs and health 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.230
 nothing was good 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:38.040
 we are going well, it seems that he does not know 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.230
 even know with control 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:49.310
 of the other team if it is for visibility 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 I wish the audio would be 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 honestly all the rhythms of these 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.590
 weapons I do not know I do not know how often 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.590
 they look like 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.890
 before the game 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.120
 it was no longer perfect friends I had 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.250
 perfect hopes of gameplay died the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.340
 best possible way 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.220
 yes yes giving me 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.380
 every how much present to enter 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.380
 in my team goats 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.550
 is in the tower so they support on 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.560
 You are seeing what is what most 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.709
 import 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.129
 honestly appears appears appears not 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.129
 I want to appear 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.860
 why 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.040
 remember that lopez is going to be ice 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:04:01.739
 good anniversary to those in the collection 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.629
 after possibly the next week 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.489
 I will build one that is of halo reach 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.939
 360 and be playing in halo reach 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.670
 right now I want to try the one this will play 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.290
 and do the extreme and I do not know why but 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.500
 that appears the type experience is going to 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.500
 win 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.090
 and you of izmir and perfer bad but bad 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.090

 it's my dog 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.800
 you are always seeing yourself in the green 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:40.439
 the one that stops him 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.439
 and we are going to help you a little aesthetically 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.050
 the shots better 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.069
 although that's why 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.069
 to ramÃ³n of this one 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.250
 he can not kill him 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.790
 and it's all good because the others lose me 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.500
 do not even think 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.520
 intervene good this still 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.930
 let's go well that guy what 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.190
 do not stain and nothing 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.190
 by the slider 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.409
 this gameplay is half boring because 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.409
 the very goat teams 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.920
 and no no no no 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.389
 they come to my part when I'm screaming 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.600
 I mean my family 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.590
 the spots 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.240
 is double where I enter triple 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.790
 there is no triple 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.470
 we are going around here 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.470
 Half the map I do not know 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 mate 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.930
 that for assistance that's the least 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.930
 I want 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.540
 tomato 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.199
 Y 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.450
 Do not stain who wrote 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.070
 Now if you put that also triple 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.070

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.100
 people to this ranking

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.130

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.870
 I miss the truth this is all very slow 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.090

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.890
