hi<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:15.440> guys<00:00:15.589> in<00:00:15.740> trouble<00:00:15.919> talking<00:00:16.490> about

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
hi the guys in trouble talking about

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.000 
hi the guys in trouble talking about
shared<00:00:17.029> storage<00:00:17.390> in<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.750> Microsoft<00:00:18.199> hyper-v

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
shared storage in a Microsoft hyper-v

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.310 
shared storage in a Microsoft hyper-v
environment<00:00:19.130> for<00:00:20.029> high<00:00:20.119> availability<00:00:20.320> so

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
environment for high availability so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.689 
environment for high availability so
Matt<00:00:21.500> when<00:00:21.619> it<00:00:21.710> comes<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:21.980> deploying<00:00:22.189> Drobo

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
Matt when it comes to deploying Drobo

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.550 
Matt when it comes to deploying Drobo
storage<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.240> hyper-v<00:00:23.660> what<00:00:24.080> are<00:00:24.230> some<00:00:24.349> of<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
storage and hyper-v what are some of the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620 
storage and hyper-v what are some of the
reasons<00:00:24.980> why<00:00:25.369> you<00:00:25.429> want<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.029> go<00:00:26.179> with<00:00:26.420> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
reasons why you want to go with a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.820 
reasons why you want to go with a
network<00:00:27.019> storage<00:00:27.320> solution

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
network storage solution

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.249 
network storage solution
sure<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:28.460> with<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.849> durable<00:00:29.630> solution<00:00:30.050> we<00:00:30.140> do

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
sure so with the durable solution we do

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.080 
sure so with the durable solution we do
support<00:00:30.619> clustered<00:00:31.130> shared<00:00:31.400> volumes<00:00:31.789> so<00:00:31.970> we

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
support clustered shared volumes so we

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.299 
support clustered shared volumes so we
can<00:00:32.240> go<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.540> do<00:00:32.840> our<00:00:32.989> hot<00:00:33.230> migrations<00:00:33.890> between

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
can go and do our hot migrations between

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.400 
can go and do our hot migrations between
our<00:00:34.460> hypervisors<00:00:35.090> for<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.480> zero<00:00:35.809> downtime

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
our hypervisors for a zero downtime

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.680 
our hypervisors for a zero downtime
migration<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.820> other<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:38.450> can<00:00:38.539> be<00:00:38.600> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
migration the other is it can be the

in<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:51.530> hyper-v<00:00:52.010> environment<00:00:52.039> especially<00:00:52.789> you

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
in a hyper-v environment especially you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.970 
in a hyper-v environment especially you
need<00:00:53.149> some<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.629> things<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.859> can

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
need some of the things that you can

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.500 
need some of the things that you can
take<00:00:55.100> advantage<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.550> Drobo<00:00:55.879> oh<00:00:56.059> yeah<00:00:56.270> we<00:00:56.390> do

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
take advantage of on Drobo oh yeah we do

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.849 
take advantage of on Drobo oh yeah we do
everything<00:00:56.719> we<00:00:56.930> can<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:57.170> make<00:00:57.350> drill<00:00:57.590> was<00:00:57.739> as

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
everything we can to make drill was as

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.290 
everything we can to make drill was as
easy<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.250> use<00:00:58.309> as<00:00:58.430> possible<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.090> when<00:00:59.180> you're

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
easy to use as possible so when you're

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.599 
easy to use as possible so when you're
deploying<00:00:59.660> you<00:01:00.230> know<00:01:00.289> hyper-v<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.430> last

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
deploying you know hyper-v the last

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:02.830 
deploying you know hyper-v the last
thing<00:01:01.820> you're<00:01:01.940> thinking<00:01:02.120> about<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.629> lot<00:01:02.719> of

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
thing you're thinking about is a lot of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.600 
thing you're thinking about is a lot of
complex<00:01:03.230> storage<00:01:03.620> deployments<00:01:04.520> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
complex storage deployments and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.760 
complex storage deployments and
configurations<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.110> know<00:01:06.200> technology

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
configurations but you know technology

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.560 
configurations but you know technology
we<00:01:06.860> recently<00:01:07.040> put<00:01:07.340> into<00:01:07.520> Drobo<00:01:07.880> called<00:01:08.330> data

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
we recently put into Drobo called data

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.690 
we recently put into Drobo called data
where<00:01:08.810> tiering<00:01:09.350> allows<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.860> put<00:01:10.040> SSDs<00:01:10.490> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
where tiering allows you to put SSDs and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.730 
where tiering allows you to put SSDs and
hard<00:01:11.150> disk<00:01:11.330> drives<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.840> same<00:01:12.020> same

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
hard disk drives in the same same

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.310 
hard disk drives in the same same
chassis<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.400> gives<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.240> both<00:01:14.450> capacity<00:01:15.140> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
chassis and gives you both capacity and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.500 
chassis and gives you both capacity and
performance<00:01:15.680> in<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.730> very<00:01:16.910> affordable<00:01:17.270> price

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
performance in a very affordable price

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.810 
performance in a very affordable price
so<00:01:17.540> you're<00:01:17.840> not<00:01:17.960> into<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.290> expense<00:01:18.980> of<00:01:19.130> $50,000

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
so you're not into a expense of $50,000

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.370 
so you're not into a expense of $50,000
plus<00:01:19.940> solution<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.870> have<00:01:20.990> those<00:01:21.110> types<00:01:21.320> of

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
plus solution to to have those types of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.740 
plus solution to to have those types of
capabilities<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.250> agree<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.360> addition<00:01:23.660> to

talk with us on live chat it might be

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.990 
talk with us on live chat it might be
the<00:01:27.620> first<00:01:27.800> time<00:01:28.040> they<00:01:28.160> ever<00:01:28.250> deploy<00:01:28.580> us<00:01:28.730> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the first time they ever deploy us and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.610 
the first time they ever deploy us and
they're<00:01:29.360> going<00:01:29.480> from<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> small<00:01:30.470> business

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
they're going from a small business

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.010 
they're going from a small business
server<00:01:31.040> potentially<00:01:31.700> or<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:32.600> regular<00:01:32.960> old

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020

standalone servers the shared storage

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.120 
standalone servers the shared storage
piece<00:01:35.720> might<00:01:36.080> be<00:01:36.260> new<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.500> they<00:01:36.740> might<00:01:36.890> think

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
piece might be new and they might think

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.590 
piece might be new and they might think
oh<00:01:37.220> it's<00:01:37.370> it's<00:01:37.580> it's<00:01:37.790> hard<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> do<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:38.420> we

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
oh it's it's it's hard to do but we

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.540 
oh it's it's it's hard to do but we
definitely<00:01:39.170> make<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.380> really<00:01:39.710> easy<00:01:39.740> follow

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
definitely make it really easy follow

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.130 
definitely make it really easy follow
traffic<00:01:40.880> lights<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.360> do<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.600> storage<00:01:41.840> part

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
traffic lights to do the storage part

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.990 
traffic lights to do the storage part
but<00:01:42.500> once<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:42.710> have<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.860> set<00:01:43.070> up<00:01:43.100> Matt<00:01:43.400> it

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
but once you have it set up Matt it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.640 
but once you have it set up Matt it
really<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.420> super<00:01:44.810> easy<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.110> deploy<00:01:45.260> right

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
really is super easy to deploy right
