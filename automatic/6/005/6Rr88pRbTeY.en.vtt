can call it that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.520

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
is is it can really really affect

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
is is it can really really affect
yourself<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.030> organizers<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> reason<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
yourself the organizers have a reason to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
yourself the organizers have a reason to
do<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> respect<00:01:02.489> their<00:01:02.640> decision<00:01:03.090> why

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
do that so I respect their decision why

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.240 
do that so I respect their decision why
do<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> organizers<00:01:04.710> did<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
do you think the organizers did that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.660 
do you think the organizers did that
this<00:01:06.119> year<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> contest<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.710> how

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this year the contest is more about how

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.550 
this year the contest is more about how
you<00:01:08.729> carry<00:01:09.060> yourself<00:01:09.150> how<00:01:09.900> knowledgeable<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you carry yourself how knowledgeable you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
you carry yourself how knowledgeable you
are<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> maybe<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.180> felt<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.409> know

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
are so maybe they felt that you know

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.609 
are so maybe they felt that you know
having<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.220> body<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:15.619> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
having a good body it's not that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.859 
having a good body it's not that
important<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.430> feel<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> respect

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
important I feel that we have to respect

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
important I feel that we have to respect
the<00:01:18.960> organizers<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.220> say

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the organizers and what they have to say

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
the organizers and what they have to say
because<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.540> everybody<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> chance

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
because I think everybody has a chance

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
because I think everybody has a chance
to<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.520> part<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.150> beginning<00:01:24.509> Simon

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to be part of the beginning Simon

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
to be part of the beginning Simon
especially<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.610> come

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
especially like for now we actually come

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
especially like for now we actually come
to<00:01:26.909> wavehouse<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.229> very

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to wavehouse which i think is so very

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
to wavehouse which i think is so very
good<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.189> matches<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.299> example

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
good because it matches like for example

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
good because it matches like for example
you<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.840> Beach<00:01:31.079> where<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.650> going

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you are in Beach where and then going

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
you are in Beach where and then going
wave<00:01:32.100> house<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> totally<00:01:33.119> matches<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
wave house so it totally matches the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.850 
wave house so it totally matches the
whole<00:01:33.840> thing<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.829> be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
whole thing so I don't think it would be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.330 
whole thing so I don't think it would be
something<00:01:35.460> really

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
something really

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.090 
something really
not<00:01:37.179> good<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.659> think<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.649> was<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.829> very

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
not good I think that that was a very

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.240 
not good I think that that was a very
wise<00:01:39.429> move<00:01:39.759> because<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:41.500> don't<00:01:41.859> want<00:01:42.159> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
wise move because we don't want to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.700 
wise move because we don't want to
follow<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:43.149> rest<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.780> competitions<00:01:44.439> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
follow the rest of the competitions and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.849 
follow the rest of the competitions and
previous<00:01:45.490> competitions<00:01:46.119> in<00:01:46.560> previous<00:01:47.560> years

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
previous competitions in previous years

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.270 
previous competitions in previous years
I<00:01:48.130> think<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.530> having<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.740> separate<00:01:51.159> event

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
I think that having a separate event

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.699 
I think that having a separate event
like<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.880> beach<00:01:52.060> way<00:01:52.299> then<00:01:52.600> it's<00:01:53.259> actually<00:01:53.409> a

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
like the beach way then it's actually a

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.190 
like the beach way then it's actually a
very<00:01:53.860> good<00:01:54.069> idea<00:01:54.219> and<00:01:54.909> do<00:01:55.600> they<00:01:55.780> find<00:01:56.020> the

separate them you would have the the
segment<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.150> wouldn't<00:03:04.389> be<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.569> part<00:03:04.930> of

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079

segment in but it wouldn't be a part of
the<00:03:05.260> competition<00:03:05.620> yes<00:03:07.169> it<00:03:08.169> would<00:03:08.669> well<00:03:09.669> if<00:03:09.880> the

the model is beauty with a purpose then

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.990 
the model is beauty with a purpose then

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
purpose and beauty does not necessarily

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.589 
purpose and beauty does not necessarily
be<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:20.019> know<00:03:20.250> wavy<00:03:21.250> curvy<00:03:21.639> body<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.359> things

be you know wavy curvy body and things

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.099 
be you know wavy curvy body and things
like<00:03:22.750> this

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
like this

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.020 
like this
well<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.319> wouldn't<00:03:23.739> say<00:03:23.889> that<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.099> want<00:03:24.819> either

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
well I wouldn't say that I want either

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.059 
well I wouldn't say that I want either
one<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.470> for<00:03:26.919> every

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
one because I think that for every

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.830 
one because I think that for every
segment<00:03:27.400> they<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:28.120> your<00:03:28.299> reasons<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.690> doing

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
segment they have your reasons for doing

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.530 
segment they have your reasons for doing
so<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.889> I<00:03:29.919> think<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.430> think<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.730> facility<00:03:31.359> eat

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
so so I think I think that facility eat

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.390 
so so I think I think that facility eat
they<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.989> this

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
they do this

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.970 
they do this
drop<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.599> maybe<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.470> they<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
drop it because maybe like they have it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.009 
drop it because maybe like they have it
not<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.670> separate<00:03:36.060> segment<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.569> for<00:03:36.959> example

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
not a separate segment like for example

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:37.550 
not a separate segment like for example
today

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
today

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.100 
today
gyrate<00:03:38.040> house<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.579> think<00:03:38.879> it's<00:03:38.970> fairly<00:03:39.269> fine<00:03:39.510> if

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
gyrate house I think it's fairly fine if

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.720 
gyrate house I think it's fairly fine if
you<00:03:40.379> were<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.799> charge<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.159> it<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.549> had<00:03:41.700> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you were in charge of it and you had a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.789 
you were in charge of it and you had a
choice<00:03:41.970> would<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:42.599> include<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.439> somewhere

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
choice would you include the somewhere

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.899 
choice would you include the somewhere
section<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.549> competition<00:03:46.250> maybe<00:03:47.250> like<00:03:47.640> a

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
section in the competition maybe like a

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.720 
section in the competition maybe like a
private<00:03:48.510> event<00:03:48.629> but<00:03:49.500> then<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.920> wouldn't<00:03:50.519> really

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
private event but then I wouldn't really

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.530 
private event but then I wouldn't really
take<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.359> into<00:03:51.750> account<00:03:51.780> when<00:03:52.260> choosing<00:03:52.319> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
take that into account when choosing the
