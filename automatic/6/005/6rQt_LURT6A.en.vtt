whatever
still<00:02:57.700> fairly<00:02:58.120> decent<00:02:58.600> figure<00:02:59.130> I<00:03:00.360> think<00:03:01.360> he

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
still fairly decent figure I think he

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.460 
still fairly decent figure I think he
could<00:03:01.570> been<00:03:01.720> made<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.960> little<00:03:02.230> better<00:03:02.620> though

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
could been made a little better though

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.800 
could been made a little better though
but<00:03:05.470> uh<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:06.090> kind<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.120> wish<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.360> could<00:03:07.480> get<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.630> new

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
brogre damn it but I do like this figure

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.240 
brogre damn it but I do like this figure
it's<00:03:21.610> not<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.060> best<00:03:22.360> figure<00:03:22.840> I've<00:03:23.410> ever<00:03:23.620> seen

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
