00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 Today we are all about to order the wurst 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.080
 the liverwurst only this time is not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.219
 liver in it 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.599
 this time it's a vegan liverwurst 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.120
 I think it's a little bit anyway 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.730
 doubtful or unappetizing itself 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 a detoxification organs somewhere on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
 to smear bread 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.760
 and that's why we'll get you today 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 these paths introduce all variants for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.119
 it is always something vegan 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.689
 problematic what am I doing 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.329
 bread as more rettig cucumber tomato or 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 Radishes also become more and more with time 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.300
 bit boring the finished products 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 which are there are usually very expensive 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 Often have the disadvantage that there 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.820
 just also additives 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 preservatives glutamate 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.809
 yeast extract are processed as well 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.920
 And that's not really what we're talking about 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.469
 of the inventor 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.899
 So we try our best 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.210
 possibility to do everything yourself because 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.789
 We also believe vegan life 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 must be affordable and so tasty 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.040
 We will taste it and we will get started 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
 you now indeed the one or the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 other recipe introduce the vegan 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 liver sausage you have two options 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 to eat these 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
 but if you just got out of the pan 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 then it fits perfectly 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.360
 boiled potatoes and can be eaten as a dip 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.250
 become 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.729
 I was told that she then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 something like piece of short tastes like me 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.430
 the preferred thing is the liverwurst time 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 Remove from the pan and put in a glass 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.659
 to fill and then to cool 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 put in the refrigerator overnight 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.729
 The palm fat used will then stop 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.479
 firm and it creates a spreadable 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 Let's talk for a long time 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:55.700
 get to the sausage and purely in the kitchen 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:02:00.259
 the ingredients 70 coconut fat three small ones 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.680
 onions 220 liters a vegetable 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.909
 bun yeast two tablespoons 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.360
 Oatmeal for tablespoons breadcrumbs 1 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:18.830
 tablespoons of marjoram pepper coriander 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.410
 ginger and must be the first 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.019
 naturally cut skinned onions 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.019
 and processed into small cubes 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 So here we have the flag there 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.000
 Now we put our coconut fat in and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.000
 let that melt nice and cozy 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.640
 when it's hot the onions come 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.640
 to 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:01.610
 and we leave that pretty glassy 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.610
 By the way , we put the broth on 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.590
 and now they are crumbling into it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.130
 It's a bit faster 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.810
 and also much easier than if 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.660
 to make the whole chunk dates hein 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.400
 so we would naturally fit in the way 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.970
 continue on the onions on that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.480
 that burn me and with that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.760
 whisk is now help nice 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.290
 stirred into the broth until they are 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.459
 completely triggers and once briefly 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.560
 Boil 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.290
 so now we take the whole from the stove 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.950
 Give to the broth with the yeast 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.950
 onions 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.330
 and now oatmeal is added 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.750
 they are beautifully intermixed now 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.750
 breadcrumbs 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.960
 and the marjoram mix everything nicely 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.820
 so and now we still give the spices 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:11.020
 to 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:13.210
 mustard ginger i have of course now 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.640
 about how much I put in there 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.630
 You always have to do that in between 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.609
 to taste 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.720
 if we take as a bit more 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:28.060
 would like or a little less then 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.020
 come coriander to it all always nice 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.760
 mix in 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.760
 in between, maybe try 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.390
 so now comes a decent pinch 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:47.040
 Add pepper and then we leave that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:53.320
 Bring it all together again 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.490
 that would be all there 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.850
 we have a nice one now 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.670
 Potatoes and there we go now 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:06.760
 the liverwurst as a tip on it is supposed 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:12.670
 taste like pieces short like that and now 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.620
 I feel the rest in a glass the whole 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.680
 Let cool as nice and then on 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.660
 best with over night or it comes then 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.910
 anyway in the fridge with it 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.370
 firmly becomes a spreadable mass 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.170
 good appetite and we hope we have 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.410
 a little variety on the plate 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.410
 brought
