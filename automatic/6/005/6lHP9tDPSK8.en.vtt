really want gloves I don't know what I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.780 
really want gloves I don't know what I
was<00:02:26.560> thinking<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:27.070> told<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> didn't<00:02:27.730> know

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
was thinking I told you I didn't know

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.780 
was thinking I told you I didn't know
what<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> was<00:02:28.090> doing<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:30.280> once<00:02:30.549> you've<00:02:30.700> rung

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
what I was doing now once you've rung

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.250 
what I was doing now once you've rung
out<00:02:30.940> all<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> water<00:02:31.299> then<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.989> kind<00:02:32.109> of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
out all the water then you can kind of

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.400 
out all the water then you can kind of
shake<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.570> start<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.109> design

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
shake it out and start to see the design

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.229 
shake it out and start to see the design
of<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> colors<00:02:35.950> really<00:02:36.130> saturated<00:02:36.820> when<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
of the colors really saturated when the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.960 
of the colors really saturated when the
fabrics<00:02:37.780> still<00:02:37.989> wet<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.920> already<00:02:39.430> liked<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
fabrics still wet but I already liked it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
fabrics still wet but I already liked it
so<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.510> really<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.049> way<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.290> turned<00:02:41.500> out

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
so I really like the way this turned out

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.949 
so I really like the way this turned out
so<00:02:41.980> far<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.209> once<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> dries<00:02:43.720> it's

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
so far I know that once it dries it's

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.330 
so far I know that once it dries it's
going<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.200> get<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.350> little<00:02:44.470> softer<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.160> color

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
going to get a little softer the color

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.539 
going to get a little softer the color
and<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.730> like<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.600> muted<00:02:47.079> hues<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.370> home

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
and I like the muted hues but if at home

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.610 
and I like the muted hues but if at home
if<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.819> want<00:02:49.000> something<00:02:49.180> that's<00:02:49.359> more<00:02:49.690> bold

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
if you want something that's more bold

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.800 
if you want something that's more bold
or<00:02:50.980> makes<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.400> bigger<00:02:51.730> statement<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.569> just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
or makes a bigger statement then just

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.870 
or makes a bigger statement then just
saturate<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.739> fabric<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> color<00:02:54.549> for<00:02:54.819> a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
saturate the fabric in the color for a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.309 
saturate the fabric in the color for a
little<00:02:55.000> bit<00:02:55.150> longer<00:02:55.389> and<00:02:55.720> then<00:02:55.780> you're<00:02:56.230> going

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
little bit longer and then you're going

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.650 
little bit longer and then you're going
to<00:02:56.410> get<00:02:56.530> bolder<00:02:57.069> hues<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.510> something<00:02:58.510> that's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
to get bolder hues and something that's

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.449 
to get bolder hues and something that's
more<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> statement<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.769> we're<00:02:59.950> finished<00:03:00.280> up

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
more of a statement so we're finished up

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.330 
more of a statement so we're finished up

project like this is it has so many uses
okay<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:21.069> obviously<00:03:21.310> use<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.239> on<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
okay so you can obviously use it on a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.539 
couch or a sofa or even the back of a
chair<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.840> it'll<00:03:26.019> add<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.200> lot<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.530> color<00:03:27.189> to
