00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
don't even go get and what I've done is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.650 
don't even go get and what I've done is
use<00:02:37.810> sour<00:02:38.170> cream<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:39.340> practically<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.390> same

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
use sour cream it's practically the same

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
use sour cream it's practically the same
thing<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:41.140> just<00:02:41.320> given<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.680> nice<00:02:41.860> base<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> our

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
thing it's just given a nice base to our

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.180 
thing it's just given a nice base to our
marinade<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.170> still<00:02:44.440> all<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.799> in<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
marinade so we can still all this in and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.009 
marinade so we can still all this in and
ideally<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.299> should<00:02:46.359> be<00:02:46.540> left<00:02:46.690> overnight

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
ideally this should be left overnight

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.289 
ideally this should be left overnight
for<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> flavors<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.130> work<00:02:48.280> through<00:02:48.609> but<00:02:49.180> if

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
for the flavors to work through but if

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.520 
for the flavors to work through but if
you're<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> rush<00:02:49.600> on<00:02:49.989> this

really important that our pan is really
warm<00:04:00.190> really<00:04:00.730> hot<00:04:00.970> because<00:04:01.510> we're<00:04:01.660> going<00:04:01.780> to

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
warm really hot because we're going to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.569 
warm really hot because we're going to
cook<00:04:01.930> our<00:04:02.049> chicken<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.769> lightly<00:04:03.040> oil<00:04:03.400> it

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.449 
cook our chicken so just lightly oil it
and<00:04:03.760> stick<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.390> our<00:04:04.829> chicken<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:06.160> we've<00:04:06.310> made

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and stick in our chicken that we've made

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.240 
and stick in our chicken that we've made
earlier<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.930> sizzle<00:04:08.290> animal<00:04:08.560> carry<00:04:09.160> on

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
earlier a little sizzle animal carry on

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.610 
earlier a little sizzle animal carry on
but<00:04:09.790> just<00:04:09.850> cook<00:04:10.269> it<00:04:10.299> until<00:04:10.780> your<00:04:11.019> chicken<00:04:11.500> is

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
but just cook it until your chicken is

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.979 
but just cook it until your chicken is
nice<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.010> tender<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:13.360> shouldn't<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.780> too<00:04:13.959> long

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
nice and tender it shouldn't be too long

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.130 
nice and tender it shouldn't be too long
roughly<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.799> 10<00:04:15.610> minutes<00:04:15.850> on<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> medium<00:04:16.720> to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
roughly about 10 minutes on a medium to

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.199 
roughly about 10 minutes on a medium to
high<00:04:17.289> heat<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.829> once<00:04:18.579> we're<00:04:18.729> done<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:18.970> we

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
high heat and once we're done this we

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.969 
high heat and once we're done this we
can<00:04:19.359> also<00:04:19.660> take<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.140> chicken<00:04:20.440> off<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.680> heat

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
can also take the chicken off the heat

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.370 
can also take the chicken off the heat
and<00:04:21.100> just<00:04:21.459> let<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.789> as<00:04:21.910> put<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.419> aside<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.960> we

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and just let it as put it aside and we

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.080 
and just let it as put it aside and we
can<00:04:23.530> work<00:04:23.710> on<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.010> remainder<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.850> sauce

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
can work on the remainder of the sauce

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.529 
can work on the remainder of the sauce
so<00:04:25.360> we<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.570> check<00:04:25.780> in<00:04:25.960> our<00:04:26.200> chicken<00:04:26.530> later

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
so we can check in our chicken later

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.480 
so we can check in our chicken later
okay<00:04:28.539> now<00:04:29.289> I'm<00:04:29.350> going<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.560> stick<00:04:29.800> our<00:04:30.070> onions
