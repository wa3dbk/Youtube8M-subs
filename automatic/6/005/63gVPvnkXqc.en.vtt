00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hi I am a multitool 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.730
 naturally very handy for small ones 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.950
 chores 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.529
 but you always have a cord or something 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.160
 not in this review we look at the 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:23.240
 bosch pmf 10 points 8 lithium ion 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.339
 without a cord so they took the Bosch PMF 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.749
 10 points 8 lithium ion from the 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.949
 packaging from the coolblue 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.439
 We have come to a box 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.620
 another nice suitcase and that is this one 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
 hard plastic case from bosch ideal 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.860
 to put things away and also the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.300
 not to lose accessories that are 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.520
 there is quite a few 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.590
 because here you can of course see the multi-tool 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.180
 yourself but here you see the charging station 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.820
 what you need for you this 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.260
 lithium-ion battery is not a reserve 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.570
 maybe lithium-ion battery 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 is 10 idea if you do a lot of odd jobs 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.230
 and a very often used one by one 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.629
 to be purchased extra 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.640
 the charging time is over an hour and here 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.859
 another tool for this shed 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.839
 pieces have the shed papers that 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.460
 have an extra layer and this 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.110
 key is important because with what 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.110
 key we can do the tool shed 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.590
 well if we then this one 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.329
 bosch pmf team point 8 lithium ion de 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.610
 seven of them will look closer 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.070
 nice compact device is easy 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.560
 hand has soft-grip and very solid 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 here is the on / off button here are then 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.110
 according to a button with which we therefore 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.299
 yet 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.520
 practically stepless as a relationship 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.130
 adjust and a special eco-position 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.659
 for a longer duration of the battery 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 to the battery that is in the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.850
 back this you get at 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.630
 delivered 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.950
 and if you did it Hulk Nick does it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.630
 well then it is ready 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.549
 you only need to use it 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.899
 just have to turn this button on 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.850
 you watch out because he gets up 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.560
 voltage when delivered 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.560
 never becomes a desk 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.610
 and what's funny will be him again 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.380
 but you probably saw it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.400
 an orange light will illuminate here 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.320
 see you here 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.729
 gas tank you stand well I think so 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.580
 funny of forest because it goes natural 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.920
 really about a lithium-ion battery 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.810
 this is the indication of how full it is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
 the on-off button and here it is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.380
 then with a key that 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.000
 key is included 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.310
 you can then do this piece 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 replace it with another accessory such as 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.550
 a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.650
 and sanding stiff or for example 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.130
 a grinder it or you another handy 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 bag 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.030
 so you do that here and in the village for a moment 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.610
 turn it off 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.350
 next thing with key 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.590
 make sure you don't lose with a key 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.590
 hit 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.890
 the nice thing about bosch products is that they 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.760
 of course be extensively tested and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.500
 that will be the future with one 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.200
 quality brand 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.120
 also taking this forest into use 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.420
 pmf 10 points 8 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.950
 lithium ion has been extensively tested and that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.950
 see you in this video 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.990
 it is a multi two a nice extraordinary 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.910
 handy for small jobs in places 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.840
 where you normally can't go 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.130
 but if for example you do a lot 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.940
 want to create meters with for example 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.290
 grinding 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.610
 yes , of course, he can't 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850
 compete with for example one 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.850
 grinding wheel 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.150
 the ability to connect it to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.650
 remove a substance 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.420
 is of course extremely handy with 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.430
 especially in those spaces where you actually 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.430
 would rather not have any dust at all 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.110
 do you have all kinds of chores to do on one 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.250
 place where you don't have a power outlet and 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.320
 those chores include things that this one 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.360
 multitool 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.470
 yes then the bosch pmf team is point 8 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.230
 lithium ion 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.600
 a very good solution so you want this one 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.380
 bosch pmf 10 can use 8 lithium ion 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.760
 of course you go to 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.610
 powertoolshop.nl or b 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.840
 also take a look at our interesting 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.850
 accessory sets as bundle offer 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.270
 thanks for looking happy to the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.270
 next review
