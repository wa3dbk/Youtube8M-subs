00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.400
 staff speaks're starting another tone 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.130
 well in the kitchen today we will 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 to make a caprese salad in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.370
 Mass filo baskets calm there not 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 scare stay with us 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.949
 You'll understand this one from here. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 This pasta is very used in the kitchen. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 Turkish and you think in good supermarket 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 it's several sheets that's how you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 find her and we the first thing 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 we will do we will 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.489
 separate the leaves and we will work 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.700
 from sheet to sheet then you will pick up 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 a leaf and basically we're going 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.059
 start working it we will 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 cut her framed 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.520
 approximately 10 by 10 centimeters 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.270
 So we'll start by cutting this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270
 sheet to 1 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.989
 and before we cut the square we'll go 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.330
 spend our olive oil to stay longer 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.340
 easy here so just get a brush if 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.470
 you do not have a brush if you can pass 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.390
 with your hand or a napkin 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.789
 enough care and we are 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.159
 using olive oil here 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.289
 I've seen this recipe with butter and 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.690
 also with the egg but I think that with 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.850
 olive oil is a little better 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.310
 so just go through everything and now 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.229
 people will cut back to form the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.200
 our squares 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.840
 basically every basket that people 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.009
 We're going to use four 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 little squares 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.770
 so just get a drink here 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.229
 people are wearing an ivory goblet 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.840
 if you can use a shape that is 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.520
 It does not have to be this way, and you 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.009
 will put one by one 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.159
 if any dough suddenly cracks or 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.220
 Breaking, no problem, just putting 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.440
 and you can use it and from 4 you can 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.959
 have to use more if you want it 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.869
 stay a little thicker the basket 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.629
 You can use more pasta then 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.989
 let's do one more for you to see there is 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.979
 only put of a none until making the 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.800
 basket 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.860
 now you will take the oven to 180 degrees 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.319
 preheated for five minutes is fine 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.989
 fast does not leave much because otherwise it will 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.420
 burn and this is the result that is the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.920
 Our basket is pretty cool, we can 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 stuff with whatever you want 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.900
 and here we will leave with a salad 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.220
 caprese we will start by cutting the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.510
 our tomatoes 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 here we are using that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.290
 small tomato non-automatic 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.269
 cherry I think the smaller than I 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.239
 whether we are using various 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.730
 Tomato colors if you find it is more 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.230
 cool looks better if you can not 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.530
 use only the reds 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.120
 so just put the bowl in a bowl 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.190
 people will need basil too 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 You can cut and roughly 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.360
 So how are you? 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.140
 boot in the bowl too and now people 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.519
 will cut our cheese 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.439
 here we are using the mozzarella 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.629
 This one is not the one in here. 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.629
 The water is from here is the one you 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.780
 buying dry can be large or small 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.269
 and we're going to come back here framed 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.569
 also roughly do not need 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.569
 be in a very sharp way 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.290
 and goes to the bowl too and we already 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.510
 can season our salad we'll go 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.280
 put some olive oil 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.620
 I do not want the salad to be too much. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.810
 wet because otherwise you will not combine 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.150
 much with the basket I put a 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.700
 a little bit of salt put a little 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.790
 ground pepper and you can also 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.490
 put the balsamic vinegar here to people 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.600
 I did not want to add more 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.510
 and it's just a good move and that's your 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.550
 Caprese salad is very easy to make has 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.090
 several ways to do this is a way 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.330
 that we like and just put 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.280
 It's very cool in your baskets. 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.160
 recipe you can eat with the same hand 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.340
 it is even easier to eat with your hand and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.880
 It is very tasty and also 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.590
 crunchy 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.740
