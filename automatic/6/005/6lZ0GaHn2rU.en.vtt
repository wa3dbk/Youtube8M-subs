00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
requirements which is clearly not enough

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.920

as<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.310> tests<00:02:43.520> show<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.600> therefore

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
as the tests show it is therefore

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.870 
as the tests show it is therefore

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
important that the European Union

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
important that the European Union

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
develops more stringent safety

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520
