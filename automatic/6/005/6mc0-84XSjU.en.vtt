00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 people are going to try it so it looks good 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.649

 It started here on the TV I have on 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.250
 my head at will and I'm sure 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.560
 which will be a success as a program of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.780

 the city sky is a product already 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 consecrated is but we have to have 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.369
 always respecting how he said the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 competition but with a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.240
 it is almost ten years there that the test of 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 fidelity was now here in redetv 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.409
 now it's back and it comes with everything 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 You can advance to people who will have 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.140
 of innovative 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.649
 looks at the finished text in fact it is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.630
 the last he had he left the churchyard in 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.100
 2005 final 2005 in 2005 first 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.170
 place of audience, right? 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.119
 we played a little fun in the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.640
 carnival was in the vice leadership now the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.280
 program even for real is on Saturday 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 about the night after the mega password is that it is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.020
 a very cool to be able to do soon in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.329
 followed by a series of horses that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 comes with a good audience so this is the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.050
 more important that I can help 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.140
 that the program is really very 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.800
 cool, very cool, it's very competitive 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.860
 that I can say 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.430
 is exactly that is controversial as 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 always very controversial, you 're one of the couples 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.750
 who will participate in the first program 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.050
 are married couples are there one of them 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.750
 including two children and is a right 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.450
 really very tense weather very tense 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.940
 will have the one of mine contraction 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.700
 audience the audience hot night up I 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.860
 I think it's all for you. It has everything. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 sure will be a success and you with 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.400
 experience you have to test 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.570
 fidelity both here in brazil and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.210
 abroad 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.160
 Do you think that from here to here in these eight? 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.790
 years the team has been down the network 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.250
 TV 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.710
 people today are more faithful or 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.360
 less faithful to let us now see this 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.190
 I'll experiment now, I'll know who 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.490
 it is more faithful who is less faithful 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.550
 It's nice to see but I think there's been there 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.070
 infidelity or faithfulness is a theme 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.530
 For any age, no, because I say 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.530
 puffs and reaches all the pants 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.150
 rich or poor of all ages 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.700
 infidelity is a controversial issue is a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.910
 theme is very rich, I mean, I had to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.280
 power of happiness and this format 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:29.160
 this program in 2002 aaa right is a theme 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.070
 that is timeless is any time either 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.900
 say already has a new generation which is now 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.500
 with protest unit that was were 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.150
 children or to pre-adolescents who were 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.680
 if the victims were created, the parents did not 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.540
 there were some things that freed the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.070
 but I never see a program in the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.360
 your essence of the beginning middle and end 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.670
 so now let's see with a new 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.830
 Today we have twitter the themes 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.090
 and facebook, what's up, and something else? 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.900
 it is important to say we are 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.120
 tweet there live is all that 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.770
 It's happening and with your help. 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.140
 also from the portal that I think 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.580
 also thank the caring of the portal 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 this is very important without the help of 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.580
 You, too, always find it difficult, I guess. 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.900
 very nice 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.820
 so it will have enough interactivity 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.650
 Now I want to know who wants it. 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.709
