unit for my xbox 360 controllers now

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.200 
unit for my xbox 360 controllers now
this<00:04:51.780> thing's<00:04:52.050> G+<00:04:52.650> brilliant<00:04:53.069> I<00:04:53.280> mean

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
this thing's G+ brilliant I mean

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.969 
this thing's G+ brilliant I mean
obviously<00:04:54.509> I<00:04:54.780> don't<00:04:54.990> take<00:04:55.169> out<00:04:55.409> like<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.800> to

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
obviously I don't take out like this to

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.170 
obviously I don't take out like this to
use<00:04:56.159> it<00:04:56.400> but<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:58.590> one<00:04:58.710> second<00:04:59.069> I<00:05:00.740> mean<00:05:01.740> if<00:05:01.949> I

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
use it but I just one second I mean if I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.330 
use it but I just one second I mean if I
open<00:05:03.180> this<00:05:03.210> up<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.590> controllers<00:05:05.069> are<00:05:05.099> there

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
open this up the controllers are there

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.830 
open this up the controllers are there
now<00:05:05.610> bachelor<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.509> back<00:05:06.629> of<00:05:06.780> the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
now bachelor the back of the

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.969 
now bachelor the back of the
controller's<00:05:07.199> got<00:05:07.409> these<00:05:07.530> little<00:05:07.650> pressure

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
controller's got these little pressure

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.790 
controller's got these little pressure
point<00:05:08.250> these<00:05:08.550> little<00:05:08.789> sensors<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:10.349> when

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
point these little sensors that when

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.149 
point these little sensors that when
that<00:05:10.979> meets<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:11.520> with<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:12.479> sensor<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:14.639> box

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
that meets up with the sensor on the box

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.480 
that meets up with the sensor on the box
so<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:18.270> charges<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.750> controller<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.349> get<00:05:20.310> to

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
so it charges the controller and get to

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.390 
so it charges the controller and get to
in<00:05:20.610> there<00:05:20.789> which<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.330> obviously<00:05:21.599> nice<00:05:22.400> so

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
in there which is obviously nice so

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.379 
in there which is obviously nice so
that's<00:05:23.599> extremely<00:05:24.599> handy<00:05:25.229> days<00:05:26.210> never<00:05:27.210> go

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
that's extremely handy days never go

small<00:05:51.659> but<00:05:51.960> not<00:05:52.319> too<00:05:52.500> small<00:05:52.770> and<00:05:53.639> so<00:05:53.759> it<00:05:53.879> just

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
small but not too small and so it just

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.879 
small but not too small and so it just
looks<00:05:54.180> really<00:05:54.330> nice<00:05:54.539> and<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:55.379> think<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.680> does

now it's on that side because I'm

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.950 
now it's on that side because I'm
right-handed<00:06:36.069> so<00:06:36.759> it's<00:06:37.539> just<00:06:37.720> nice<00:06:37.930> and
