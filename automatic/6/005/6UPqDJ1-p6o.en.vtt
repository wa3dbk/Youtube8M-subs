00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.069 
it making it for free in the 77th minute
but<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> generally<00:03:14.970> thought<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.390> could<00:03:15.600> hold<00:03:15.810> on

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
but I generally thought I could hold on

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.849 
but I generally thought I could hold on
and<00:03:16.290> keep<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.489> victory<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.209> our<00:03:18.600> hands<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.350> was

and keep the victory in our hands I was

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.890 
and keep the victory in our hands I was
totally<00:03:20.100> incorrect<00:03:20.639> because<00:03:21.299> yet<00:03:21.600> again<00:03:21.630> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
totally incorrect because yet again I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.750 
totally incorrect because yet again I
pulled<00:03:22.260> defenders<00:03:22.709> out<00:03:22.829> left<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.190> massive<00:03:23.370> gap
