00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680

think<00:00:25.890> has<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.099> Redskins<00:00:26.849> minus<00:00:27.269> 1<00:00:27.480> heavily

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
think has the Redskins minus 1 heavily

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.339 
think has the Redskins minus 1 heavily
juiced<00:00:28.500> up<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.920> minus<00:00:29.250> 1<00:00:29.429> 33<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.349> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
juiced up to like minus 1 33 or so the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.990 
juiced up to like minus 1 33 or so the
browns<00:00:31.590> though<00:00:31.800> they've<00:00:32.040> won<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:32.610> games<00:00:32.790> in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
browns though they've won three games in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
browns though they've won three games in
a<00:00:33.120> row<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.230> know

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a row and they actually you know

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
sure what to think here the thing about

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
sure what to think here the thing about
this<00:00:39.180> game<00:00:39.390> though<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.930> Kirk<00:00:40.140> Cousins

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this game though is that if Kirk Cousins

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.040 
this game though is that if Kirk Cousins
is<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.920> who<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.730> start<00:00:42.210> he's<00:00:42.840> been

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is the one who has to start he's been

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
is the one who has to start he's been
pretty<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.559> year<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.640> I'm

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pretty good this year so you know I'm

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
pretty good this year so you know I'm
not<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.450> huge<00:00:45.930> drop<00:00:46.170> down<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
not sure that's a huge drop down for the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650 
not sure that's a huge drop down for the
Redskins<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.640> almost<00:00:48.030> an<00:00:48.149> advantage

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
Redskins and it's almost an advantage

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
Redskins and it's almost an advantage
because<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.620> Browns<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.340> who

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
because the Browns don't know who

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.100 
because the Browns don't know who
they're<00:00:50.910> gonna<00:00:51.000> face<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.930> won't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
they're gonna face you know they won't

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
they're gonna face you know they won't
have<00:00:52.230> much<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> being

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have much you know in the way of being

able to prepare for cousins if he is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.069

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
know I would love to take the Redskins

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.680 
know I would love to take the Redskins
here<00:00:59.550> except<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> Browns<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
here except the Browns have kind of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.000 
here except the Browns have kind of
impressed<00:01:00.989> over<00:01:01.230> recent<00:01:01.410> weeks<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.890> not

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
impressed over recent weeks so I'm not

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.460 
impressed over recent weeks so I'm not
sure<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.820> game<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
sure what do you think about this game I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.750 
sure what do you think about this game I
think<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> Browns<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
think the Browns would actually want to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.170 
think the Browns would actually want to
see<00:01:05.909> rg3<00:01:06.600> yeah<00:01:06.869> after<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.820> he's<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
see rg3 yeah after I think he's going to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
see rg3 yeah after I think he's going to
be<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.570> limited<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.260> definitely

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
be a little limited it's definitely

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200 
be a little limited it's definitely
going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> play<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.220> game<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:12.030> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
going to play in this game I think it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
going to play in this game I think it's
almost<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> certainty<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.229> dad<00:01:13.439> came<00:01:13.680> out

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
almost a certainty as dad came out

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
almost a certainty as dad came out
yesterday<00:01:14.010> said<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> fact<00:01:15.060> he<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.810> the

monday<00:01:24.360> night<00:01:24.509> football<00:01:24.540> game<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.380> weeks<00:01:25.590> ago

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
monday night football game two weeks ago

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
monday night football game two weeks ago
and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.670> fact<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.970> jon<00:01:27.270> gruden<00:01:27.659> says<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and the fact that jon gruden says that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
and the fact that jon gruden says that
they<00:01:28.200> need<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> protect<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.070> kid<00:01:29.340> he's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
they need to protect this kid he's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
they need to protect this kid he's
taking<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> lot<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> hit<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> tells

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
taking a lot of hit but what that tells

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
taking a lot of hit but what that tells
me<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> they're<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
me is they're not going to do that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
me is they're not going to do that
spread<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> option<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
spread the option as much on the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.770 
spread the option as much on the
offensive<00:01:35.850> end<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.180> don't<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.750> should

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
offensive end I don't think they should

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.069 
offensive end I don't think they should
and<00:01:37.380> also<00:01:37.950> he's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> rookie<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.810> more

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and also he's a rookie but more

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
and also he's a rookie but more
importantly<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.159> offense<00:01:41.640> Peter

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
importantly for that offense Peter

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
importantly for that offense Peter
they've<00:01:42.420> gotten<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> lot<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.229> mileage<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
they've gotten a lot of mileage out of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
they've gotten a lot of mileage out of
the<00:01:44.009> rookie<00:01:44.369> running<00:01:44.579> back<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the rookie running back but he is a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.069 
the rookie running back but he is a
rookie<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.130> he's<00:01:47.579> also<00:01:47.850> set<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.600> franchise

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
rookie and he's also set a franchise

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.190 
rookie and he's also set a franchise
record<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> amount<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.460> carries<00:01:50.850> he<00:01:51.000> does

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
record for the amount of carries he does

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.460 
record for the amount of carries he does
he's<00:01:52.200> had<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.619> season<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> as

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
he's had this season so I see this as

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
he's had this season so I see this as
potentially<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.680> Browns<00:01:56.430> hit<00:01:56.850> him<00:01:56.969> quickly<00:01:57.450> at

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
potentially a Browns hit him quickly at

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.749 
potentially a Browns hit him quickly at
the<00:01:58.320> beginning<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> Redskins<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.670> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
what do you think about I know that a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.619 
what do you think about I know that a
total<00:02:11.550> hasn't<00:02:11.819> come<00:02:11.910> out<00:02:12.000> yet<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> think

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
total hasn't come out yet do you think

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.790 
total hasn't come out yet do you think
that<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.959> likely<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.379> be<00:02:13.410> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that it's likely to be a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410 
that it's likely to be a
a<00:02:13.860> high<00:02:14.220> total<00:02:14.460> or<00:02:14.670> low<00:02:14.820> total<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.270> about

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
a high total or low total what about

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.250 
a high total or low total what about
maybe<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.720> Browns<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> teaser<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:18.260> Browns

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
maybe the Browns on a teaser the Browns

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
maybe the Browns on a teaser the Browns
on<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> teeth<00:02:19.770> bird<00:02:20.130> could<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.240> play

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
on a teeth bird could be the right play

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.150 
on a teeth bird could be the right play
here<00:02:21.810> because<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.200> don't<00:02:22.740> think<00:02:22.830> you're

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
here because I don't think you're

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.950 
here because I don't think you're
getting<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.520> amount<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> value<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.600> you

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
getting the amount of value that you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.540 
getting the amount of value that you
normally<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.710> Browns<00:02:26.070> because

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
normally would on the Browns because

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
normally would on the Browns because
they've<00:02:26.760> had<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> winning<00:02:27.240> streak<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.870> right

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
they've had a winning streak here right

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
they've had a winning streak here right
both<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.740> really<00:02:29.040> set<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.580> basically

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
both is really set up as basically

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600 
both is really set up as basically
mirror<00:02:30.900> images<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> each<00:02:31.650> other<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.220> terms<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
mirror images of each other in terms of

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
mirror images of each other in terms of
past<00:02:32.850> performances<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> Redskins

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
past performances I think the Redskins

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440 
past performances I think the Redskins
have<00:02:35.010> had<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> better<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> stronger

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
have had the better of it in a stronger

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.780 
have had the better of it in a stronger
schedule<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.710> could<00:02:38.010> definitely<00:02:38.250> teaser

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
schedule so you could definitely teaser

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.080 
schedule so you could definitely teaser
him<00:02:39.120> here<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.710> for<00:02:40.710> over-under<00:02:41.400> I'm<00:02:41.520> not<00:02:41.760> quite

him here I for over-under I'm not quite

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.200 
him here I for over-under I'm not quite
sure<00:02:42.470> rg3<00:02:43.470> gotta<00:02:43.920> read<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:44.700> bit<00:02:44.880> more<00:02:45.090> on

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
sure rg3 gotta read a little bit more on

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.670 
sure rg3 gotta read a little bit more on
what<00:02:45.390> he's<00:02:45.540> able<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> practice

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
what he's able to do on the practice
