00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
all right so anybody who's made their

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.209 
all right so anybody who's made their
own<00:00:09.660> cabs<00:00:09.990> before<00:00:10.440> knows<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.920> there's<00:00:11.099> an

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
own cabs before knows that there's an

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.060 
own cabs before knows that there's an
art<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.550> putting<00:00:11.580> till<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.150> song<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:13.259> easy

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
art to putting till like song it's easy

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.279 
art to putting till like song it's easy
it's<00:00:14.400> upholstery<00:00:14.969> yeah<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.960> ain't<00:00:16.080> easy

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it's upholstery yeah and it ain't easy

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.330 
it's upholstery yeah and it ain't easy
so<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.039> these<00:00:17.190> pre-cut<00:00:17.550> dyes<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:19.340> will

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
so we have these pre-cut dyes that will

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
so we have these pre-cut dyes that will
cut<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.240> piece<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.570> vinyl<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.180> approximate

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
cut a piece of vinyl to the approximate

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
cut a piece of vinyl to the approximate
size<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.529> fit<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> cab<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.130> they're<00:00:26.490> going

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
size to fit the cab that they're going

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
size to fit the cab that they're going
to<00:00:26.640> try<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.910> wrap<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.710> they'll<00:00:28.859> go<00:00:28.949> ahead<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to try and wrap so they'll go ahead and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
to try and wrap so they'll go ahead and
lay<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> dye<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.910> table<00:00:30.330> lay<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.320> vinyl

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
lay the dye on the table lay some vinyl

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.910 
lay the dye on the table lay some vinyl
on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> dye<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.510> lay<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.440> giant<00:00:34.800> piece

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
on the dye and then lay this giant piece

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
on the dye and then lay this giant piece
of<00:00:34.950> breadboard<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.880> top<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> roll<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of breadboard here on top and roll it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020 
of breadboard here on top and roll it
through<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.140> press<00:00:37.410> machine<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.790> will

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
through this press machine and that will

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.950 
through this press machine and that will
give<00:00:39.480> us<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:40.320> approximate<00:00:40.739> cut<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
give us an approximate cut for what is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.479 
give us an approximate cut for what is
attempting<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.280> wrapped<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> moment

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
attempting to be wrapped at the moment

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.549 
attempting to be wrapped at the moment
yeah<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.870> once<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> watch<00:00:49.079> him<00:00:49.260> lay<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
yeah we can once you watch him lay it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
yeah we can once you watch him lay it
out<00:00:49.649> yeah<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.730> does<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:53.360> folds<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
out yeah because he does it folds it in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
out yeah because he does it folds it in
half<00:00:54.750> lays<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.739> sure<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> dye

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
half lays it out make sure the dye

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.680 
half lays it out make sure the dye
covers<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> whole<00:00:56.760> thing

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.570 

these<00:01:04.690> edges<00:01:05.050> are<00:01:05.260> sharp<00:01:05.320> kids<00:01:06.130> do<00:01:06.370> not<00:01:06.520> try

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
these edges are sharp kids do not try

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.350 
these edges are sharp kids do not try
this<00:01:06.850> at<00:01:07.030> home<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.540> don't<00:01:08.320> know<00:01:08.500> about<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.800> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.750 

so<00:01:13.360> press<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.720> button<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.410> it's<00:01:15.190> Toll<00:01:15.550> House

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
so press the button and it's Toll House

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:46.050 
so press the button and it's Toll House
cookies<00:01:16.210> out<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.540> other<00:01:16.690> side

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.760 

so<00:01:47.060> there's<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.360> couple<00:01:47.600> more<00:01:47.840> ready<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:48.440> wrap

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
so there's a couple more ready for wrap

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.890 
so there's a couple more ready for wrap
so<00:01:49.640> this<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.030> glue<00:01:50.210> machine<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.780> will

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
so this is the glue machine that will

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.430 
so this is the glue machine that will
administer<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.620> nice<00:01:52.070> even<00:01:52.790> layer<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.360> glue

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:05.499 

across<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.890> piece<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.220> vinyl

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.559 

lay<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.200> out<00:02:06.289> on<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.530> table<00:02:06.770> there<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.569> this

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
lay it out on the table there and this

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.839 
lay it out on the table there and this
is<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.899> crucial<00:02:09.289> part<00:02:09.739> where<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.459> cabinet

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
is the crucial part where the cabinet

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.670 
is the crucial part where the cabinet
has<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.180> be<00:02:11.269> placed<00:02:11.569> in<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.050> starting<00:02:12.470> place

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
has to be placed in the starting place

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.190 
has to be placed in the starting place
exactly<00:02:13.220> where<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.879> supposed<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.330> go<00:02:14.569> he

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
exactly where it's supposed to go he

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.290 
exactly where it's supposed to go he
lays<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:15.830> edge<00:02:16.040> down<00:02:16.310> make<00:02:16.970> sure<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
lays the one edge down make sure that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.600 
lays the one edge down make sure that
front<00:02:17.750> edge<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.080> correct<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:19.069> drop<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> rest

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
front edge is correct we drop the rest

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.780 
front edge is correct we drop the rest
back<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.269> he<00:02:21.170> goes<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.980> fold<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.400> thing<00:02:22.580> all

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
back if he goes to fold the thing all

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.580 
back if he goes to fold the thing all
the<00:02:22.910> way<00:02:22.940> around<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.780> if<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.050> off<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> little

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the way around and if it's off a little

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.839 
the way around and if it's off a little
bit<00:02:24.800> front<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.340> back

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
bit front to back

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.870 
bit front to back
left<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.599> right<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:28.069> don't<00:02:28.459> really<00:02:28.640> get<00:02:28.819> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
left to right you don't really get a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.699 
left to right you don't really get a
second<00:02:29.269> chance<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.630> peel<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.050> off<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.380> try<00:02:30.560> and

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
second chance to peel it off and try and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.680 
second chance to peel it off and try and
replace<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.549> want<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> nice<00:02:32.000> even<00:02:32.480> layer<00:02:32.630> of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
replace it you want a nice even layer of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.650 
replace it you want a nice even layer of
glue<00:02:33.110> all<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.500> way<00:02:33.530> around<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.760> initial

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
glue all the way around so that initial

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.660 
glue all the way around so that initial
placement<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.410> crucial<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.390> then<00:02:39.519> they'll<00:02:40.519> go

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
placement is crucial and then they'll go

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.420 
placement is crucial and then they'll go
ahead<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.630> get<00:02:42.319> some<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.040> settle

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
ahead and and get some of it to settle

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.569 
ahead and and get some of it to settle
down<00:02:44.200> make<00:02:45.200> sure<00:02:45.349> there's<00:02:45.530> no<00:02:45.650> bubbles<00:02:46.040> that

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
down make sure there's no bubbles that

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.289 
down make sure there's no bubbles that
kind<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.940> thing<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.610> bottom<00:02:49.940> seam

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
kind of a thing and then the bottom seam

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.710 
kind of a thing and then the bottom seam
is<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:51.500> very<00:02:52.489> cool<00:02:52.670> part<00:02:52.970> where<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.209> get<00:02:53.390> sort

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
is a very cool part where you get sort

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.960 
is a very cool part where you get sort
of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> hidden<00:02:54.319> seam<00:02:54.799> where<00:02:55.610> they<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.819> make

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
of the hidden seam where they can make

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.449 
of the hidden seam where they can make
it<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.569> butts<00:02:56.870> right<00:02:57.459> right

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it so that it just butts right right

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.900 
it so that it just butts right right
together<00:02:58.720> correctly<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.519> we'll<00:03:01.519> watch<00:03:01.670> that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
together correctly and we'll watch that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.300 
together correctly and we'll watch that
process<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.630> just<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.870> minute

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.589 

makes<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> initial<00:03:11.670> cut<00:03:12.060> all<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.510> way

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
makes the initial cut all the way

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.660 
makes the initial cut all the way
through<00:03:14.780> pulls<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.049> excess<00:03:16.620> piece<00:03:16.860> out<00:03:17.099> pulls

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
through pulls the excess piece out pulls

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.089 
through pulls the excess piece out pulls
the<00:03:17.879> second<00:03:18.420> piece<00:03:18.629> out<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.079> boom<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.890> got<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
the second piece out and boom you got a

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.520 
the second piece out and boom you got a
perfect<00:03:20.370> seam<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:21.689> might<00:03:21.840> want<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.049> zoom<00:03:22.110> in

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
perfect seam you might want to zoom in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.200 
perfect seam you might want to zoom in
on<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.829> scene

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.670 

what<00:03:32.210> seemed<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.720> don't<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.050> seam<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.500> see<00:03:33.650> a

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
what seemed I don't see a seam you see a

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.570 
what seemed I don't see a seam you see a
seam<00:03:33.920> kerosene

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.910 

so<00:03:42.240> again<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.750> heated<00:03:43.080> glue<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.590> guys<00:03:43.740> are

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
so again it's a heated glue the guys are

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.140 
so again it's a heated glue the guys are
working<00:03:44.100> against<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.700> clock<00:03:44.910> with

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
working against the clock with

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.210 
working against the clock with
temperature<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.720> all<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.230> they

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
temperature and all of that and they

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.710 
temperature and all of that and they
just<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.490> an<00:03:47.580> amazing<00:03:47.760> job<00:03:47.970> making<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.510> look

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
just do an amazing job making this look

good these guys are great so we've got

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.210 
good these guys are great so we've got
the<00:03:57.060> various<00:03:57.390> processes<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.260> speakers<00:03:58.950> being

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
the various processes of speakers being

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.390 
the various processes of speakers being
installed<00:03:59.760> into<00:04:00.390> combos<00:04:00.980> chassis<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.190> being

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
installed into combos chassis is being

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.850 
installed into combos chassis is being
installed<00:04:02.700> into<00:04:02.970> heads<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.900> grilles<00:04:04.230> get<00:04:04.560> put

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
installed into heads the grilles get put

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.490 
installed into heads the grilles get put
on<00:04:06.200> logos<00:04:07.340> rear<00:04:08.340> panels<00:04:08.820> its<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.170> where

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
on logos rear panels its this is where

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.680 
on logos rear panels its this is where
basically<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.700> chassis<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.420> saw<00:04:12.600> on

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
basically the chassis that you saw on

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.320 
basically the chassis that you saw on
the<00:04:12.750> other<00:04:12.930> side<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.470> becoming<00:04:13.920> an<00:04:14.220> amplifier

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
the other side are becoming an amplifier

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.610 
the other side are becoming an amplifier
a<00:04:15.360> real<00:04:15.930> live<00:04:16.970> rock-and-roll<00:04:18.000> but<00:04:18.780> kicking

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.540 

so<00:04:24.620> here<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:24.890> have<00:04:25.690> final<00:04:26.690> cab<00:04:26.900> assembly<00:04:27.550> where

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
so here we have final cab assembly where

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.040 
so here we have final cab assembly where
we've<00:04:28.940> taken<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.330> cab<00:04:29.540> that's<00:04:29.750> been<00:04:29.870> covered

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
we've taken a cab that's been covered

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.630 
we've taken a cab that's been covered
with<00:04:30.200> vinyl<00:04:30.560> had<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.950> corners<00:04:31.310> put<00:04:31.520> on

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
with vinyl had the corners put on

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.740 
with vinyl had the corners put on
handles<00:04:32.270> rubber<00:04:32.810> feet<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:35.180> jack<00:04:35.420> plate<00:04:35.630> was

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
handles rubber feet the jack plate was

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.060 
handles rubber feet the jack plate was
pre-installed<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:36.530> he's<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.860> go<00:04:36.950> ahead

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
pre-installed so he's going to go ahead

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.950 
pre-installed so he's going to go ahead
and<00:04:37.190> screw<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.760> place<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:40.780> it'll<00:04:41.780> roll

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
and screw that in place and it'll roll

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.720 
and screw that in place and it'll roll
around<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.500> corner<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.190> get<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> few<00:04:43.700> other

finishing touches like a front grille
and<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:46.010> logo<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.610> then<00:04:47.150> go<00:04:47.300> through<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.540> play

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
and a logo and then go through a play

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.110 
and a logo and then go through a play
test<00:04:47.930> process<00:04:48.380> over<00:04:48.620> here<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.190> as<00:04:49.880> we<00:04:50.000> can

asses on guitar at this point as well

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:36.510 
asses on guitar at this point as well
it's<00:05:12.260> not<00:05:12.380> even<00:05:12.650> fair

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.040 

basically<00:05:37.520> just<00:05:37.849> just<00:05:38.060> making<00:05:38.389> pure<00:05:38.840> noise

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
basically just just making pure noise

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.050 
basically just just making pure noise
like<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.590> really<00:05:40.009> actually<00:05:40.250> gives<00:05:40.910> you<00:05:41.000> a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
like that really actually gives you a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.790 
like that really actually gives you a
good<00:05:41.210> sense<00:05:41.509> of<00:05:41.630> what<00:05:41.810> if<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.080> pots<00:05:42.319> working

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
good sense of what if the pots working

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.200 
good sense of what if the pots working
right<00:05:42.919> or<00:05:42.949> not<00:05:43.160> as<00:05:43.310> opposed<00:05:43.639> to<00:05:43.789> sitting<00:05:44.000> here

and playing a bunch of wrists sometimes

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.830 
and playing a bunch of wrists sometimes
it's<00:05:46.280> hard<00:05:46.460> if<00:05:46.610> you're<00:05:46.729> just<00:05:46.849> whatever<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:50.630> so

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
it's hard if you're just whatever it so

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.300 
it's hard if you're just whatever it so
you<00:05:50.960> don't<00:05:51.110> really<00:05:51.199> hear<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.500> pop<00:05:51.680> if<00:05:52.190> you

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
you don't really hear the pop if you

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.189 
you don't really hear the pop if you
turn<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.610> like<00:05:52.639> that<00:05:52.849> it<00:05:53.060> it<00:05:53.449> gives<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.930> much

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
turn it like that it it gives you a much

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.600 
turn it like that it it gives you a much
better<00:05:54.349> idea<00:05:54.470> of<00:05:54.770> what's<00:05:54.949> going<00:05:55.130> on<00:05:57.610> yeah

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610
