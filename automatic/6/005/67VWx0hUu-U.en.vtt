tales<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> roll<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:30.070> mean<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:31.090> kind<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.360> nice

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
tales on a roll I mean it's kind of nice

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.600 
tales on a roll I mean it's kind of nice
that<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.709> balance<00:03:33.130> but<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> think<00:03:33.520> the

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
that the the balance but I think the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.650 
that the the balance but I think the
balance<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.940> getting<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.239> little<00:03:34.330> messed<00:03:34.540> up

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
balance is getting a little messed up

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.580 
balance is getting a little messed up
now<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.140> beginning<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.530> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
now because in the beginning of the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.900 
now because in the beginning of the
tournament<00:03:36.070> they<00:03:36.310> were<00:03:36.430> getting<00:03:36.580> kind<00:03:36.850> of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
tournament they were getting kind of

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.340 
tournament they were getting kind of
messed<00:03:37.090> up<00:03:37.300> they<00:03:37.480> weren't<00:03:37.720> winning<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.200> stuff

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
messed up they weren't winning and stuff

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.170 
messed up they weren't winning and stuff
like<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.500> then<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.310> started<00:03:39.640> winning<00:03:39.850> but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
like that then they started winning but

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.370 
like that then they started winning but
now<00:03:40.300> it's<00:03:40.480> getting<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.050> point<00:03:41.290> where

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
now it's getting like to the point where

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.590 
now it's getting like to the point where
they<00:03:41.560> just<00:03:41.830> keep<00:03:41.980> winning<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.580> maybe<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.420> need

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
they just keep winning so maybe we need

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.970 
they just keep winning so maybe we need
another<00:03:43.630> acting<00:03:44.200> low<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> moment<00:03:44.800> or

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
another acting low be a moment or

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.380 
another acting low be a moment or
something<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.880> balance<00:03:46.239> things

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
something like that to balance things

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.270
