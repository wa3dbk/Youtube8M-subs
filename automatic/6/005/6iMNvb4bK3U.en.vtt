must admit the average pace is Scott is
87<00:00:40.280> which<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.579> one<00:00:40.699> of<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.789> highest<00:00:40.909> I've<00:00:41.149> ever

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
87 which is one of the highest I've ever

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.389 
87 which is one of the highest I've ever
ever<00:00:41.449> done<00:00:41.659> possibly<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.620> highest<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.100> with

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
ever done possibly the highest and with

a 2.2 million air I think it costs and
overall<00:00:46.039> they<00:00:46.789> just<00:00:47.059> one<00:00:47.179> insane<00:00:47.510> team<00:00:47.749> so

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
overall they just one insane team so

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.720 
overall they just one insane team so
