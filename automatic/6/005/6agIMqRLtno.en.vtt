out how much of the phase you hear but I
think<00:02:53.500> that's<00:02:53.650> kind<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.950> good<00:02:54.190> thing<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
think that's kind of a good thing it

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.130 
think that's kind of a good thing it
just<00:02:56.320> sort<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.740> makes<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.120> subtle<00:02:58.120> sort<00:02:59.050> of

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
just sort of makes it subtle sort of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.170 
just sort of makes it subtle sort of
depth<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> leads<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.000> things

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
depth to the to the leads and things

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.000 
depth to the to the leads and things
like<00:03:01.300> that

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
like that

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:13.910 
like that
