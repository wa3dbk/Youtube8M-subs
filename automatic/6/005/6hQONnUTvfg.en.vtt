00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
pretty disappointed because we didn't

pretty disappointed because we didn't
see<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> new<00:00:09.510> ipod<00:00:09.870> touch<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.679> didn't<00:00:10.920> seem

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.660 
see a new ipod touch and we didn't seem
a<00:00:11.400> new<00:00:11.639> ipod<00:00:11.940> touch<00:00:12.210> when<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> iphone<00:00:13.860> 4s<00:00:14.490> was

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
a new ipod touch when the iphone 4s was

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
a new ipod touch when the iphone 4s was
announced<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> little

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
announced so you know that was a little

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
announced so you know that was a little
disappointing<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.609> usually<00:00:17.970> i<00:00:18.240> mounted

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
disappointing because usually i mounted

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.120 
disappointing because usually i mounted
every<00:00:18.869> time<00:00:19.020> they<00:00:19.170> announced<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.560> new<00:00:19.680> iphone

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
every time they announced a new iphone

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800 
every time they announced a new iphone
so<00:00:20.400> we're<00:00:20.820> probably<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.359> see<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> with

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
ipod touch to have is probably an a 5x

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470 
ipod touch to have is probably an a 5x
processor<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.949> dual-core<00:00:53.610> processor<00:00:54.210> would<00:00:54.300> be

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
processor a dual-core processor would be

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
processor a dual-core processor would be
really<00:00:54.629> nice<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.680> more<00:00:55.860> RAM<00:00:56.160> because

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
really nice and a bit more RAM because

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.920 
really nice and a bit more RAM because
uh<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.680> 256<00:00:58.680> ram<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.930> ipod

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
uh you know the 256 ram in the ipod

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
uh you know the 256 ram in the ipod
touch<00:01:01.109> 4th<00:01:01.410> generation<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
touch 4th generation just you know it's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
touch 4th generation just you know it's
not<00:01:03.149> enough<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.930> uh<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
not enough because uh you know it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
not enough because uh you know it
doesn't<00:01:05.790> handle<00:01:06.090> multitasking<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.930> will

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
doesn't handle multitasking that will

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
doesn't handle multitasking that will
and<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.770> i<00:01:07.799> mean<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and what i mean is that you know it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
and what i mean is that you know it
doesn't<00:01:09.150> keep<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> applications<00:01:10.110> open

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
doesn't keep a lot of applications open

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950 
doesn't keep a lot of applications open
in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> multitasking<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.810> nice

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in the multitasking so it would be nice

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
in the multitasking so it would be nice
to<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.310> RAM

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
to have you know just a bit more RAM

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.020 
to have you know just a bit more RAM
also<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.689> non<00:01:15.930> fingerprint<00:01:16.619> screen<00:01:17.000> because<00:01:18.000> uh

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
also a non fingerprint screen because uh

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
also a non fingerprint screen because uh
I<00:01:18.540> forgot<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.229> call<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.799> oil

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
I forgot what they call it like an oil

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.580 
I forgot what they call it like an oil
phobic<00:01:20.549> screen<00:01:20.850> yeah<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.140> those<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:22.470> be

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
phobic screen yeah so those would be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
phobic screen yeah so those would be
really<00:01:22.740> nice<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.310> only<00:01:23.909> black<00:01:24.150> ipod

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
really nice because only black ipod

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
really nice because only black ipod
touch<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> gets<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
touch it gets you know a lot of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
touch it gets you know a lot of
fingerprints<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.900> even<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> white<00:01:28.229> when

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
fingerprints and even on the white when

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
fingerprints and even on the white when
it<00:01:28.530> still<00:01:28.710> shows<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> fingerprints<00:01:29.759> all

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it still shows a lot of fingerprints all

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
it still shows a lot of fingerprints all
over<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.119> screen<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.100> would

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
over the screen so you know that would

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
over the screen so you know that would
be<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.759> nice<00:01:33.000> improvement<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.960> an

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
be a really nice improvement and also an

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.010 
be a really nice improvement and also an
IPS<00:01:34.530> display<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.880> ipod<00:01:36.570> touch<00:01:36.600> 4th

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
IPS display because the ipod touch 4th

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
IPS display because the ipod touch 4th
generation<00:01:37.229> doesn't<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.070> an<00:01:38.159> IPS<00:01:38.579> display

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
generation doesn't have an IPS display

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
generation doesn't have an IPS display
in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> iphone<00:01:39.869> 4<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.920> be

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in the iphone 4 does so that would be

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770 
in the iphone 4 does so that would be
really<00:01:41.159> nice<00:01:41.400> even<00:01:42.270> though<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
really nice even though they kind of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
really nice even though they kind of
look<00:01:42.930> identical<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.399> for

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
look identical but you know just for

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
look identical but you know just for
viewing<00:01:44.820> angles<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.840> look<00:01:46.049> really

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
viewing angles that would look really

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770 
viewing angles that would look really
nice<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.829> also<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.090> last<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
nice so also the last thing will be the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
nice so also the last thing will be the
camera<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> camera<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> ipod<00:01:50.189> touch

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
camera the camera on the ipod touch

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.969 
camera the camera on the ipod touch
isn't<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> well<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.409> it'd<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.740> nice<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
isn't all that well so it'd be nice if

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
isn't all that well so it'd be nice if
they<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.430> take<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> iphone<00:01:54.299> 4s<00:01:54.750> camera<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
they can take the iphone 4s camera and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
they can take the iphone 4s camera and
put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> into<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> ipod<00:01:56.729> touch<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> would

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
put it into the ipod touch so that would

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170 
put it into the ipod touch so that would
be<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.380> cool<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> guys<00:01:59.880> what
