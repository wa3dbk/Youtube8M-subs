00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to do when we're changing chords is we

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
to do when we're changing chords is we
just<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.230> fingers<00:00:55.590> off<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
kind of reset in our brain and they go

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.490 
kind of reset in our brain and they go
okay<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.500> by

okay well I'm going to do that and by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
okay well I'm going to do that and by
then<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> 20<00:01:02.219> minutes<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.730> passed<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.329> used

then like 20 minutes has passed I used

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.300 
then like 20 minutes has passed I used
to<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> same<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to do the same thing but if and this is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
to do the same thing but if and this is
true<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.640> any<00:01:09.000> chords<00:01:09.510> any<00:01:09.810> chords<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
true with any chords any chords that we

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630 
true with any chords any chords that we
try<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.390> movement<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.860> possible

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
try to do as little movement as possible

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
try to do as little movement as possible
so<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.750> instance<00:01:16.080> keeping<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> third

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so for instance keeping that third

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
so for instance keeping that third
finger<00:01:17.189> where<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> same<00:01:18.990> note

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
finger where it is it's the same note

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
finger where it is it's the same note
we're<00:01:19.380> playing<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> exact<00:01:19.950> same<00:01:20.189> note<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> C

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
we're playing the exact same note as a C

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
we're playing the exact same note as a C
note<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> doesn't<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> come<00:01:22.890> off<00:01:23.159> at

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
note so it doesn't have to come off at

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.080 
note so it doesn't have to come off at
all

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
