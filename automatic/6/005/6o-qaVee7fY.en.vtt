highest honors to would probably be
plenty<00:01:09.179> without<00:01:09.719> a<00:01:09.899> question<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:11.039> were<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
plenty without a question there were the

plenty without a question there were the
doubters<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.789> moments<00:01:12.749> I<00:01:12.840> even<00:01:13.079> wondered

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
doubters and moments I even wondered

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.779 
doubters and moments I even wondered
well<00:01:13.649> are<00:01:13.859> we<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.219> going<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
happen but we stuck to it and we

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.459 
happen but we stuck to it and we
completed<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.149> planning<00:01:18.569> process<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.140> then

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
completed the planning process and then

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.039 
completed the planning process and then
one<00:01:19.710> day<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.549> shovels<00:01:20.969> hit<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.270> dirt<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
one day the shovels hit the dirt and we
