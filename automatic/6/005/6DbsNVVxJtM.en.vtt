because<00:00:43.010> you've<00:00:43.219> seen<00:00:43.489> start<00:00:44.480> with<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
because you've seen start with the

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.979 
because you've seen start with the
molecule<00:00:45.410> grip<00:00:45.699> where<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.940> packets<00:00:47.839> are

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
molecule grip where the packets are

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.529 
molecule grip where the packets are
supported<00:00:48.710> by<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.430> second<00:00:50.030> finger<00:00:50.360> at<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
supported by the second finger at the

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.680 
supported by the second finger at the
left<00:00:50.719> hand<00:00:50.989> as<00:00:51.620> opposed<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.760> civil<00:00:53.329> which

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
left hand as opposed to the civil which

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.160 
left hand as opposed to the civil which
is<00:00:53.839> supported<00:00:54.260> by<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.440> first<00:00:54.769> at<00:00:55.519> that<00:00:56.049> so<00:00:57.049> we

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
is supported by the first at that so we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.130 
is supported by the first at that so we
start<00:00:57.500> off<00:00:57.710> with<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:59.180> second<00:00:59.719> finger<00:00:59.809> ready

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
start off with the second finger ready

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.310 
start off with the second finger ready
at<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:00.379> top<00:01:00.589> right<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:02.210> cut<00:01:02.479> off<00:01:02.629> about<00:01:02.899> third

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
at the top right you cut off about third

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.830 
at the top right you cut off about third
off<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.220> bomb<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.699> it's<00:01:05.239> supported<00:01:05.750> between

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
off the bomb and it's supported between

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.480 
off the bomb and it's supported between
little<00:01:06.200> finger<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.799> base<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.009> the<00:01:07.280> thumb

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
little finger and the base of the thumb

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.740 
little finger and the base of the thumb
like<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:10.100> second<00:01:10.549> packet<00:01:10.880> comes<00:01:11.539> off

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
like that the second packet comes off

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.240 
like that the second packet comes off
the<00:01:11.990> second<00:01:12.950> finger<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.399> left<00:01:13.429> hand<00:01:13.670> and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
the second finger of the left hand and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.450 
the second finger of the left hand and
goes<00:01:16.250> into<00:01:16.490> Z<00:01:17.390> grip<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.890> top<00:01:19.100> packet

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
goes into Z grip and the top packet

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.980 
goes into Z grip and the top packet
supported<00:01:19.970> between<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.330> thumb<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.929> the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
supported between the thumb and the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.660 
supported between the thumb and the
second<00:01:21.770> finger<00:01:21.800> of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.369> right<00:01:22.399> hand<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:25.520> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
second finger of the right hand this is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.040 
second finger of the right hand this is
how<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.909> starts<00:01:26.800> so<00:01:27.800> you<00:01:27.890> come<00:01:28.130> up<00:01:28.159> like<00:01:28.520> this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.950 

what<00:01:33.050> happens<00:01:33.350> next<00:01:33.620> is<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.600> awesome<00:01:35.600> packet

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
what happens next is the awesome packet

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.190 
what happens next is the awesome packet
is<00:01:36.440> pushed<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.220> first<00:01:37.460> finger<00:01:37.700> up<00:01:38.660> to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
is pushed with the first finger up to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.930 
is pushed with the first finger up to
the<00:01:39.320> top<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:40.970> not<00:01:41.590> doesn't<00:01:42.590> come<00:01:42.770> flush<00:01:43.160> but

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
the top it is not doesn't come flush but

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.750 
the top it is not doesn't come flush but
it<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.240> gets<00:01:44.510> brought<00:01:45.020> together<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:46.460> need

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
it just gets brought together you need

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.400 
it just gets brought together you need
to<00:01:46.940> separate<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> packet<00:01:47.810> ever<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.170> slightly

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
to separate the packet ever so slightly

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.620 
to separate the packet ever so slightly
I<00:01:48.800> think<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> molecule<00:01:50.090> one

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
I think it's the molecule one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.200 
I think it's the molecule one
this<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.990> starts<00:01:51.410> off<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.250> come

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
this is starts off like this so you come

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.000 
this is starts off like this so you come
to<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.480> top<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:55.730> is<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.200> kept<00:01:57.200> separate

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
to the top and it is then kept separate

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.620 
to the top and it is then kept separate
so<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.520> comes<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.120> top

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
so it comes to the top

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.940 
so it comes to the top
let's<00:02:00.110> kept<00:02:00.320> separate<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.200> see<00:02:03.440> two

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
let's kept separate so you can see two

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.500 
let's kept separate so you can see two
packets<00:02:04.250> clearly<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.000> have<00:02:05.150> control<00:02:05.330> of

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
packets clearly and you have control of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.160 
packets clearly and you have control of
both<00:02:05.810> markets<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:07.370> top<00:02:07.670> packet<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.780> then

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
both markets the top packet is then

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.690 
both markets the top packet is then
swivel<00:02:09.619> cut<00:02:10.120> into<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.210> left<00:02:11.420> hand<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:12.020> top<00:02:12.830> of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
swivel cut into the left hand on top of

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.920 
swivel cut into the left hand on top of
now<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.600> bottom<00:02:15.020> packet<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.450> comes<00:02:17.690> off

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
now the bottom packet and that comes off

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.580 
now the bottom packet and that comes off
like<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.240> keep<00:02:20.510> hold<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.050> with

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
like that but you keep hold of it with

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.270 
like that but you keep hold of it with
your<00:02:21.710> thumb<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.640> Sharlee<00:02:23.390> opposition<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:25.070> then

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
your thumb in Sharlee opposition so then

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.670 
your thumb in Sharlee opposition so then
the<00:02:25.400> packet<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.790> Charlet<00:02:26.090> cut<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> bottom

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the packet is Charlet cut to the bottom

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the packet is Charlet cut to the bottom
bringing<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:27.980> packets<00:02:28.340> back<00:02:28.490> together

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
bringing the two packets back together

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.680 
bringing the two packets back together
and<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.120> how<00:02:29.300> they<00:02:29.450> start<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.450> last

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
and this is how they start the last

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.410 
and this is how they start the last
packet<00:02:33.110> now<00:02:33.350> needs<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> go<00:02:33.830> back<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.220> top<00:02:34.459> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
packet now needs to go back on top to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
packet now needs to go back on top to
completely<00:02:36.020> cut<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.620> also<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.250> make<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.670> false

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
completely cut and also to make it false

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.820 
completely cut and also to make it false
so<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.739> start<00:02:40.100> off<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.580> molecule<00:02:41.330> grip

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so we start off in molecule grip

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.000 
so we start off in molecule grip
molecule<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> bottom<00:02:43.220> packet<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.850> top

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
molecule the bottom packet to the top

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.250 
molecule the bottom packet to the top
this<00:02:46.010> then<00:02:46.400> gets<00:02:46.700> willed<00:02:47.120> into<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.750> left<00:02:47.959> hand

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
this then gets willed into the left hand

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.160 
this then gets willed into the left hand
Charlet<00:02:49.130> cut<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> bottom<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.209> then<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
Charlet cut to the bottom and then the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.320 
Charlet cut to the bottom and then the
last<00:02:51.320> packet<00:02:51.800> goes<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.130> top<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:53.209> is

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
last packet goes on top and this is

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.429 
last packet goes on top and this is
where<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.690> variations<00:02:54.200> start

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.140 

this<00:03:01.439> is<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.769> first<00:03:02.040> variation<00:03:02.939> to<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
this is the first variation to the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210 
this is the first variation to the
ending<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.689> cut<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.409> start<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
ending of this cut so you start with the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.679 
ending of this cut so you start with the
molecule<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.930> bottom<00:03:07.230> packet<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.709> top

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
molecule the bottom packet to the top

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.030 
molecule the bottom packet to the top
swivel<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.780> off<00:03:09.930> into<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.470> left<00:03:10.650> hand

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
swivel it off into the left hand

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
swivel it off into the left hand
Sharlee<00:03:11.489> 8th<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.790> bottom<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
Sharlee 8th to the bottom and then you

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
Sharlee 8th to the bottom and then you
do<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> sort<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.819> some<00:03:15.239> swivel<00:03:16.040> into<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.989> left

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
do a sort of some swivel into the left

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.479 
do a sort of some swivel into the left
hand<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.530> top<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.799> other<00:03:19.920> two<00:03:20.099> packets

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
hand on top of the other two packets

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.119 
hand on top of the other two packets
like<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.840> gets<00:03:22.019> twisted<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.709> half<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
like that so it gets twisted it's half a

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.369 
like that so it gets twisted it's half a
turn<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.360> that's<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.959> bit<00:03:25.109> you've<00:03:25.230> got<00:03:25.349> a

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
turn so that's the bit you've got a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.339 
turn so that's the bit you've got a
practice<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.480> more<00:03:27.659> accurate<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.230> can

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
practice and the more accurate you can

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.699 
practice and the more accurate you can
get<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:29.519> better<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.909> looks<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.659> that<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:34.230> we

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
get the better it looks like that so we

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.309 
get the better it looks like that so we
start<00:03:35.129> with<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> molecule<00:03:35.870> civil<00:03:36.870> cut

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
start with a molecule civil cut

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.410 
start with a molecule civil cut
Sharlee<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.069> bottom<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.639> then<00:03:39.000> thumbs

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
Sharlee to the bottom and then thumbs

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:50.800 
Sharlee to the bottom and then thumbs
will<00:03:39.780> go<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.349> top

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.600 

the<00:03:51.810> secondary<00:03:52.319> ation<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.830> called<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.190> swipe

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
the secondary ation is called the swipe

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.870 
the secondary ation is called the swipe
close<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.160> molecule<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.430> bottom<00:03:56.700> pocket

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
close so you molecule the bottom pocket

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.380 
close so you molecule the bottom pocket
to<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.390> top<00:03:58.280> this<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.550> gets<00:03:59.790> swivel<00:04:00.180> cut

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
to the top this then gets swivel cut

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.930 
to the top this then gets swivel cut
into<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.470> middle<00:04:01.739> charlie<00:04:02.550> account<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
into the middle charlie account to the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.850 
into the middle charlie account to the
bottom<00:04:03.270> when<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> last<00:04:04.170> packet<00:04:04.620> gets

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
bottom when you the last packet gets

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.490 
bottom when you the last packet gets
swiped<00:04:05.580> face<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:06.120> with<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.390> thumb<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.959> then

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
swiped face up with the thumb and then

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.000 
swiped face up with the thumb and then
close<00:04:07.890> like<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> book<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:10.380> actually<00:04:10.739> happens

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
close like a book this actually happens

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.850 
close like a book this actually happens
at<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> same<00:04:11.459> time<00:04:11.760> as<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.630> Shirley<00:04:13.349> out<00:04:13.590> cut

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
at the same time as the Shirley out cut

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.979 
at the same time as the Shirley out cut
just<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.780> packet<00:04:16.410> gets<00:04:16.820> swiped<00:04:17.820> open<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
just now the packet gets swiped open and

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.879 
just now the packet gets swiped open and
then<00:04:19.139> closed<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.440> gives<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.860> a

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
then closed like that so this gives it a

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.150 
then closed like that so this gives it a
bit<00:04:22.979> more<00:04:23.160> flow<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> there's<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.889> little<00:04:29.040> bit

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
bit more flow so there's a little bit

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.180 
bit more flow so there's a little bit
sketchy<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.840> idea<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.950> last

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
sketchy but you get the idea so the last

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.330 
sketchy but you get the idea so the last
packet<00:04:38.669> gets<00:04:38.790> swiped<00:04:39.240> up<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:40.860> flows

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
packet gets swiped up and then flows

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.600 
packet gets swiped up and then flows
like<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.580> book

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.430 

the<00:04:46.610> last<00:04:46.849> variation<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.629> called<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.870> flip<00:04:48.139> and

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
the last variation is called a flip and

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.020 
the last variation is called a flip and
looks<00:04:48.650> like<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.860> take<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.460> packet

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
looks like that so you take the packet

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.770 
looks like that so you take the packet
between<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.930> thumb<00:04:54.409> and<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:55.750> second<00:04:56.750> finger

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
between the thumb and the second finger

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.320 
between the thumb and the second finger
slightly<00:04:57.770> towards<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.580> right<00:04:58.759> of<00:04:58.909> a<00:04:58.970> packet

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
slightly towards the right of a packet

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.540 
slightly towards the right of a packet
and<00:04:59.569> then<00:04:59.690> flip<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.169> with<00:05:00.650> your<00:05:00.889> first<00:05:01.280> finger

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
and then flip it with your first finger

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.570 
and then flip it with your first finger
from<00:05:01.970> underneath<00:05:02.270> they<00:05:03.169> gets<00:05:03.379> flipped<00:05:03.620> 360

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
from underneath they gets flipped 360

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.869 
from underneath they gets flipped 360
degrees<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:06.590> start<00:05:06.889> with<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.069> molecule<00:05:07.280> the

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
degrees so you start with a molecule the

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.499 
degrees so you start with a molecule the
bottom<00:05:08.150> packet<00:05:08.539> goes<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> top<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:11.150> swivel

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
bottom packet goes to the top you swivel

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.779 
bottom packet goes to the top you swivel
it<00:05:11.720> into<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.139> middle<00:05:12.440> Sharlee<00:05:13.400> eight<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.699> the

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
it into the middle Sharlee eight to the

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.330 
it into the middle Sharlee eight to the
bottom<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.360> then<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.139> last<00:05:15.800> pack<00:05:16.069> gets

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
bottom and then the last pack gets

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.959 
bottom and then the last pack gets
flipped<00:05:16.639> on<00:05:16.909> top<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:20.740> molecule<00:05:21.740> bomb<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.909> the

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
flipped on top so molecule bomb to the

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.020 
flipped on top so molecule bomb to the
top<00:05:24.460> swivel<00:05:25.460> cut

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
top swivel cut

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.190 
top swivel cut
Sharlee<00:05:26.509> eight<00:05:26.629> and<00:05:26.960> then<00:05:27.080> get<00:05:27.500> back<00:05:27.830> on<00:05:27.979> top
