so<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.350> show<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.949> best<00:00:02.159> way<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.520> pin<00:00:03.179> your

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
so to show you the best way to pin your

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.170 
so to show you the best way to pin your
pattern<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.170> your<00:00:04.380> fabric<00:00:04.950> rather<00:00:05.819> than

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
pattern to your fabric rather than

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.870 
pattern to your fabric rather than
actually<00:00:06.990> borrowing<00:00:07.589> underneath<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.610> order

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
actually borrowing underneath in order

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.940 
actually borrowing underneath in order
to<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> pin<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.780> there's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.410> way<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.740> doing

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to get the pin in there's a way of doing

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.350 
to get the pin in there's a way of doing
it<00:00:11.160> where<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.730> keep<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.120> pattern

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
it where you can just keep the pattern

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.749 
it where you can just keep the pattern
and<00:00:12.809> fabric<00:00:13.170> completely<00:00:13.620> flat<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> table

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and fabric completely flat on the table

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.140 
and fabric completely flat on the table
and<00:00:14.910> therefore<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:15.990> dislodging<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.760> layout

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and therefore not dislodging the layout

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.010 
and therefore not dislodging the layout
that<00:00:18.330> you've<00:00:18.510> already<00:00:18.750> done<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.789> put<00:00:21.240> one

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that you've already done so you put one

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.189 
that you've already done so you put one
finger<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.070> hold<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.939> pin<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:24.930> use

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
finger down and hold the pin you can use

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.009 
finger down and hold the pin you can use
long<00:00:25.529> pins<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.420> quilting

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
long pins if you can get the quilting

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.370 
long pins if you can get the quilting
pins<00:00:28.490> or<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:30.000> slightly<00:00:30.449> longer<00:00:30.689> pins<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.230> got

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
pins or these slightly longer pins I got

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
pins or these slightly longer pins I got
from<00:00:31.560> eBay<00:00:31.769> they're<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> good<00:00:33.120> few<00:00:33.360> millimeters

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
from eBay they're a good few millimeters

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.630 
from eBay they're a good few millimeters
longer<00:00:34.290> than<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> ones<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> normal

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
longer than the ones you can the normal

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
longer than the ones you can the normal
dressmaking<00:00:36.120> pin<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> lot

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dressmaking pin so they make this a lot

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
dressmaking pin so they make this a lot
easier<00:00:38.010> than<00:00:38.460> pinning<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.149> general<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
easier than pinning in general it's a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920 
easier than pinning in general it's a
lot<00:00:39.809> easier<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> push<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> pin

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
lot easier with these so push the pin

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.560 
lot easier with these so push the pin
into<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> fabric<00:00:43.850> holding<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.210> thumb

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
into the fabric holding with your thumb

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
into the fabric holding with your thumb
and<00:00:45.719> middle<00:00:45.780> finger<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:46.890> second

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and middle finger but use your second

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.450 
and middle finger but use your second
finger<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> slightly<00:00:48.390> pivot<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.860> pattern<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
finger to slightly pivot the pattern and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
finger to slightly pivot the pattern and
fabric<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.469> holding<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
fabric up and then with this holding the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.900 
fabric up and then with this holding the
pattern<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> place<00:00:54.050> push<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.699> move

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
pattern in place push and then just move

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.670 
pattern in place push and then just move
your<00:00:57.090> finger<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> last<00:00:58.050> minute<00:00:58.469> so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.850 

finger<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:08.780> pin<00:01:09.780> between<00:01:09.960> thumb<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.560> middle

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
finger down pin between thumb and middle

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
finger down pin between thumb and middle
finger<00:01:12.470> push<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> pin<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.850> pivot<00:01:15.270> up

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
finger push the pin in and just pivot up

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.120 
finger push the pin in and just pivot up
a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> sometimes<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a little bit you have sometimes have to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
a little bit you have sometimes have to
roll<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.610> hand<00:01:17.880> over<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
roll your hand over to actually get the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.940 
roll your hand over to actually get the
angle<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> pivot<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> finger<00:01:21.950> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
angle to pivot up with that finger and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
angle to pivot up with that finger and
push<00:01:23.189> through<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.939> move<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.299> finger<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
push through and move your finger at the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
push through and move your finger at the
last<00:01:24.990> minute<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.100> carry<00:01:26.369> on

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
last minute so you can just carry on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
last minute so you can just carry on
doing<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> way<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:28.619> we'll

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
doing that all the way around what we'll

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.830 
doing that all the way around what we'll
do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.979> probably<00:01:29.159> pin<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:30.030> first<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
do is probably pin this side first and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.429 
do is probably pin this side first and
then<00:01:30.930> slowly<00:01:31.500> pin<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> other<00:01:33.210> side

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
then slowly pin down the other side

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
then slowly pin down the other side
smoothing<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> make<00:01:35.430> sure<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
smoothing as you go to make sure you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230 
smoothing as you go to make sure you
haven't<00:01:36.750> added<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.229> any<00:01:37.590> creases<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.610> lumps

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
haven't added in any creases or lumps

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.410 
haven't added in any creases or lumps
and<00:01:39.650> that's<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> best<00:01:41.040> way<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> pin<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and that's the best way to pin if you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
and that's the best way to pin if you
pin<00:01:42.720> along<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.070> edge<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> pattern<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
pin along the edge of the pattern and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.109 
pin along the edge of the pattern and
about<00:01:45.920> 3/4<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> centimeter<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> half<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
about 3/4 of a centimeter to half a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
about 3/4 of a centimeter to half a
centimeter<00:01:48.659> away<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> edge<00:01:49.560> you'll

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
centimeter away from the edge you'll

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.960 
centimeter away from the edge you'll
find<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.149> easier<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.049> cut<00:01:52.759> because<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
find it a lot easier to cut because the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.399 
find it a lot easier to cut because the
further<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.450> away<00:01:54.750> from<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> edge<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
further it is away from the edge the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
further it is away from the edge the
more<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.799> paper<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.250> flap<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.600> terms

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
more the paper can flap up and in terms

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
more the paper can flap up and in terms
of<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:58.229> far<00:01:58.590> part<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> want<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> space<00:01:59.670> them

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of how far part you want to space them

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.340 
of how far part you want to space them
well<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> definitely<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> pin<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> your

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
well you definitely want to pin to your

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.510 
well you definitely want to pin to your
corners<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.610> spacing<00:02:03.270> probably<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.619> would<00:02:05.490> say

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.710 
corners but spacing probably I would say
about<00:02:06.000> an<00:02:06.240> inch<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.719> between<00:02:07.320> pins<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
about an inch or so between pins and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.849 
about an inch or so between pins and
that<00:02:09.720> should<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.200> much<00:02:11.129> easier<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.670> cut
