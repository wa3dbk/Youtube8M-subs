00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.009
 hello everyone then this is 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.509
 the highly anticipated video of the giveaway ho 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.180
 had to wait because I wanted anyway 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.980
 wait a minute to fix things i 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.619
 videos do a lot of tutorials first 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 then start doing it then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 we start immediately with the prizes and after 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.589
 quickly I tell you two or three rules 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.030
 the rest you can find everything here 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.309
 then in the written info box 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
 read it because very important then 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.089
 we start immediately with others but before the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 first time a first prize just the 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.860
 the first thing of the award because for one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.909
 this only clutch is this winner 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.339
 Fuchsia water with blacks men with 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.640
 zip everything this thing 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.659
 where I finally connect all the Turks who 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 will then we start from this that is 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.930
 a little lower colors tic I have it too 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.689
 it's pretty much a blush bar 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.640
 illuminating stick that is fantastic 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 because I 'm continuing to use it a little 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.210
 I use that other big one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.460
 if you saw my videos anyway a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.760
 however, when I have to hurry 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 I always use this here for the face 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.000
 I'm also using this here which is the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 corrector always with the line anyway 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.970
 cover sticks are very comfortable because they are 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 in stick and then there's a lot of it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 product inside is this here 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.560
 applied color beige should be 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.790
 the clearer if I'm not mistaken because from 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.990
 the one taken is also using it too 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.030
 I, however, if I am not more clear 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 this here then always for the face this 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.190
 file the retort this foundation that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.100
 with spf 15 then sun protection 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.259
 even if lately the sun disappeared 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.119
 15 sun protection and this is it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.220
 color that looks very dark instead me 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.990
 that very clear complexion 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.299
 it's great because it gives me that effect 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.489
 slightly tanned so it matches 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.039
 well with even lighter color is if 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.480
 you are this darker than me with genoa 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.690
 all however the whole face all over 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.420
 how perfect this one is then then 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 let 's take the illuminating illuminant 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.880
 this pavel I had shown in 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 in the swatch I did this does 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.700
 very liquid 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.530
 so be careful when using it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 what a lot of product comes out of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 being just a lot of liquid it comes out 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.760
 too much then press a little less though 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.380
 it is perfect because this is very bright 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.340
 a bit for choices or rosÃ© for le 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.730
 sciences and it's amazing how limiting for 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.200
 my eyes instead I thought of these two 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.660
 I thought of two colors anyway 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.360
 you could use for the evening and for the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.040
 day for the evening this here you can 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.500
 make a smokey eyes are both 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.940
 creamy cats always from yesterday among 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.780
 all of the aiff and is gray and black and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.019
 then instead a coffee and chocolate color is 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.400
 these creamy ones here and I 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.049
 I have it too, I took the same ones 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.060
 products that I wanted to take him for 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.859
 try them first and found myself by god 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.290
 with everyone of course before 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.609
 then spread these over a base if 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.530
 you don't want to do the classic line 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.109
 of the eyelid a base however that is 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.019
 one excuses an opacity above of 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.620
 powder eye shadow to hold back 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.579
 plus the cream color passing instead 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.920
 to the lips 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.340
 I thought these two is the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.650
 nostalgic that the nude color lipstick 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 color news which is fantastic among all 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 nude you experience this quality that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.019
 I was looking for the tone of news that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.540
 I wanted it not even so beautiful but 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.530
 he is also a brownish so I saw e 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.440

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.330

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.070
 plumping effect organize 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.900
 volumizing on this side there is the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.300
