00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:07.507
 - How Skyrim was supposed to end - 

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:11.141
 We taught you as much as we can, native to the dragon. 

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:15.652
 Only through the power of the voice of the dragon can you defeat Aldoin. 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.191
 Come on, show us what you learned. 

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:20.804
 Fos-ro-de! 

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:24.432
 Well, your scream is strong. 

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.577
 But be careful that you control your voice and not control you. 

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:30.817
 Okay, I'll take care! 

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:34.344
 -I love Gandalf- 

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:34.992
 Wow. 

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:35.874
 Sorry! 

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.111
 Want the stick? Go get it! 

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.377
 What is it, what happened, my brother to the shield? 

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:02.368
 I think he's trying to tell us something. 

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.595
 Oh no, little Timmy fell into the well! 

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:06.106
 M...? 

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.314
 Come on, friends, we have a journey. 

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:13.930
 No journey ... 

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:20.493
 Aldoin attacks Dragonerschich. 

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:25.746
 He went inside! 

00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:27.723
 Who will defend Harel? 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.663
 No one strong enough to fight Aldoain. 

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:36.244
 Fos-ro-de! 

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:40.766
 Here, Sero! 

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:42.244
 or... 

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.572
 Lor-Torjou! 

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:46.463
 Wow! 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.810
 Ah-Sloss! 

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:52.571
 Character-Train! 

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:57.030
 Laughing! 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.130
 Oh, the dragon-born, 

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:00.652
 You amuse me. 

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.920
 I'm just glad I have someone to talk to! 

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:08.717
 Another Nordic? 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.641
 Why not?! 

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:15.666
 for life. 

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.890
 -The end- 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.023
 Fos-ro-de! 

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.688
 Wow. - He's so brave. 

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:32.151
 I used to be like him. 

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:34.749
 And then I got an arrow in ... - Shut up! 

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:37.737
 Honestly ...
