that's that is all of space mountain
everybody<00:03:58.060> fine<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.990> is<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.820> think<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.880> AC

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
everybody fine and it is I think the AC

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.060 
everybody fine and it is I think the AC
went<00:04:02.420> off<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.810> think<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:03.710> time<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.890> get<00:04:04.010> a

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
went off I think it's time to get a

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.710 
went off I think it's time to get a
little<00:04:04.310> warmer<00:04:04.460> but<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.000> kick<00:04:05.360> off<00:04:05.480> cuz<00:04:05.690> I

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
little warmer but it's kick off cuz I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.480 
little warmer but it's kick off cuz I
