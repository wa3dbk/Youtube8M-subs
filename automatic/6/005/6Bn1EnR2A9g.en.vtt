of<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.880> bigger<00:01:47.060> machine<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:47.600> got<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> more

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
of it's a bigger machine it's got a more

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.660 
of it's a bigger machine it's got a more
powerful<00:01:48.110> motor<00:01:48.470> it's<00:01:49.130> got<00:01:49.250> bigger<00:01:49.430> auger

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
powerful motor it's got bigger auger

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.940 
powerful motor it's got bigger auger
system<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.930> we<00:01:50.990> need<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> more<00:01:51.439> powerful<00:01:51.590> motor

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
system and we need a more powerful motor

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.380 
system and we need a more powerful motor
and<00:01:52.189> bigger<00:01:52.369> auger<00:01:52.610> system<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.939> deal<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and bigger auger system to deal with the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.120 
and bigger auger system to deal with the
outdoor<00:01:53.750> ice<00:01:53.930> arena<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.409> snow<00:01:54.590> off<00:01:54.770> there<00:01:55.009> I

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
outdoor ice arena get snow off there I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.550 
outdoor ice arena get snow off there I
mean<00:01:55.479> actually<00:01:56.479> came<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.200> idea<00:01:57.500> of

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
mean actually came up with the idea of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.649 
mean actually came up with the idea of
scraping<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> snow<00:01:58.520> off<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.090> machine<00:01:59.210> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
scraping the snow off of the machine and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.450 
scraping the snow off of the machine and
putting<00:02:00.079> water<00:02:00.290> down<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:00.770> how<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.340> all

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
putting water down what how that all

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.780 
putting water down what how that all
come<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.759> be<00:02:01.880> in<00:02:02.810> 1949<00:02:03.470> Frank<00:02:03.950> Zamboni<00:02:04.369> decided

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
of quickly the mechanism how it actually

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.440 
of quickly the mechanism how it actually
all<00:02:22.010> works<00:02:22.220> yeah<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.180> called<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
all works yeah this is called the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.850 
all works yeah this is called the
conditioner<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.530> front<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.799> the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
conditioner in the front of the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.530 
conditioner in the front of the
conditioner<00:02:25.250> there's<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.519> is<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.820> blade<00:02:26.090> scrapes

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
conditioner there's a is a blade scrapes

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.680 
conditioner there's a is a blade scrapes
the<00:02:26.690> ice<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:28.310> snow<00:02:28.760> gets<00:02:29.180> gathered<00:02:29.570> up

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
the ice and the snow gets gathered up

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.090 
the ice and the snow gets gathered up
and<00:02:29.900> shot<00:02:30.079> into<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.290> bin<00:02:30.560> which<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:30.860> located

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
and shot into the bin which is located

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.650 
and shot into the bin which is located
right<00:02:31.310> here<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.269> back<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.600> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
right here in the back of the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.759 
right here in the back of the
conditioner<00:02:33.079> that<00:02:33.110> are<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> center<00:02:33.739> of

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
conditioner that are in the center of

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.920 
conditioner that are in the center of
the<00:02:33.890> conditioner<00:02:34.340> water<00:02:35.150> squirts<00:02:35.570> down<00:02:35.720> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the conditioner water squirts down and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.069 
the conditioner water squirts down and
misses<00:02:36.400> mixes<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.579> snow<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.630> fills<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:38.989> any

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
misses mixes with snow and fills in any

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.020 
misses mixes with snow and fills in any
cracks<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> ice<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.489> back<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:40.910> we

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
cracks in the ice in the back here we

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.789 
cracks in the ice in the back here we
have<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.329> hot<00:02:41.600> hot<00:02:42.019> water<00:02:42.200> comes<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.680> this

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
have a hot hot water comes out of this

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.099 
have a hot hot water comes out of this
pipe<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.299> towel<00:02:44.510> smoothes<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:44.989> out

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
pipe here and the towel smoothes it out

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.830 
pipe here and the towel smoothes it out
makes<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.470> look<00:02:45.590> pretty<00:02:45.620> very<00:02:46.340> nice<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.880> now

with this class people can sign up and
how<00:02:50.780> long<00:02:51.200> does<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.349> take<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.650> figure<00:02:51.890> out<00:02:52.010> how

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
how long does it take to figure out how

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.500 
how long does it take to figure out how
to<00:02:52.190> drive<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.550> thing<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:53.330> about<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
to drive this thing it's about a
