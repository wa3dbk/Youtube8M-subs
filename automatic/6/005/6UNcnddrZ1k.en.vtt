you get it for free I use a 2 by 10 on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500 
you get it for free I use a 2 by 10 on
top<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.320> trained<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> 2<00:00:20.189> by<00:00:20.340> 10<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:21.240> top

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
top not trained it's the 2 by 10 on top

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.880 
top not trained it's the 2 by 10 on top
so<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> between<00:00:22.050> nine<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> half<00:00:22.560> inch

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so that between nine and a half inch

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.500 
so that between nine and a half inch
dimension<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:24.539> cut<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.869> four<00:00:25.260> feet<00:00:25.590> long

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
dimension and I cut it four feet long

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.970 
dimension and I cut it four feet long
right<00:00:27.510> making<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> any<00:00:28.170> length<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> need<00:00:28.740> but

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
right making it any length you need but
it's<00:00:29.099> 4<00:00:29.250> feet<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.789> us<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> then<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.660> 45

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it's 4 feet for us and then I just 45

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.049 
it's 4 feet for us and then I just 45
the<00:00:31.590> corners<00:00:31.980> off<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> regular<00:00:32.910> little

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the corners off just a regular little

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.459 
the corners off just a regular little
round<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:34.110> right

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.300 

I<00:02:48.019> always<00:02:49.019> double-check<00:02:49.469> after<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> first

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
and just to make those cuts you just

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.880 
and just to make those cuts you just
turn<00:03:12.580> your<00:03:12.760> compound<00:03:13.420> miter<00:03:13.600> saw<00:03:13.690> at<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> 45

degree<00:03:15.010> angle<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.550> just<00:03:15.670> chop<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.120> corner

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
degree angle and just chop that corner

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.100 
degree angle and just chop that corner
off<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.790> other<00:03:18.940> thing<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.210> I<00:03:19.360> did<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.750> I<00:03:19.840> cut
