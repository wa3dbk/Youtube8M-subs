it's<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.170> beautiful<00:00:10.679> shade<00:00:10.980> plant<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.550> does

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
it's a beautiful shade plant that does

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.730 
it's a beautiful shade plant that does
really<00:00:12.120> well<00:00:12.450> almost<00:00:12.809> anywhere<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> world

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
really well almost anywhere in the world

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.210 
really well almost anywhere in the world
so<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.730> bed<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.450> full<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.100> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
so this bed is full of for now it's a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.810 
so this bed is full of for now it's a
beautiful<00:00:17.460> dark<00:00:18.180> reddish<00:00:18.869> pink<00:00:19.560> flower<00:00:20.010> they

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
beautiful dark reddish pink flower they

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.910 
beautiful dark reddish pink flower they
fade<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.480> now<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.289> can't<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.800> how

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
fade it out now so you can't see how

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
fade it out now so you can't see how
beautiful<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.519> were<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.660> they<00:00:24.750> were

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
beautiful they really were but they were

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.170 
beautiful they really were but they were
just<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.199> beautiful<00:00:25.439> magenta<00:00:26.160> color<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
just this beautiful magenta color and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
just this beautiful magenta color and
really<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:28.140> foliage<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
really pretty foliage they like the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
really pretty foliage they like the
shade<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:29.939> planting<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
shade so I'm just planting them here so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.020 
shade so I'm just planting them here so
that<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.500> divide<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.730> dig<00:00:32.910> them

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that they can divide and I can dig them

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
that they can divide and I can dig them
up<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.270> separate<00:00:33.719> them<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.020> sell<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> plant

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
up and separate them and sell the plant

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
up and separate them and sell the plant
and<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:36.000> grow<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.910> multiply

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and they really grow so as they multiply

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.900 
and they really grow so as they multiply
it's<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.079> massive<00:00:40.980> set<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.370> roots<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it's just a massive set of roots and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
it's just a massive set of roots and
they're<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.840> easy<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> grow<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
they're so easy to grow because all you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
they're so easy to grow because all you
need<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.700> basically<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.480> root<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
need is basically a root to get them to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
need is basically a root to get them to
grow<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.879> big<00:00:48.239> clump<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.930> separate

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
grow so this big clump I can separate

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
grow so this big clump I can separate
probably<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.070> ten<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.579> clumps<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
probably into ten little clumps and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
probably into ten little clumps and
they'll<00:00:51.750> multiply<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.440> quickly<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
they'll multiply very quickly and then I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.549 
they'll multiply very quickly and then I
just<00:00:54.270> saw<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> clumps<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> people<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.469> them

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
just saw the clumps and people put them

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709 
just saw the clumps and people put them
in<00:00:55.680> their<00:00:55.800> yard<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
in their yard and they do really well so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.939 
in their yard and they do really well so
a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> times<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.379> separate<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.859> out

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
a lot of times when I separate them out

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
a lot of times when I separate them out
too<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.340> cut<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> green<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
too I'll cut down the green so I have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
too I'll cut down the green so I have
the<00:01:00.870> plant<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> roots<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.730> sell<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the plant or just the roots to sell and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
the plant or just the roots to sell and
then<00:01:03.270> they'll<00:01:03.390> grow<00:01:03.570> new<00:01:03.809> roots<00:01:03.840> too<00:01:04.409> almost

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
then they'll grow new roots too almost

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.920 
then they'll grow new roots too almost
year-round<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.360> divide<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.810> out

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
year-round so you can divide them out

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.359 
year-round so you can divide them out
and<00:01:07.110> divide<00:01:07.380> them<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.100> pieces

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and divide them out into little pieces

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.039 
and divide them out into little pieces
and<00:01:08.610> they'll<00:01:08.909> grow<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.420> wonderful<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and they'll grow it's wonderful it's a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.300 
and they'll grow it's wonderful it's a
wonderful<00:01:10.409> plant<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.830> share<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.159> your

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
wonderful plant to share with your

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
wonderful plant to share with your
friends<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.170> shade<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.040> don't

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> moisture<00:01:33.000> cuz<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.930> too

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
a lot of moisture cuz if they get too

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
a lot of moisture cuz if they get too
dry<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.710> roots<00:01:34.979> dry<00:01:35.220> out<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.700> nothing

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
dry and these roots dry out to nothing

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.240 
dry and these roots dry out to nothing
you<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.810> lose<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.200> they've<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.920> stay

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you will lose them they've got to stay

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.069 
you will lose them they've got to stay
moist<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.850> roots<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.900> if

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
moist these roots will not do well if

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.800 
moist these roots will not do well if
