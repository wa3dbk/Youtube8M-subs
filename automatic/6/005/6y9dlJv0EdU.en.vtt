00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
rent 80 which is chicka Martin is

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.150 
rent 80 which is chicka Martin is
building<00:02:39.459> isn't<00:02:40.209> actually<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.590> south<00:02:41.890> and

building isn't actually to the south and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.009 
building isn't actually to the south and
this<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.579> south<00:02:42.790> here<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.780> would<00:02:43.989> have

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
this is the south here so it would have

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.180 
this is the south here so it would have
been<00:02:44.320> somewhere<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.519> here<00:02:46.709> where<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:47.980> don't

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
been somewhere in here where we don't

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.400 
been somewhere in here where we don't
know<00:02:48.310> actually<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.450> egoic<00:02:52.870> older<00:02:53.230> guy

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
know actually so the egoic older guy

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.070 
know actually so the egoic older guy
would<00:02:53.739> have<00:02:53.769> been<00:02:53.920> around<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:54.900> they're<00:02:55.900> not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.240 

right<00:03:00.080> we've<00:03:00.260> just<00:03:00.440> been<00:03:00.560> having<00:03:00.770> them<00:03:00.920> for

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
right we've just been having them for

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
right we've just been having them for
look<00:03:01.490> at<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.700> guys<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.210> it<00:03:02.690> seems<00:03:02.960> that<00:03:03.020> this

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
look at it guys and it seems that this

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.720 
look at it guys and it seems that this
wall<00:03:03.530> here<00:03:04.090> maybe<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:07.010> actual<00:03:07.370> edge<00:03:07.520> of<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
wall here maybe the actual edge of the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
wall here maybe the actual edge of the
castle<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.390> we're<00:03:08.540> not<00:03:08.630> sure<00:03:08.810> what<00:03:09.050> rent<00:03:09.230> paid

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
castle and we're not sure what rent paid

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.620 
castle and we're not sure what rent paid
all<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.740> dojo<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> chick<00:03:10.670> amato<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.300> probably

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
all the dojo of chick amato is probably

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.690 
all the dojo of chick amato is probably
outside<00:03:11.840> we're<00:03:12.290> at<00:03:12.470> my<00:03:12.620> feet<00:03:12.860> are<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.460> it<00:03:13.550> might

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
outside we're at my feet are so it might

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.570 
outside we're at my feet are so it might
be<00:03:13.730> further<00:03:14.210> this<00:03:14.360> way<00:03:14.420> we<00:03:15.320> don't<00:03:15.350> know<00:03:15.680> so

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
be further this way we don't know so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.070 
be further this way we don't know so
obviously<00:03:16.970> we're<00:03:17.480> never<00:03:17.600> going<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.810> find<00:03:17.930> out

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
obviously we're never going to find out

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.540 
obviously we're never going to find out
where<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.380> less<00:03:18.620> we<00:03:18.740> find<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.980> detailed<00:03:19.130> map

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
where is less we find a detailed map

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.850 
where is less we find a detailed map
