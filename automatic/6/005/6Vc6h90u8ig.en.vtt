00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello buds that have nothing else 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.480
 what to do more than watch videos on youtube 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 I hope they are fine as they already were 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.010
 account I changed my voice from diego for that of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.590
 jorge since I've seen many videos in 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.900
 youtube that mostly better said in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
 they used Jorge's voice like that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189
 I wanted to change it to see if it goes up 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 the rating although that does not matter much to me 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.359
 the videos I only make them as a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 hobby and because I like to make them 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.890
 well I'm leaving the subject as 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.859
 they saw in the title today I will teach them to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.020
 how to merge pokémons this series is a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.880
 of my favorites and therefore I saw a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.219
 video on youtube about this but I do not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.860
 liked how they explained it so I wanted to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 do one like this before you start them 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 I want to introduce a friend of mine who 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.829

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.850
 and watch my videos so they have more 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.540
 views than those of num 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.150

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.240
 let me be in one of your videos and if 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.630
 you need me just call me so I 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.090
 goodbye goodbye curos even if you're 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.330
 good good friends without further delays 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 I will start the video well the first thing is to go 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.020
 to the page that I will leave in the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.020
 description of the video that by the way is 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.970
 www.pope2you.net is then open 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.000
 our computer in my case is the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.580
 Google Chrome 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 when the page appears we will have 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 all the spreads of the games I them 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.729
 I recommend the one that says black and white 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.430
 pokémons sprites because they are better than 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.900
 the others will then have the entire list of 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.940
 the 649 pokémons and choose whichever they want 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.670
 in my case download and update and here 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.709
 lava because they are my favorite xd for 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.020
 save them just right click on 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.640
 the drawing you are given to keep as and choose 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 how do they want to be called and where 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.280
 save it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.739
 fuck this if it takes x of good 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.900
 When the download is finished they go to 30 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.490
 that they have well now they look for the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.970
 spirits 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 in my case it's clipboard pasting paste 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 from and I choose the file when they have 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.440
 the sprites to merge them there's only 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.600
 to get parts to the pokemons this 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 it's very easy to just choose the part that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.490
 want in my case the key lava games 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.320
 and I will put them to charizar them 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.319
 I recommend using the magnifying glass and the rubber on 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.569
 minimum 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.340
 now they only erase their surroundings and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.730
 choose the option to select the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.730
 image 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.439
 oh by the way very important that they have 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.569
 indicated the selection option 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.130
 transparent because if you do not get the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.530
 white color background 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.050
 well now select the option of 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.050
 select live and choose the image 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.310
 now I will teach you a couple of tricks 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.290
 first if the rubber does not fit between 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.600
 the places use the white pencil and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.550
 paint what you do not want here are the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.550
 I'll show you just look how I do it 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.860
 the second is that if you want to put a 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.620
 detail that is between two 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.350
 things just select a part in 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.030
 my face case and copy it now 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.180
 paste on the part you wanted to put on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.370
 beginning of the desired place after 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.920
 that sticks in the copied part and put lan 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.410
 above the previous part think about 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.350
 the outline of the initial spirit I know that 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.920
 enough were lost with this xd if it's 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.850
 A) Yes 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.850
 look how I do it 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.810
 I forgot that if they want to turn the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.530
 picture click on rotate and choose 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.530
 how they want it 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.950
 now the last trick this is very 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.740
 known but if they do not know it they are 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.330
 I'll say if they want to erase some error just 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.510
 squeeze the zeta while they have 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.540
 tight control and well that's it 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.120
 one last recommendation this is more a 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.610
 help try to make the mergers 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.970
 of the same type that if they prefer that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.830
 it is my opinion my friends forgive that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.820
 the video is so long but it was worth the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.010
 pain 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.930
 this cost me a lot and it still hurts 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.500
 on the fingers xd so without more than 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.710
 say goodbye to your good friend in a box 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.390
 998 goodbye 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.420
 I must be the best, it's only better to win 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.420
 nothing else 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.420
 but 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.139
 and we 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.750
 why
