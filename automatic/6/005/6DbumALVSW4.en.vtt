00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.560 

so<00:01:23.590> what<00:01:23.740> we're<00:01:23.860> trying<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.220> do<00:01:24.550> at<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.790> VTL<00:01:25.180> is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
so what we're trying to do at the VTL is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.470 
so what we're trying to do at the VTL is
basically<00:01:26.170> offer<00:01:26.410> students<00:01:27.190> with<00:01:27.760> absolutely

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
basically offer students with absolutely

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.260 
basically offer students with absolutely
no<00:01:29.200> knowledge<00:01:29.440> of<00:01:29.800> this<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.220> way<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.180> achieve<00:01:31.570> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
no knowledge of this a way to achieve a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.620 
no knowledge of this a way to achieve a
proficiency<00:01:34.270> in<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.810> really<00:01:36.390> equates<00:01:37.390> or

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
proficiency in it that really equates or

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.630 
proficiency in it that really equates or
qualifies<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.560> industry<00:01:38.980> standard<00:01:39.520> of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
qualifies to the industry standard of

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.750 
qualifies to the industry standard of
motion<00:01:40.120> capture<00:01:40.630> systems<00:01:41.110> technician<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.250> so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
motion capture systems technician and so

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.450 
motion capture systems technician and so
there's<00:01:42.970> three<00:01:43.480> classes<00:01:44.080> that's<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.530> series<00:01:45.430> of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
there's three classes that's a series of

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.400 
there's three classes that's a series of
classes<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.120> take<00:01:46.630> us<00:01:46.840> from<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.230> very

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
classes that take us from the very

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.370 
classes that take us from the very
beginning<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.670> rather<00:01:48.880> complicated<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:50.020> I

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
beginning to rather complicated in I

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230 
beginning to rather complicated in I
guess<00:01:50.740> some<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.190> most<00:01:51.790> interesting

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
guess some of the most interesting

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.700 
guess some of the most interesting
things<00:01:52.420> I've<00:01:52.660> personally<00:01:53.170> learned<00:01:53.410> about

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
things I've personally learned about

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.430 
things I've personally learned about
motion<00:01:54.400> capture<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.790> animation<00:01:55.440> would

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
motion capture and animation would

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.640 
motion capture and animation would
probably<00:01:57.310> be<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.390> very<00:01:58.780> different<00:01:59.200> acting

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
probably be this very different acting

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.230 
probably be this very different acting
style<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.100> gonna<00:02:00.250> take<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.670> long<00:02:00.880> time<00:02:00.910> to

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
style it's gonna take a long time to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.380 
style it's gonna take a long time to
really<00:02:01.360> perfect<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:02.230> it<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.470> because<00:02:02.770> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
really perfect what it is because it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.270 
really perfect what it is because it's
fully<00:02:04.390> based<00:02:04.750> on<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.260> body<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.770> mean<00:02:06.130> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
fully based on your body I mean you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.400 
fully based on your body I mean you
don't<00:02:06.400> really<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.910> your<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.900> voice<00:02:08.229> to

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
don't really have your your voice to

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.380 
don't really have your your voice to
portray<00:02:08.830> your<00:02:09.280> character<00:02:09.729> until<00:02:10.210> it's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
portray your character until it's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.900 
portray your character until it's
finally<00:02:10.780> done<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.160> really<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.550> put

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
finally done so you really have to put

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.670 
finally done so you really have to put
everything<00:02:13.270> into<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:13.960> full<00:02:14.170> body<00:02:14.380> movement

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
everything into your full body movement

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.760 
everything into your full body movement
when<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.210> every<00:02:17.110> take<00:02:17.290> ever

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
when you have you know every take ever

00:02:17.770 --> 00:03:25.480 
when you have you know every take ever
takes<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.100> hundred<00:02:18.340> percent
