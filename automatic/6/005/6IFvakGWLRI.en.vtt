and<00:00:06.359> we're<00:00:06.779> gonna<00:00:06.870> say<00:00:07.109> if<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.830> matched<00:00:09.710> else

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
and we're gonna say if is matched else

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.700 
and we're gonna say if is matched else
we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.610> swapping<00:00:12.000> or<00:00:12.780> might<00:00:13.679> be

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
we're going to be swapping or might be

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.770 
we're going to be swapping or might be
swapping<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.240> not<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> be

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
swapping but we're not going to be

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.429 
swapping but we're not going to be
swapping<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.350> there's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.590> match<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:19.080> set<00:00:19.260> as

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
swapping if there's a match so we set as

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.340 
swapping if there's a match so we set as
matched<00:00:19.680> year<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.039> true<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.050> we're

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
matched year is true so in here we're

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.660 
matched year is true so in here we're
going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> set<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.220> false<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
going to have to set this to false so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.460 
going to have to set this to false so
that<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.449> comes<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.320> some

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that it actually comes out of it at some

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
that it actually comes out of it at some
point<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> future<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:29.000> what<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
point in the future and what we want to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:01:08.770 
point in the future and what we want to
do<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:33.480> want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.890> clear<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> error

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:20.620 

oh<00:01:09.860> yeah<00:01:11.420> whoops<00:01:14.390> not<00:01:15.390> his<00:01:15.630> less<00:01:15.869> than<00:01:17.360> right

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.030 

all<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.790> when<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.820> match<00:01:24.119> something<00:01:25.040> we

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
all right so when we match something we

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.600 
all right so when we match something we
want<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> move<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
want to move it from one of like this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.080 
want to move it from one of like this
location<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:31.530> its<00:01:31.860> corresponding<00:01:32.189> location

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
location to its corresponding location

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.990 
location to its corresponding location
up<00:01:33.240> top<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
up top and the way we're going to and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700 
up top and the way we're going to and
each<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.689> needs<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.590> unique

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
each one needs to have a unique

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
each one needs to have a unique
destination<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> otherwise<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.659> get

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
destination to go to otherwise they get

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.530 
destination to go to otherwise they get
a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:39.930> app<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.560> call<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:41.009> sort<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> error

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
a little app and call some sort of error

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.060 
a little app and call some sort of error
so<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.680> way<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
so the way we're going to do that is

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.109 
so the way we're going to do that is
we're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> loop<00:01:47.399> through<00:01:47.430> our<00:01:47.670> gem<00:01:47.880> list

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
we're going to loop through our gem list

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.450 
we're going to loop through our gem list
and<00:01:48.619> look<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> gems<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.340> are

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and look for all the gems that are

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:00.109 
and look for all the gems that are
matched<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.210> gems<00:01:57.750> sub<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.119> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
matched and then if gems sub I is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.270 
matched and then if gems sub I is
matched

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.050 

if<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.460> gem<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:03.760> matched<00:02:04.049> we're<00:02:05.049> going<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:06.060> go

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
if a gem is matched we're going to go

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.180 
if a gem is matched we're going to go
ahead<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:09.990> use<00:02:10.990> this<00:02:11.200> function<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.650> recreate

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
ahead and use this function to recreate

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.330 
ahead and use this function to recreate
the<00:02:12.400> gem<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:14.800> want<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.980> add<00:02:15.069> one<00:02:15.100> more

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the gem and we just want to add one more

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.190 
the gem and we just want to add one more
line<00:02:15.520> here<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.660> matched<00:02:16.959> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
line here and you see this matched is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.979 
line here and you see this matched is
false<00:02:18.060> because<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.390> don't<00:02:19.540> want<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> be

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
false because we don't want it to be

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.830 
false because we don't want it to be
true<00:02:20.319> anymore<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:21.819> want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> say<00:02:22.120> gems<00:02:22.390> so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
true anymore so we want to say gems so

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.690 
true anymore so we want to say gems so
I'd<00:02:25.440> create<00:02:26.440> gem<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.340> will<00:02:27.489> we

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
I'd create gem so this will we

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.949 
I'd create gem so this will we
randomized<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.840> gem<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:31.390> also<00:02:31.569> want<00:02:31.930> to

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
randomized the gem and we also want to

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.990 
randomized the gem and we also want to
move<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.380> upwards<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.900> gems<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.410> saw<00:02:39.000> transform

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
move it upwards so gems I saw transform

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.540 
move it upwards so gems I saw transform
the<00:02:40.630> top<00:02:40.870> position<00:02:41.500> equals<00:02:42.430> new<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:47.190> we<00:02:48.190> want

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
the top position equals new and we want

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.890 
the top position equals new and we want
to<00:02:49.530> keep<00:02:50.530> our<00:02:50.800> gems<00:02:51.100> transform<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:52.720> our

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
to keep our gems transform in our

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
to keep our gems transform in our
exposition<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:55.209> that's<00:02:55.360> not<00:02:55.480> changing

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
exposition because that's not changing

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
exposition because that's not changing
we<00:02:57.640> want<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.940> use<00:02:58.239> something<00:02:58.989> some<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.350> our

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
we want to use something some of our

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
we want to use something some of our
wire<00:02:59.739> transform<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.730> I'll<00:03:00.850> be<00:03:00.940> keeping<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
wire transform so I'll be keeping the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.570 
wire transform so I'll be keeping the
same<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.709> base<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.370> our

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
same so we can base it off of our

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.240 
same so we can base it off of our
transform<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.300> if<00:03:05.260> we<00:03:05.350> want<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> keep<00:03:05.709> our<00:03:05.830> Z

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
transform and if we want to keep our Z

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:25.140 
transform and if we want to keep our Z
transform<00:03:08.549> I'll<00:03:09.549> double<00:03:10.090> position<00:03:21.239> right<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
transform I'll double position right and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.809 
transform I'll double position right and
we<00:03:25.630> just

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
we just

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.050 
we just
going<00:03:25.939> to<00:03:25.999> add<00:03:26.379> six<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.730> we<00:03:28.819> would<00:03:28.939> add

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
going to add six to this so we would add

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.140 
going to add six to this so we would add
six<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.599> each<00:03:30.069> in<00:03:31.069> each<00:03:31.219> position<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.909> it's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
six to each in each position so it's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.569 
six to each in each position so it's
always<00:03:32.299> offset<00:03:32.840> by<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.260> amount<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:34.249> that<00:03:34.400> no

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
always offset by that amount so that no

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.569 
always offset by that amount so that no
two<00:03:35.150> positions<00:03:35.599> would<00:03:35.719> ever<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> same<00:03:39.579> so

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
two positions would ever be the same so

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.020 
two positions would ever be the same so
see<00:03:41.359> how<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.629> works<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:44.569> that's<00:03:46.030> it's

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
see how this works and that's it's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.800 
see how this works and that's it's
pretty<00:03:47.239> good<00:03:52.989> all<00:03:53.989> right<00:03:54.609> so<00:03:55.609> now<00:03:56.329> we<00:03:56.389> have

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
pretty good all right so now we have

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.069 
pretty good all right so now we have
some<00:03:57.260> simple<00:03:57.499> matching<00:03:57.859> logic<00:03:58.219> and<00:03:58.959> all<00:03:59.959> right

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
some simple matching logic and all right

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.069 
some simple matching logic and all right
I'll<00:04:00.319> talk<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.769> guys<00:04:00.859> later
