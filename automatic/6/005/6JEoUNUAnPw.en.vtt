instead<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.009> solve<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.670> problem

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
instead of going to solve the problem

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.080 
instead of going to solve the problem
and<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:05.020> providing<00:02:05.920> people<00:02:06.280> with<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.850> lower

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
and in providing people with a lower

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.540 
and in providing people with a lower
cost<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.960> health<00:02:08.229> care<00:02:08.349> what<00:02:09.220> they're<00:02:09.369> really

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
cost of health care what they're really

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.880 
cost of health care what they're really
doing<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:10.179> mandating<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.739> have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
doing is mandating that you have to have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.160 
doing is mandating that you have to have
health<00:02:12.220> care<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.209> you're<00:02:13.569> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.989> end

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
health care and that you're going to end

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.780 
health care and that you're going to end
up<00:02:14.319> with<00:02:14.380> what<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.770> get<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.489> what<00:02:15.670> my

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
up with what you get I know what my

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.880 
up with what you get I know what my
theory<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.540> look<00:02:17.050> at<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.440> way<00:02:17.500> I'll

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
theory is I look at it this way I'll

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.320 
theory is I look at it this way I'll
tell<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.610> came<00:02:21.670> up<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.209> I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
tell you what it if I came up if I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.699 
tell you what it if I came up if I
didn't<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:22.660> health<00:02:22.870> insurance<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.410> came<00:02:23.560> up

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
didn't have health insurance and came up

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.590 
didn't have health insurance and came up
with<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.920> catastrophic<00:02:24.220> industry<00:02:25.090> I'd<00:02:25.450> be

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
with a catastrophic industry I'd be

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.270 
with a catastrophic industry I'd be
looking<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.080> commit<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> crime<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:26.769> would<00:02:27.100> put

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
looking to commit a crime that would put

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.009 
looking to commit a crime that would put
me<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.489> jail<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.970> six<00:02:28.209> months<00:02:28.569> just<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.930> I

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
me in jail for six months just so I

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.680 
me in jail for six months just so I
could<00:02:29.110> get<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.440> taken<00:02:29.650> care<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:30.010> well<00:02:30.690> Howard

alone<00:03:07.269> look<00:03:08.079> at<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.769> was<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> personal

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
alone look at that that was the personal

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.229 
alone look at that that was the personal
piggy<00:03:09.730> bank<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.269> how<00:03:10.390> many<00:03:10.570> years<00:03:10.859> yeah<00:03:12.239> it's

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
piggy bank for how many years yeah it's

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.870 
piggy bank for how many years yeah it's
not<00:03:13.420> going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> be<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:13.930> when<00:03:14.109> I'm<00:03:14.230> old<00:03:14.880> yeah

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
not going to be there when I'm old yeah

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.610 
not going to be there when I'm old yeah
and<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.690> think<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.049> problem<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.530> you're

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
and I think the problem when you're

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.020 
and I think the problem when you're
right<00:03:17.829> about<00:03:17.980> that's<00:03:18.430> why<00:03:18.549> I've<00:03:18.640> been<00:03:18.730> saving

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
right about that's why I've been saving

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.880 
right about that's why I've been saving
for<00:03:19.180> 20<00:03:19.690> years<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.260> know<00:03:20.380> what<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.709> money

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
for 20 years and you know what the money

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.289 
for 20 years and you know what the money
that<00:03:21.070> are<00:03:21.250> putting<00:03:21.519> away<00:03:21.609> that's<00:03:22.030> already

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
that are putting away that's already

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.699 
that are putting away that's already
probably<00:03:22.750> gone<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:24.959> when<00:03:25.959> they<00:03:26.109> say<00:03:26.320> Charlie

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
probably gone to when they say Charlie

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.979 
probably gone to when they say Charlie
by<00:03:27.280> Amel<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> currency<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.540> future

hey<00:03:29.739> let's<00:03:30.010> get<00:03:30.190> more<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.640> expensive

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
hey let's get more and more expensive

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.220 
hey let's get more and more expensive
and<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:31.540> getting<00:03:31.750> harder<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.109> harder

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
and it's getting harder and harder

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.490 
and it's getting harder and harder
you're<00:03:32.590> fine<00:03:33.780> yeah<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.810> don't<00:03:35.049> think<00:03:35.200> I'm<00:03:35.410> we're

you're fine yeah I don't think I'm we're
going<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> think<00:03:35.859> our<00:03:35.980> gun<00:03:36.160> rights<00:03:36.190> away<00:03:36.609> but

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
going to think our gun rights away but

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.069 
going to think our gun rights away but
they<00:03:36.910> ain't<00:03:37.060> going<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.239> make<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.390> easy<00:03:37.630> for<00:03:37.989> us

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
they ain't going to make it easy for us

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.840 
they ain't going to make it easy for us
to<00:03:38.109> get<00:03:38.380> ammo

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
to get ammo

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.350 
to get ammo
they<00:03:40.330> can<00:03:40.600> they<00:03:41.020> they<00:03:41.920> just<00:03:42.160> might<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:43.120> got<00:03:43.270> to

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
they can they they just might you got to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.120 
they can they they just might you got to
bury<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.870> guns<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.530> ground<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.100> that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
bury your guns in the ground so that

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.030 
bury your guns in the ground so that
they<00:03:45.370> don't<00:03:45.490> find<00:03:45.850> them<00:03:46.350> well<00:03:47.350> we'll<00:03:47.590> never<00:03:47.770> be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
they don't find them well we'll never be

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.160 
they don't find them well we'll never be
able<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.400> really<00:03:49.180> revolt<00:03:49.690> against<00:03:50.020> this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
able to really revolt against this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.750 
able to really revolt against this
government<00:03:50.380> they're<00:03:50.830> too<00:03:50.950> powerful<00:03:51.160> they're

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
government they're too powerful they're

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.570 
government they're too powerful they're
too<00:03:51.910> big<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.770> think<00:03:53.770> that's<00:03:53.890> really<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.400> we
