00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.820
 I found myself city themes android puntonet 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.230
 we are here again with one plus 2 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.730
 this time we changed covers 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.040
 we have the kevlar one instead of the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.080
 sandstone that today we are here with the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.949
 our second and final focus is on 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.249
 this terminal 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.509
 we have already talked about the other day of 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.949
 performance and temperature therefore vi 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.779
 invitation if you have already seen the video ad 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.900
 go see it first after this a 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.460
 little as you prefer but today we talk 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.720
 instead of the camera another aspect 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.840
 that you will really be asked to 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.190
 lots of 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.140
 which therefore would seem to be on a par with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.269
 that of one plus one but not really 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.309
 it is in this focus we rattle off 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.469
 all the performances he has in 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.660
 conditions of good brightness in macro 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.699
 low light conditions at night 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.949
 and also in the panoramic and video ed 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.379
 finally we will also go to compare the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.050
 results with photos taken with 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.660
 one plus one to see the differences 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.600
 so before starting the last thing 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.670
 what I want to tell you is that if the video there 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.290
 like you can leave us a like here 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.310
 below that makes us really very happy 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.049
 and now this 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.479
 good vision let's start first 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.890
 with oxygen camera examination 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.460
 omitted proprietary application is 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.869
 present a small destiny to open 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.979
 the options you can go to take in 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.020
 clear picture hdr or retouching that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.329
 beauty mode you can set a 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.490
 delay in the car click or again 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.100
 go and put the flash as 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.780
 automatic enable or disable as you can 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.640
 obviously change camera with 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.619
 the front one and making a swipe from the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.369
 left edge you can give to choose 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.960
 the method of use 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.729
 obviously present for the photos 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.490
 the one for videos with settings 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.789
 to go and choose between 720p and 1080p 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.820
 or 4k you can then activate a life 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.110
 panorama to take panoramic pictures 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.869
 you have to do all of a sudden but it's not 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.509
 then so sensitive to the flickering is 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.509
 finally present to merit slow motion 120 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.869
 frame per second and 720p the novelty 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.939
 timelapse up to the 4th year to examine 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.950
 instead the quality of photos in daylight 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.679
 we see that the details are really 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.200
 lots of the 1.3 micron sensor of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.560
 one plus 2 will get your mind on capturing 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.510
 lots of details 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.599
 and the color quality among others is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.730
 really very good and the only flaw if 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.700
 we want to find an enel hdr and that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.040
 maybe he goes to shoot the greens a little too much 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.599
 and yellows as you can see but anyway 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.730
 succeeds very well in his work and 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.130
 manages to illuminate the shaded areas 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.540
 when we are against the sun apologizing 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.340
 instead in macros the quality of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.739
 details is really great this is 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.510
 the scope in which the one plus 2 camera 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.459
 really gives the best of you see 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 droplets first this flower 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.849
 even in this photo there was a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.170
 little ant that had settled on the flower is 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.269
 managed to focus a lot 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.040
 quickly and to capture many 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.630
 details here that it was not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.950
 obviously in favor of light 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.380
 the details are many and you see here that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.680
 in truly one plus 2 macros is a 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.630
 sample substance instead here that are the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.160
 photo in burglary lighting 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.810
 complete that performs well increases 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.390
 slightly noise but not much 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.049
 very wide peak data here which is 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.610
 only with the light of the room turned on not 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.069
 there are particular problems 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.739
 the details remain very very high e 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.690
 really the camera 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.370
 he also surprised me in these in these 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.989
 cases and moving instead in the photos of 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.120
 night obviously increases a lot 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.310
 noise but activating the image mode 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.480
 clear it goes to decrease the noise of 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.890
 bottom that is a bit we say flat 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.480
 slightly sacrificing maybe some 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.910
 detail however the photos remain 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.530
 very good with this mode e 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.840
 activating the flash instead 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.090
 I was really impressed by it 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.859
 this flash that illuminates everything well 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.989
 the environment not only subject not only the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.970
 bottom and therefore works well the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.980
 then 5 megapixel front camera 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.079
 does his duty by day while he lists 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.670
 works fine as soon as we go indoors 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.670
 increases background noise and at night 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.380
 practically increases a lot but oh well 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.660
 in short, the front cameras are 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.790
 made for this the panoramas are then 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.739
 very good the shooting interface is 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.470
 quite intuitive it doesn't suffer too much 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.609
 of the three piers and the quality remains much 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.739
 very good 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.790
 moving instead to a comparison with 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.579
 one plus one 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.320
 you see the quality of the details on 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.080
 one plus two is totally another thing 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.599
 they are both 13 megapixel but data 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.099
 chi peak are much wider 1.3 a 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.060
 micron on juan took two the amount of 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.710
 light absorbed 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.260
 then details that you can succeed a 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.510
 to perceive is practically on another 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.000
 level and compared to one plus one then 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.160
 there has been a noticeable improvement for 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.310
 regarding the camera 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.560
 especially in light conditions a 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.510
 let's say a little more precarious now 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.500
 seeing a video recording test 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.389
 at 1080p 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.270
 I remind you that they are present on the canal 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.560
 two trials of day and night at 4k though 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.419
 this was also requested 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.100
 so you can see a little bit like it 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.560
 involves the camera even at 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.510
 minor solutions and see that anyway 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.320
 the camera really catches many 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.200
 many details 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.889
 the only comment I can make is 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.610
 which is noticed every so often even when 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.650
 you don't change from macro to background 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.380
 maybe try to refocus more than 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.110
 how much it should really do and therefore 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.790
 the video is a bit spoiled by this 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.070
 what because there are too many and put back to the 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.440
 fire 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.110
 we say too often here is going into 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.880
 macro however as you see instead puts a 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.669
 fire the asphalt because it is grainy and 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.979
 so the camera does a bit of 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.720
 confusion but here going into macro on 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.280
 bicycle here as I told you 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.510
 first the macros soundly point 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.979
 Strong of this one plus 2 and I am not there 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.780
 problems of any kind 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.450
 now maybe I'll take mine off for a moment 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.240
 voice of the microphone and let me hear you 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.680
 how the voice is heard in the video 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.840
 logged in here that there was some 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:00.320
 echo of new area more clearer area 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.250
 dark and I would say for this performance 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.600
 video with its also all ok is 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.220
 here we are again with the microphone voice e 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.100
 the last part I would like to talk about is 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.680
 slow motion recording that 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:20.600
 captures several details is good at 720p 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.789
 in short, I found myself satisfied by 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.370
 this one plus 2 camera and so 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.539
 let's see the conclusions and 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.880
 here we are at that in ours 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.700
 video we have seen all the performances 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.830
 of the one plus 2 camera and vi 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.039
 I also remember that they are present on 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.210
 our youtube channel two 4k videos 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.340
 recorded with this camera 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.380
 go and see how it sees for example 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.319
 in addition to the one already seen in full hd 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.630
 here and also if you go to the article 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.569
 related to this photographic pocus 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.169
 find all the shots we have 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:56.180
 done and also a zip to download them and 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.150
 watch them from your PC at resolution a 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.800
 therefore create the camera itself 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.389
 confirmed really very good 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.930
 certainly superior to that of one 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.699
 plus one 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.000
 although megapixels are the same 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:13.039
 given the laser autofocus and acts the pixels 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.169
 give it 1,313 microns then very wide 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.930
 that really perform a lot of light 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.630
 and for the rest you have seen the shots 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.880
 you can download them from our blog 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.919
 and therefore judge yourself if it is appropriate 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.300
 yours if you prefer maybe one 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.910
 camera of some other smartphone 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.710
 top of the range for this focus is everything there 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.080
