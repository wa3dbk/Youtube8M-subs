00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.099
 very good drinks I put and others at 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.259
 channel today I will show you how to make us 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.869
 the eyebrows in a few steps very 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.550
 simple and also at the end of the video 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.130
 you have a heavy 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.039
 I start with him and kirsten prout pencil 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.929
 medium meter and I'm going to comb through my hair 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.000
 of the complaints down to have 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.640
 greater definition and greater clarity 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 time to fill it with the pencil outside 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.260
 filling your moment and foam and stay very 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 so we fill in the gaps 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.890
 comb again to blur the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.720
 product and with the brou things a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.820
 skewed brochita I will show the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.420
 product in wax with the product in 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.489
 powder 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.339
 and all this let's give the definition and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.350
 way and let's correct the way there 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.269
 that follow the guides from the fin the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.399
 nose to the beginning going through the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.799
 iris and by the end of the eye and so 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.930
 We will know where our points are on 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.820
 beginning of the end and the peak 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.820
 I have to extend a little 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.210
 I frame a little more the peak 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.820
 I'm making small strokes as if 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.280
 were like imitating some hair very 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.250
 little by little and with a little 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.930
 patience 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.930
 and it's like little strokes 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.420
 finally I return to comb the eyebrow 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.299
 with a precision brush and a 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.689
 corrector I'm going to give you a little more 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.789
 definition at the edges putting just 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.750
 by the edge a bit of corrector both 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.750
 above as below 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.490
 and this I do before the base of 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.780
 makeup if you do it later it 's better 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.210
 that you do it with the very basis of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.210
 makeup because that's how it looks 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.210
 integrated 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.659
 he founded it as a skin intruder 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.329
 with the speed brown that arises the fixer 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.470
 that brings very little color 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:45.380
 it is perfectly colored 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.600
 what we do is fix and do not move 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.990
 the eyebrows all day rather the 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.090
 hair totally in place and that would be 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.080
 the difference between the undone eyebrow and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.080
 the already made eyebrow 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.220
 well up here has been the step by step 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.930
 very simple easy as you see to me 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.540
 love how they look, I think it's very 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.240
 important make up and fill and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.400
 perfect the shape of the eyebrows that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.690
 they are the frame of the look and of a lot 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.850
 expressiveness and shape to the face 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.550
 as I said at the beginning you have 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.520
 surprise 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.680
 you have a lottery to run the three 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.200
 benefit products the only thing you have 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.130
