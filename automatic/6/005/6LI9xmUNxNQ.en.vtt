back<00:01:21.810> home<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.770> home<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.700> through<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
back home and the way home is through a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
back home and the way home is through a
portal<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> rely<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.820> external

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
portal and you have to rely on external

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.600 
portal and you have to rely on external
forces<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.350> move<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> portal

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
forces to move you into the portal

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
forces to move you into the portal
because<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.030> appears<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.509> though<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> moki's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because it appears as though the moki's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.899 
because it appears as though the moki's
can't<00:01:31.530> grow<00:01:31.740> legs<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> walk<00:01:32.400> through<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
can't grow legs and walk through the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
can't grow legs and walk through the
portal<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.439> things<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
portal so you do have to do things like

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.670 
portal so you do have to do things like
set<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> bomb<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.939> next<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> which

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
set a bomb right next to it and which

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
set a bomb right next to it and which
will<00:01:38.009> blow<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.610> force<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> mochi<00:01:39.869> into

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
will blow up and force the mochi into

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.929 
will blow up and force the mochi into
the<00:01:40.380> portal<00:01:40.740> once<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> gets<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> portal

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the portal once it gets to the portal

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
the portal once it gets to the portal
will<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.150> sent<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:42.540> home<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.140> that's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
will be sent back home and that's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679 
will be sent back home and that's
basically<00:01:44.040> how<00:01:44.280> oldie<00:01:44.640> game<00:01:44.820> rolls<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.479> it's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
basically how oldie game rolls so it's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
basically how oldie game rolls so it's
very<00:01:45.899> fun<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> play<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.490> series<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
very fun to play you get a series of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
very fun to play you get a series of
levels<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> does<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.140> very<00:01:49.200> complicated

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
levels and it does get very complicated

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.969 
levels and it does get very complicated
after<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.759> first<00:01:51.119> world<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.619> they'll

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
after about that first world and they'll

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
after about that first world and they'll
do<00:01:53.220> things<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.610> add<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.090> Mokey's<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.750> add

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
do things like add more Mokey's and add

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.800 
do things like add more Mokey's and add
more<00:01:55.110> things<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:56.009> such<00:01:56.340> as

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
more things that you can do such as

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.940 
more things that you can do such as
instead<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.110> having<00:01:58.259> bombs<00:01:58.619> they'll

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
instead of just having bombs they'll

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
instead of just having bombs they'll
have<00:01:59.130> things<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.670> allow<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> mochi<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
have things that allow the mochi to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.050 
have things that allow the mochi to
stick<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> objects

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
stick to objects

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
stick to objects
it'll<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> long<00:02:03.600> course<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.439> cases

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it'll be a long course in some cases

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.249 
it'll be a long course in some cases
when<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.240> further<00:02:06.719> further<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> we're

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
when you go further further on and we're

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.259 
when you go further further on and we're
one<00:02:08.560> or<00:02:08.890> any<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.519> other<00:02:09.670> worlds<00:02:10.149> and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
one or any of the other worlds and

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.449 
one or any of the other worlds and
levels<00:02:10.629> you<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.349> notice<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.129> does<00:02:12.310> get

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
levels you will notice that it does get

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.250 
levels you will notice that it does get
very<00:02:12.760> hard<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.329> you<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> play<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.989> you<00:02:14.079> have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
very hard for you to play and you have

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.809 
very hard for you to play and you have
to<00:02:14.379> go<00:02:14.470> back<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.829> have<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.950> retry<00:02:15.430> over

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
to go back and you have to retry over

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.360 
to go back and you have to retry over
and<00:02:15.939> over<00:02:16.120> again<00:02:16.209> until<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:17.049> get<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.829> right

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
and over again until you get the right

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.339 
and over again until you get the right
solution<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.420> problem<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.930> which<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:20.230> can

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
solution to the problem in which you can

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.229 
solution to the problem in which you can
actually<00:02:20.650> direct<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.069> mo<00:02:21.489> keys<00:02:21.700> into<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
actually direct the mo keys into the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.509 
actually direct the mo keys into the
portal<00:02:22.689> so<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.799> are<00:02:23.829> three<00:02:24.280> star

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
portal so there you are three star

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.890 
portal so there you are three star
rating<00:02:24.730> how<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> get<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.420> ratings<00:02:25.720> is

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
rating how you get the ratings is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.479 
rating how you get the ratings is
basically<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.680> rates<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:26.950> upon<00:02:27.220> how<00:02:27.430> many

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
basically it rates you upon how many

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.280 
basically it rates you upon how many
flowers<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.329> collect<00:02:28.540> within<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.079> game

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
flowers you can collect within the game

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.130 
flowers you can collect within the game
and<00:02:30.220> also<00:02:30.610> how<00:02:30.879> fast<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.569> complete<00:02:31.989> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and also how fast you can complete the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.630 
and also how fast you can complete the
level<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.829> here's<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> harder

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
level and here's one of the harder

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.670 
level and here's one of the harder
levels<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.060> was<00:02:34.209> talking<00:02:34.540> about<00:02:34.599> level<00:02:35.109> 19

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
levels I was talking about level 19

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.309 
levels I was talking about level 19
within<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.280> first<00:02:36.940> planet<00:02:37.480> basically<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
within the first planet basically it's a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.220 
within the first planet basically it's a
longer<00:02:38.560> level<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.760> which<00:02:39.909> involves<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> lot<00:02:41.049> of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
longer level in which involves a lot of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.309 
longer level in which involves a lot of
flying<00:02:42.159> of<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.670> mochi<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> lot<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.510> very

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
flying of the mochi and a lot of very

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.740 
flying of the mochi and a lot of very
very<00:02:44.709> accurate<00:02:45.250> directs<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.389> basically

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
very accurate directs so basically

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.869 
very accurate directs so basically
you'll<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.409> put<00:02:48.010> certain<00:02:48.280> things<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.819> a

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
you'll have to put certain things in a

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.849 
you'll have to put certain things in a
certain<00:02:49.030> area<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.450> even<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.109> it's<00:02:50.260> running<00:02:50.680> it

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
certain area and even if it's running it

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.640 
certain area and even if it's running it
bit<00:02:51.280> off<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:52.510> will<00:02:52.720> actually<00:02:53.170> miss<00:02:53.409> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
bit off you will actually miss the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.379 
bit off you will actually miss the
object<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.190> you're<00:02:54.310> supposed<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.730> hit<00:02:54.879> so<00:02:55.359> I

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
object that you're supposed to hit so I

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.940 
object that you're supposed to hit so I
just<00:02:55.569> put<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.989> bomb<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.769> then<00:02:56.859> I'm

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
just put down a bomb there and then I'm

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.069 
just put down a bomb there and then I'm
gonna<00:02:57.040> hit<00:02:57.280> put<00:02:57.609> down<00:02:57.819> some<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.359> these<00:02:58.480> orange

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.349 
gonna hit put down some of these orange
bombs<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.310> which<00:03:00.430> will<00:03:00.579> explode<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.239> they'll

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
bombs and which will explode and they'll

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.750 
bombs and which will explode and they'll
actually<00:03:01.480> leave<00:03:01.870> paint<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.250> ground<00:03:03.549> which

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
actually leave paint on the ground which

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.460 
actually leave paint on the ground which
will<00:03:03.909> make<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.239> mochi<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.720> faster<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.319> here's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
will make the mochi go faster and here's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.690 
will make the mochi go faster and here's
a<00:03:05.530> green<00:03:05.769> bomb<00:03:06.040> which<00:03:06.310> will<00:03:06.430> actually<00:03:06.549> make

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
a green bomb which will actually make

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.210 
a green bomb which will actually make
the<00:03:06.970> mochi<00:03:07.180> stick<00:03:07.659> to<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.959> object<00:03:08.409> above<00:03:08.650> so

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the mochi stick to that object above so

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.979 
the mochi stick to that object above so
the<00:03:09.250> mochi<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.639> gonna<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.940> launched<00:03:10.389> sticking

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
the mochi is gonna be launched sticking

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.869 
the mochi is gonna be launched sticking
that<00:03:11.079> green<00:03:11.440> object<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.099> it's<00:03:12.250> gonna<00:03:12.370> fly

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
that green object and it's gonna fly

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.339 
that green object and it's gonna fly
over<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.329> hope<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> gets<00:03:14.079> in<00:03:14.230> there

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
over and I hope that it gets in there

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.420 
over and I hope that it gets in there
but<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.620> appears<00:03:14.859> as<00:03:14.980> though<00:03:15.099> it's<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.370> going

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
but it appears as though it's not going

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.670 
but it appears as though it's not going
to<00:03:15.879> it's<00:03:16.389> just<00:03:16.540> gonna<00:03:16.629> hit<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.900> rock<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
to it's just gonna hit that rock the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.559 
to it's just gonna hit that rock the
rock<00:03:17.859> is<00:03:18.040> gonna<00:03:18.250> go<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.269> mochi

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
rock is gonna go in but then the mochi

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.150 
rock is gonna go in but then the mochi
will<00:03:19.750> not<00:03:19.870> fall<00:03:20.109> because<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> did<00:03:20.739> not<00:03:20.859> place<00:03:21.129> a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
will not fall because I did not place a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.150 
will not fall because I did not place a
bomb<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:22.150> knock<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.750> mochi<00:03:23.169> off<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:24.010> it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
bomb to knock the mochi off so it's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.800 
bomb to knock the mochi off so it's
trial<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.549> error<00:03:24.699> over<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.269> over<00:03:25.419> again<00:03:25.660> if

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
trial and error over and over again if

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.479 
trial and error over and over again if
you<00:03:25.930> cannot<00:03:26.169> find<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.620> solution<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.220> level

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
you cannot find the solution of a level

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.860 
you cannot find the solution of a level
they<00:03:27.609> have<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.940> option<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.449> which<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.690> can

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
they have the option in which you can

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.289 
they have the option in which you can
buy<00:03:29.079> with<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.919> mochi<00:03:30.280> coins<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.970> which<00:03:31.120> you'll

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
buy with a mochi coins in which you'll

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.110 
buy with a mochi coins in which you'll
be<00:03:31.329> able<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.840> buy<00:03:32.650> solutions<00:03:33.370> from<00:03:33.849> other

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
be able to buy solutions from other

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.619 
be able to buy solutions from other
players<00:03:34.389> or<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.079> actual<00:03:35.560> solution<00:03:35.980> that

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
players or the actual solution that

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.150 
players or the actual solution that
developer<00:03:37.629> has<00:03:37.959> given<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.739> here's<00:03:38.919> where

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
developer has given you and here's where

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.589 
developer has given you and here's where
the<00:03:39.190> level<00:03:39.639> sharing<00:03:39.940> comes<00:03:40.180> into<00:03:40.419> play<00:03:40.569> you

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
the level sharing comes into play you

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.210 
the level sharing comes into play you
actually<00:03:41.079> have<00:03:41.199> the<00:03:41.319> option<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.829> create<00:03:42.040> your

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
actually have the option to create your

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.369 
actually have the option to create your
own<00:03:42.430> levels<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.599> if<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.810> ever<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.199> through

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
own levels so if you ever get through

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.900 
own levels so if you ever get through
all<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.829> levels<00:03:45.160> which<00:03:45.370> like<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.609> said<00:03:45.730> is

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
all the levels which like I said is

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.699 
all the levels which like I said is
hours<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.510> hours<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.930> gameplay<00:03:47.139> if<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.530> play

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
hours and hours of gameplay if you play

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.729 
hours and hours of gameplay if you play
non-stop<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:48.940> hours<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:50.169> I've<00:03:50.319> been<00:03:50.500> playing

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
non-stop for hours and I've been playing

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.710 
non-stop for hours and I've been playing
for<00:03:50.859> a<00:03:50.919> couple<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.250> hours<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:52.060> still<00:03:52.510> have

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
for a couple of hours and I still have

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.500 
for a couple of hours and I still have
yet<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.989> get<00:03:53.650> at<00:03:54.430> least<00:03:54.609> half<00:03:54.849> of<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.209> levels

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
yet to get at least half of the levels

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.629 
yet to get at least half of the levels
over<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.560> here's<00:03:56.739> what<00:03:56.889> you<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.159> you<00:03:57.190> basically

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
over so here's what you do you basically

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.750 
over so here's what you do you basically
you<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.909> lay<00:03:58.180> down<00:03:58.209> platforms<00:03:59.049> rocks<00:03:59.760> circles

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
you can lay down platforms rocks circles

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.430 
you can lay down platforms rocks circles
they're<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.239> different<00:04:01.540> sorts<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.930> shapes

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
they're all in different sorts of shapes

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.349 
they're all in different sorts of shapes
you<00:04:02.620> can<00:04:02.829> change<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.310> sizes<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.120> shapes

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
you can change the sizes of the shapes

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.839 
you can change the sizes of the shapes
and<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.900> as<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:05.049> guys<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.440> see<00:04:05.500> here<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.519> a

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
and so on as you guys can see here is a

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.599 
and so on as you guys can see here is a
rock<00:04:07.150> there<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.500> basically<00:04:08.859> you<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.430> move

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
rock there and basically you can move

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.110 
rock there and basically you can move
them<00:04:09.790> accurately<00:04:10.419> like<00:04:10.629> that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
them accurately like that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.610 
them accurately like that
little<00:04:11.360> points<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:11.870> which<00:04:11.959> you<00:04:12.110> can<00:04:12.260> stretch

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
little points in which you can stretch

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.399 
little points in which you can stretch
it<00:04:12.799> out<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.599> go<00:04:14.720> ahead<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.019> check

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
it out and you can go ahead and check

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.199 
it out and you can go ahead and check
lay<00:04:15.680> down<00:04:15.709> your<00:04:15.890> mochi<00:04:16.430> wherever<00:04:16.729> you<00:04:16.940> want

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
lay down your mochi wherever you want

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.390 
lay down your mochi wherever you want
and<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:18.079> can<00:04:18.199> also<00:04:18.320> put<00:04:18.680> down<00:04:18.709> their<00:04:19.010> portal

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
and you can also put down their portal

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.129 
and you can also put down their portal
wherever<00:04:19.699> you<00:04:19.850> want<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.299> can<00:04:20.479> select<00:04:20.750> the

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
wherever you want and you can select the

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.800 
wherever you want and you can select the
things<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.769> you<00:04:21.889> want<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.520> be<00:04:22.790> used<00:04:23.090> for<00:04:23.690> that

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
things that you want to be used for that

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.990 
things that you want to be used for that
person<00:04:24.320> so<00:04:24.590> basically<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:25.639> make<00:04:25.880> your

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
person so basically you just make your

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.879 
person so basically you just make your
own<00:04:26.060> levels<00:04:26.570> which<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.840> very<00:04:27.050> nice<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.500> how

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
so here I am missing the bomb they're

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.790 
so here I am missing the bomb they're
hoping<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.810> it'll<00:04:50.960> launch<00:04:51.139> over<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.680> the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
hoping that it'll launch over to the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.540 
hoping that it'll launch over to the
other<00:04:51.949> platform<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.789> have<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:58.220> do<00:04:58.370> that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
other platform is that I have to do that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.730 
other platform is that I have to do that
because<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.060> made<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.660> so<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.080> platform's

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
because I made it so the platform's

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.980 
because I made it so the platform's
would<00:05:01.010> both<00:05:01.220> fall<00:05:01.580> which<00:05:01.880> kinda<00:05:02.419> was<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.720> fail

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
would both fall which kinda was a fail

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.409 
would both fall which kinda was a fail
on<00:05:03.020> my<00:05:03.380> behalf<00:05:03.789> so<00:05:04.789> yeah<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.000> can<00:05:05.210> basically

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
on my behalf so yeah you can basically

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.029 
on my behalf so yeah you can basically
just<00:05:05.720> create<00:05:06.050> your<00:05:06.080> own<00:05:06.229> levels<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.710> can<00:05:06.830> add

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
just create your own levels you can add

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.159 
just create your own levels you can add
different<00:05:07.729> platforms<00:05:08.449> different<00:05:08.750> things

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
that the levels can do overall different

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.120 
that the levels can do overall different
