00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
Health Center dr. Eugene thanks for

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.420 
Health Center dr. Eugene thanks for
joining<00:00:15.750> me<00:00:15.870> thanks<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.470> having<00:00:16.710> me<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.250> let's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
joining me thanks for having me so let's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.670 
joining me thanks for having me so let's
start<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.699> by<00:00:17.820> talking<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.330> epilepsy<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
start off by talking about epilepsy and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
start off by talking about epilepsy and
how<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> started<00:00:21.000> any<00:00:21.270> age<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
how it can start it started any age and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
how it can start it started any age and
it<00:00:22.260> may<00:00:22.439> develop<00:00:22.650> even<00:00:23.130> though<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.519> don't

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it may develop even though you don't

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
it may develop even though you don't
have<00:00:23.910> any<00:00:24.330> risk<00:00:24.660> factors<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.439> true

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
have any risk factors it's true

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.099 
have any risk factors it's true
correct<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.519> epilepsy<00:00:27.180> tends<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
correct so epilepsy tends to have a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
correct so epilepsy tends to have a
higher<00:00:28.470> incidence<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.300> children<00:00:30.300> sometimes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
higher incidence in children sometimes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
higher incidence in children sometimes
adolescents<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:31.859> well<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.070> patients<00:00:32.489> over<00:00:32.759> age

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
adolescents as well as patients over age

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.110 
adolescents as well as patients over age
65<00:00:33.710> oftentimes<00:00:34.710> when<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.460> seen<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:35.940> your

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
65 oftentimes when you are seen by your

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.200 
65 oftentimes when you are seen by your
provider<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:37.340> neurologist<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.969> an

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
provider or neurologist we do an

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
provider or neurologist we do an
evaluation<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.930> sometimes<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.469> find

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
evaluation and sometimes we don't find

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
evaluation and sometimes we don't find
anything<00:00:41.010> probably<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> biggest<00:00:42.210> piece<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
anything probably the biggest piece of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
anything probably the biggest piece of
information<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.800> history<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
information that we have is history and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
information that we have is history and
what<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> patient's<00:00:45.629> behavior<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.140> during

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
what the patient's behavior is during

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
what the patient's behavior is during
their<00:00:47.100> seizure<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.090> often<00:00:48.719> times<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.020> tell

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
their seizure so often times I tell

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
their seizure so often times I tell
patients<00:00:49.350> when<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.739> come<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> office<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
patients when they come to the office to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549 
patients when they come to the office to
come<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.449> someone<00:00:51.840> who<00:00:51.989> has<00:00:52.170> seen<00:00:52.379> their

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
come in with someone who has seen their

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
come in with someone who has seen their
seizures<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> good

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
seizures so that we can get a good

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.610 
seizures so that we can get a good
description<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.870> doctor<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
description of them doctor what can

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
description of them doctor what can
trigger<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.250> seizure<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.230> things<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
trigger a seizure so on some things can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
trigger a seizure so on some things can
lower<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:59.160> threshold<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.059> seizure<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
lower your threshold for seizure and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
lower your threshold for seizure and
those<00:01:00.840> one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> big<00:01:01.590> ones<00:01:01.800> tends<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> be

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
those one of the big ones tends to be

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
those one of the big ones tends to be
sleep<00:01:02.609> deprivation<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.359> fact<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.229> don't

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sleep deprivation in fact if you don't

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.660 
sleep deprivation in fact if you don't
get<00:01:04.890> enough<00:01:05.129> sleep<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
get enough sleep and you have a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
get enough sleep and you have a
predisposition<00:01:05.970> towards<00:01:06.750> seizure<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> can

be associated with seizure

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.899 
be associated with seizure
sometimes<00:01:09.570> alcohol<00:01:10.250> can<00:01:11.250> also<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.640> associated

sometimes alcohol can also be associated
with<00:01:12.330> seizure<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> there's<00:01:13.290> no<00:01:13.500> known<00:01:13.710> cure

with seizure and there's no known cure
for<00:01:14.490> epilepsy<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.299> talk<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.810> medication

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
for epilepsy but talk about medication

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
for epilepsy but talk about medication
is<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.650> effective<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.820> extent

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
is that effective and to what extent

is that effective and to what extent
correct<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> cure<00:01:20.070> for

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
correct we do not have a cure for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.090 
correct we do not have a cure for
epilepsy<00:01:20.310> yet<00:01:20.909> there's<00:01:21.600> research<00:01:22.049> hoping<00:01:22.830> to

the<00:01:44.880> collarbone<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.560> sends<00:01:46.950> impulses

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the collarbone and that sends impulses

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
the collarbone and that sends impulses
to<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> nerve<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.180> neck<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> could

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to a nerve in the neck and so that could

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.679 
to a nerve in the neck and so that could
be<00:01:49.380> another<00:01:49.649> modality<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.820> treatment<00:01:50.909> there

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
be another modality of treatment there

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
be another modality of treatment there
are<00:01:51.750> generalized<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.640> yeah<00:01:53.820> that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
are generalized or I would yeah that's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.429 
are generalized or I would yeah that's
right<00:01:54.180> generalized<00:01:54.689> seizures<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.320> what

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
right generalized seizures that's what

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.690 
right generalized seizures that's what
they're<00:01:55.590> referred<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> there's<00:01:56.610> also

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
they're referred to but and there's also

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
they're referred to but and there's also
partial<00:01:57.240> seizures<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:58.020> well<00:01:58.290> talk<00:01:58.530> about<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
partial seizures as well talk about the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
partial seizures as well talk about the
difference<00:01:59.250> between<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> two<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.450> can

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
difference between the two so you can

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
difference between the two so you can
have<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.049> seizure<00:02:01.259> Carmy<00:02:01.710> from<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> part<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
have a seizure Carmy from a part of the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.010 
have a seizure Carmy from a part of the
brain<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.360> call<00:02:03.570> those<00:02:03.689> partial

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
brain and so we call those partial

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
brain and so we call those partial
verses<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> seizure<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> involves<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
verses a seizure that involves the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.670 
verses a seizure that involves the
entire<00:02:06.240> brain<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> onset<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.409> those<00:02:07.560> are

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
entire brain at the onset and those are

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
entire brain at the onset and those are
generalized<00:02:08.160> seizures<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> partial

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
generalized seizures with a partial

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.540 
generalized seizures with a partial
partial<00:02:10.410> seizures<00:02:10.679> sometimes<00:02:11.039> may<00:02:11.190> present

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
partial seizures sometimes may present

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
partial seizures sometimes may present
in<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> very<00:02:11.730> bland<00:02:12.330> man

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
in a very bland man

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.960 
in a very bland man
sometimes<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.800> Eagle<00:02:13.950> witnessed<00:02:14.550> or

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
sometimes the Eagle witnessed or

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.700 
sometimes the Eagle witnessed or
unnoticed<00:02:15.510> by<00:02:15.630> family<00:02:15.990> for<00:02:16.200> an<00:02:16.260> extensive

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
unnoticed by family for an extensive

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.650 
unnoticed by family for an extensive
amount<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.070> time<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.790> those<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.150> consist<00:02:18.540> of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
amount of time so those can consist of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.310 
amount of time so those can consist of
bland<00:02:19.530> staring<00:02:20.340> lips<00:02:21.120> smacking<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.840> funny

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
bland staring lips smacking of funny

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.710 
bland staring lips smacking of funny
picking<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.920> movements<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.540> those

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
picking like movements and so those

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.930 
picking like movements and so those
partial<00:02:25.380> seizures<00:02:25.650> may<00:02:25.890> at<00:02:26.040> times<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.400> that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
partial seizures may at times have that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.270 
partial seizures may at times have that
kind<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.330> subtle<00:02:27.630> presentation<00:02:28.350> compared<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
kind of subtle presentation compared to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.890 
kind of subtle presentation compared to
the<00:02:29.580> generalized<00:02:30.000> seizures<00:02:30.330> which<00:02:30.570> may

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the generalized seizures which may

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.780 
the generalized seizures which may
present<00:02:31.080> typically<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> convulsion<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
present typically with a convulsion and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
present typically with a convulsion and
that<00:02:32.940> tends<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.270> be<00:02:33.420> more<00:02:33.600> readily

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
that tends to be more readily

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.320 
that tends to be more readily
recognizable<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.700> witness<00:02:36.090> someone

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
recognizable when you witness someone

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.030 
recognizable when you witness someone
having<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.750> seizure<00:02:36.959> what's<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.530> best<00:02:37.800> thing

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
having a seizure what's the best thing

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.740 
having a seizure what's the best thing
to<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.280> how<00:02:38.430> should<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> react<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.600> perhaps

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
to do how should you react and perhaps

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.570 
to do how should you react and perhaps
maybe<00:02:40.140> help<00:02:40.350> them<00:02:40.470> out<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.830> let<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.370> be

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
maybe help them out do you let them be

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
maybe help them out do you let them be
what<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.570> right<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.530> to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
what would you do right so you want to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.900 
what would you do right so you want to
try<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> patient<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> position

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
try to put the patient in a position

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.360 
try to put the patient in a position
that<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:46.140> would<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.350> safe<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.130> can

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that is that would be safe so you can

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.979 
that is that would be safe so you can
turn<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.700> over<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.940> their<00:02:48.150> side<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.840> can

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
turn them over to their side you can

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.540 
turn them over to their side you can
remove<00:02:49.230> sharp<00:02:49.620> objects<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.190> they're<00:02:50.340> near<00:02:50.489> a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
remove sharp objects if they're near a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.160 
remove sharp objects if they're near a
sharp<00:02:50.910> table<00:02:51.300> or<00:02:51.390> sharp<00:02:51.630> objects<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.020> want<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
sharp table or sharp objects you want to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.110 
sharp table or sharp objects you want to
remove<00:02:52.380> those<00:02:52.530> objects<00:02:53.010> from<00:02:53.130> them<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.820> want

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
remove those objects from them you want

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.580 
remove those objects from them you want
to<00:02:54.239> refrain<00:02:54.630> from<00:02:54.660> putting<00:02:54.989> objects<00:02:55.380> in<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
to refrain from putting objects in the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.750 
to refrain from putting objects in the
mouth<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.010> would<00:02:56.130> turn<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> patient<00:02:56.670> over

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
mouth you would turn the patient over

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360 
mouth you would turn the patient over
that<00:02:57.000> helps<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.330> get<00:02:57.420> air<00:02:57.660> pathways<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
that helps to get air pathways as the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.100 
that helps to get air pathways as the
seizure<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.730> ongoing<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.660> good<00:03:00.810> thing<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
seizure is ongoing and a good thing to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.710 
seizure is ongoing and a good thing to
do<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.380> also<00:03:01.620> time<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.100> seizure<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.720> often

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
do is also time the seizure and often

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080 
do is also time the seizure and often
times<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> pretty<00:03:04.560> dramatic<00:03:05.520> event

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
times it can be a pretty dramatic event

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.880 
times it can be a pretty dramatic event
for<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> person<00:03:07.020> witnessing<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.530> event<00:03:07.770> but

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
for the person witnessing the event but

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.340 
for the person witnessing the event but
if<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.510> sort<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.570> assess<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> patient's

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
if you can sort of assess the patient's

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.660 
if you can sort of assess the patient's
behavior<00:03:10.620> during<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.130> seizure<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.550> is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
behavior during the seizure that is

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.400 
behavior during the seizure that is
often<00:03:12.000> helpful<00:03:12.300> information<00:03:12.540> once<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.110> phot

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
often helpful information once the phot

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.530 
often helpful information once the phot
goes<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.739> emergency<00:03:13.920> room<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:15.180> seen<00:03:15.390> by
