00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it all the way up I usually keep it down

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.710 
it all the way up I usually keep it down
on<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> low<00:01:31.079> setting<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> also

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
on a low setting and then it also

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
on a low setting and then it also
charges<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.070> keep<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
charges so you don't have to keep it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
charges so you don't have to keep it
plugged<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> time<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.409> great

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
plugged in all the time which is great

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
plugged in all the time which is great
if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> bring<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.119> know

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
if you want to bring it on the you know

on the go and I've been using it for a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
on the go and I've been using it for a
few<00:01:45.450> weeks<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:46.009> just<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.220> been<00:01:47.250> doing
