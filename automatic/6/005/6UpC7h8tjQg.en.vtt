and<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.049> all<00:02:59.170> starts<00:02:59.560> from<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> steering

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
and that all starts from a steering

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.069 
and that all starts from a steering
wheel<00:03:00.220> right<00:03:00.940> through<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.299> hole<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.690> rack<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
wheel right through the hole the rack to

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.229 
wheel right through the hole the rack to
the<00:03:02.110> front<00:03:02.319> but<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:03.129> real<00:03:03.280> sit<00:03:03.489> really<00:03:03.849> also

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
the front but it it real sit really also

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.509 
the front but it it real sit really also
depends<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.900> having<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.349> very<00:03:05.560> stiff<00:03:05.950> platforms
