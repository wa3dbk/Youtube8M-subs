00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
put it in the sun oven and it will

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
put it in the sun oven and it will

hydrate without boiling the water first
the<00:01:08.220> Sun<00:01:08.460> Oven<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:08.970> used<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.420> any<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
the Sun Oven can be used for any kind of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.050 
the Sun Oven can be used for any kind of
cooking<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.620> than<00:01:10.890> frying<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.760> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cooking other than frying and it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
cooking other than frying and it's
wonderful<00:01:12.480> to<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.870> used<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> solar<00:01:13.710> dryer<00:01:14.100> or

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
wonderful to be used as a solar dryer or

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.180 
wonderful to be used as a solar dryer or
Solar<00:01:15.030> dehydrator<00:01:15.300> in<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.530> Sun<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.010> will<00:01:17.070> get

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
Solar dehydrator in good Sun it will get

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.890 
Solar dehydrator in good Sun it will get
up<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> temperatures<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.120> high<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.630> 400

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
up to temperatures as high as 400

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
up to temperatures as high as 400
degrees<00:01:19.350> Fahrenheit<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.640> pretty

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
degrees Fahrenheit so you can pretty

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.610 
degrees Fahrenheit so you can pretty
well<00:01:20.909> cook<00:01:21.270> anything<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:22.050> you<00:01:22.140> cook<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
well cook anything when you cook in the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.500 
well cook anything when you cook in the
Sun<00:01:22.860> Oven<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.190> reason<00:01:23.490> nothing<00:01:23.700> burns<00:01:24.120> is

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
Sun Oven the reason nothing burns is

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.240 
Sun Oven the reason nothing burns is
that<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> entire<00:01:25.229> chamber<00:01:25.620> is<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> same

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that the entire chamber is the same

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
that the entire chamber is the same
temperature<00:01:26.760> so<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.900> food<00:01:28.170> inside<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.860> pot

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
temperature so the food inside the pot

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.070 
temperature so the food inside the pot
the<00:01:29.460> pot<00:01:29.670> itself<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.390> air<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
the pot itself and the air around the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.930 
the pot itself and the air around the
pot<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.650> exactly<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:32.340> temperature

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
pot are all exactly the same temperature

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.149 
pot are all exactly the same temperature
so<00:01:33.540> consequently<00:01:34.170> nothing<00:01:34.590> burns<00:01:34.830> if<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
so consequently nothing burns if you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
so consequently nothing burns if you
think<00:01:35.370> of<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.490> contrasted<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.960> stovetop

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
think of that contrasted to a stovetop

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
think of that contrasted to a stovetop
where<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> transferring<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.120> heat

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
where you would be transferring the heat

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670 
where you would be transferring the heat
from<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> stove<00:01:39.690> burner<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> path<00:01:40.440> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
from the stove burner to the path the

only<00:04:49.289> part<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.800> oven<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.189> gets<00:04:50.400> not<00:04:50.669> is

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
only part of the oven that gets not is

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.390 
only part of the oven that gets not is
the<00:04:51.090> surface<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.750> glass<00:04:52.020> if<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.740> 350

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
the surface of the glass if it's 350

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.920 
the surface of the glass if it's 350
degrees<00:04:53.699> inside<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> oven<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.599> outside

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
degrees inside the oven the outside

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.270 
degrees inside the oven the outside
temperature<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.439> the<00:04:55.530> glass<00:04:55.770> gets<00:04:56.009> to<00:04:56.159> be

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
temperature of the glass gets to be

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.619 
temperature of the glass gets to be
about<00:04:56.370> 155<00:04:58.159> so<00:04:59.159> the<00:04:59.310> entire<00:04:59.550> oven<00:04:59.849> is<00:05:00.270> very

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
about 155 so the entire oven is very

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.080 
about 155 so the entire oven is very
durable<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.620> built<00:05:02.009> to<00:05:02.310> have<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> very<00:05:02.819> long
