00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.110
 through the seen cocoa 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 Dragon Ball Z 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.990
 I'm frank hello, it's me, she should talk 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.180
 of the mastermind behind the dragon 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.869
 ball the incredible wonderful and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.649
 stupidly attractive akira toriyama 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.439
 Akira for the four of April 5 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.489
 1955 in the fourth largest city in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.300
 Japan 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.790
 nagoya give yourself a little baby called koi 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.100
 call acquire that forty years 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 later it would be recognized worldwide 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.950
 the games at his 19 years in all the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 Industrial high school and almost almost 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 at that time he was hired by a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 advertising agency but as good 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.680
 creative had big problems with his 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 bosses so I gave up on undoing sleeves 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 for nyon action the first ones were 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.720
 awards and my wind yak feet that was a 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.670
 parody of star wars but not currently 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.670
 they are conserved and they have already been lost 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 then he came to his leap to fame with 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 tÃ©lam and him as a short story 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.820
 called dragon boy but he managed to make a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.250
 reworking called dragon ball and yes 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.620
 he was very famous in japan and some 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 countries but it was not until the creation of 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.490
 the animes of these two sleeves that the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.030
 Fame of the incredible wonderful and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 stupidly sensual akira toriyama 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.540
 it grew exponentially and it became 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.540
 global 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 now we must emphasize that the way of 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.080
 the story led me to such led in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.479
 Japan that he and his family can hardly 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.510
 leave your house there have been meetings of 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.040
 fanatics outside of that hatoyama house 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.260
 just to see if they see him crossing to the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.869
 abyss caravans from your home to 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.880
 airport when you go on a trip see more 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.550
 of physicists and an interview with the badger 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.709
 Kim Jong-Hun though he does not threaten 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.709
 exploit your country by little 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.909
 currently akira students 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.069
 toriyama are very successful with 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.209
 its new to levels some of them 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.510
 They're strong 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.489
 Naruto want is rich and panic where 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.010
 can you see the bastard church in the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.049
 clothes of these who have the same 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.079
 principles that dragon ball comedies 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.730
 fight food and my project stronger 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.250
 to protect your loved ones and the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.889
 world but they never get to overcome the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.079
 power level of goku and this we can 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.659
 see in the crossover they did come 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.920
 historic and dragon ball where he notes 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.920
 the gigantic power of goku 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.030
 vegueta makes his desmadrito together with 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 alone and zebra 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.900
 you could 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.830
 editor 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.180
 but they do not kill them that so merciful 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.180
 and a curious fact 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.700
 it's not because campa 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.920
 he forgot to play it 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.810
 and as in this point of view you are already 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.590
 cut the tail and also welcome a 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.250
 curious 22 of dragonball because it was 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.250
 forgot to draw it 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.590
 because the night 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.600
 we come to the program section of the 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.580
 where will I put pictures of you 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.720
 showing how fans are from 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.120
 Aragon vol 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.980
 this week the image is of my uncle 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.980
 they run this code with goku 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.190
 and comment what you would do if 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.380
 meet aira toriyama down or in the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.519
 social networks and remember to raise your 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.519
 arms to see your energy
