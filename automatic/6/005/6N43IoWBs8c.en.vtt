00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
spawners or anything like that the mobs
will<00:01:26.369> spawn<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.880> these<00:01:27.060> blocks<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> they're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
will spawn on these blocks and they're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
will spawn on these blocks and they're
pretty<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.290> difficult<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> take<00:01:29.610> care<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
pretty much difficult to take care of it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.640 
pretty much difficult to take care of it
because<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.659> hit<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> block

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
because they will hit you off the block

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.280 
because they will hit you off the block
especially<00:01:31.860> skeletons<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.140> see

especially skeletons so as you can see

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
especially skeletons so as you can see
here<00:01:34.439> though<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> some<00:01:35.159> pig<00:01:35.340> spawner

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
here though we do have some pig spawner
