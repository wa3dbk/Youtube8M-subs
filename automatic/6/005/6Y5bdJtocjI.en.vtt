00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 so hello today on repair 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.929
 samsung has 350 e 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 problem downed touch display module 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:23.490
 a session of bolts here first 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:28.019
 so here we disconnect the lid plume and so 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.930
 disassemble begin to leave so here in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.110
 but the end is not visible and quietly 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.719
 neatly neatly remove 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 as if the top cover to the back 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.930
 listening to my middle case 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.940
 act very carefully since 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 so I have a display so that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 do not damage the display and it is inadvertently not 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.980
 burst from at by such a way 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.629
 slowly moving forward 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.439
 you already take out the display and so when 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.390
 opening 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.750
 still pay attention to what it is 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.430
 except already selak which one clings 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 for the body station all 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.159
 and stuck then hold back and snap 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.770
 and glue so be careful then 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.310
 there is after disassembly let's say this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.150
 case that is, there is a fish named after them glue 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 and that's one place can be seen or not seen here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.360
 this is visible instead of a blow there is plastic 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.180
 carried out that is leveling that is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 plastic roll out in such a way that is 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.439
 from siz wine a new sensor we don't 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.380
 will rise now it is necessary to separate itself 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.869
 touch glass 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.869
 Knox display for this, too, warm up 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 that is, after 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.940
 usually pretty well warmed up 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.940
 take a piece of film 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.390
 solid and to begin to present in 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 butt until tip appears between 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.380
 We are promoting this with a sensor in Odessa 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.269
 way to release from glue 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.349
 that is, the process procedure is not very 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:33.340
 quickly but that is to say it requires 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:38.590
 some accuracy in not rushing here 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.100
 I recommend and so old 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 review removed 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.750
 I advise you to do very very neatly 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.320
 not in a hurry now take a new one 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.110
 senso and even though he is original and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.890
 ordered from the official service 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.840
 center 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.040
 but for better reasons just in case 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.040
 best to check 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.980
 So we check bear 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.800
 in this form 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.330
 with not fully assembling ie insert 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.300
 sensor display the display will then popollit 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.250
 such an expanded form is quite possible 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.250
 gives us the opportunity to check it 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.130
 now boot 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.650
 check the forces of flour 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.650
 all digits 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.880
 plots 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.880
 all work 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.630
 everything is working 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.430
 start assembly 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.220
 so before the sticker 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.610
 brushing innoch dust 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:37.500
 there are remnants of glue 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.500
 let's stay 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.530
 conscience and 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.380
 we whisk away all dust and glue 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.070
 for gluing well, let's say that the wave 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.370
 get there 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.790
 display exactly so that without sighting 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.230
 there have even build, without distortions 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.810
 that is, well, everything is simple here 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.880
 oracal film is perforated 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.620
 and film and removed separately that is 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.120
 we remove separate just in this place 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.700
 here and so we paste the display 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.410
 then remove the second part of the film and 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.410
 respectively, glue it already in the case 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.620
 here and so all rovnenko woven again 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.169
 spent swearing pulling and motes on 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.260
 Do not leave fingers on the display 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:36.360
 always everything is just a sensor plug 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.360
 what's in the display connector 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.889
 have inserted 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.790
 and fixed 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.980
 then glue 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:58.090
 then we start to collect in the opposite 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.090
 fine iron frame 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.120
 module with speaker 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.960
 before respectively collect and 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.750
 let's say here in these 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.910
 life of the upper part it is glued then 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.210
 there is need not forget to remove the protective 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.380
 the film is removed, it is like that for a corner 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:25.740
 we pull lightly and then from perforated 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.740
 now it is simply separated around the perimeter 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.320
 so here I am shooting 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:37.190
 again tasha we collect already as it is 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.920
 it is glued to all coincided 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.290
 Now and the bottom of the center 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.760
 button we look at the top 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:50.440
 that is, on the dynamics of the sleeve in principle 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.440
 all you need to throw a fee 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.710
 spend it twisting and checking 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.370
 after assembly 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.370
 check again 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.740
 best roulette 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.550
 everything works 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.219
 yourself for attention
