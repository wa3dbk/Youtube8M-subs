of detail in the shadow this one is for

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.080 
of detail in the shadow this one is for
the<00:01:43.119> air<00:01:43.420> conditioner<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:45.280> speed<00:01:45.640> light<00:01:45.850> is

set redirected the beam so that it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.670 
set redirected the beam so that it
looked<00:01:54.910> like<00:01:55.060> we're<00:01:55.330> getting<00:01:55.509> spill<00:01:56.170> from<00:01:56.470> our

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680

table lamp onto the floor this light is

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.260 
table lamp onto the floor this light is
coming<00:01:59.800> from<00:01:59.920> another<00:02:00.220> hidden<00:02:00.640> speed<00:02:01.060> light

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
coming from another hidden speed light

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.510 
coming from another hidden speed light
that<00:02:01.960> we<00:02:02.110> directed<00:02:02.440> against<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.950> wall<00:02:03.130> this

that we directed against the wall this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760
