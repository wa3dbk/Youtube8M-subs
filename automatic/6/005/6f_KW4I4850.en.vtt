00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and it's the same with the pine trees if

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.830 
and it's the same with the pine trees if
you<00:00:56.250> tip<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.610> back<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.480> hearing

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you tip them back now with your hearing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.780 
you tip them back now with your hearing
back<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.830> going<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.040> get<00:00:59.130> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.400> bud

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
back you're going to get a lot more bud

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.030 
back you're going to get a lot more bud
set<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.750> let<00:01:00.990> them<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.380> we're

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
set that if you just let them go we're

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.810 
set that if you just let them go we're
buds<00:01:02.340> mean<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:03.060> pushing<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.600> okay<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
buds mean we're pushing it okay this is

buds mean we're pushing it okay this is
June<00:01:05.820> eleventh<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.439> reason<00:01:07.830> we're<00:01:07.950> doing

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
June eleventh and the reason we're doing

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.040 
June eleventh and the reason we're doing
it<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.910> new<00:01:09.060> growth<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.690> fully

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
it now is the new growth is not fully

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.170 
it now is the new growth is not fully
set<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.520> trim<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> little

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
set and when we trim it back a little

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
set and when we trim it back a little
bit<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> new<00:01:12.750> bud<00:01:12.990> growth<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.530> occur<00:01:16.670> same<00:01:17.670> way

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
bit a new bud growth will occur same way

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.790 
bit a new bud growth will occur same way
on<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.060> tops<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> make<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
on your tops you want to make sure that

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.430 
on your tops you want to make sure that
when<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.040> cut<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.400> lateral<00:01:21.330> branches<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
when you cut these lateral branches that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840 
when you cut these lateral branches that
you<00:01:22.620> at<00:01:22.680> least<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.980> where<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.340> two<00:01:23.580> buds

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you at least see where one or two buds

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.520 
you at least see where one or two buds
are<00:01:24.030> formed<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.900> make<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> cut<00:01:25.380> they'll

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
are formed we make the cut they'll

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.260 
are formed we make the cut they'll
probably<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.460> buds<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
probably go to for more buds but just to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.950 
probably go to for more buds but just to
be<00:01:27.360> sure

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
be sure

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
be sure
just<00:01:28.680> look<00:01:28.830> for<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.010> little<00:01:29.250> round<00:01:29.850> spot<00:01:30.270> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just look for a little round spot in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.160 
just look for a little round spot in
there<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.720> can't<00:01:30.960> budge<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> cut<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
there I can't budge that and cut that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420 
there I can't budge that and cut that
back<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.800> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:35.280> about

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
back here we're going to take off about

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
back here we're going to take off about
half<00:01:35.850> otherwise<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.380> with

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
half otherwise it's going to end up with

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
half otherwise it's going to end up with
too<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:37.860> space<00:01:38.159> between<00:01:38.220> our<00:01:38.729> branches<00:01:39.180> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
too much space between our branches and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.240 
too much space between our branches and
in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> same<00:01:40.380> thing<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> pine<00:01:40.920> teas<00:01:41.130> we're

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
in the same thing in the pine teas we're

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
in the same thing in the pine teas we're
going<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.580> more<00:01:41.640> pipe<00:01:42.000> formation<00:01:42.510> on<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
going a lot more pipe formation on the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.570 
going a lot more pipe formation on the
top<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.710> buds<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.400> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
top and these buds here are going to
