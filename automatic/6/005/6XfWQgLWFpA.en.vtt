them something different um and my
advice<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.090> electives<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> try<00:01:58.140> something

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
advice for electives is try something

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
advice for electives is try something
you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.119> God<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.600> cat<00:02:00.899> just

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
