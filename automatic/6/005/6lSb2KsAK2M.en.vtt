but<00:02:11.600> um<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.290> figured<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.400> uh<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.180> was<00:02:14.480> going

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
but um I figured out that uh I was going

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350 
but um I figured out that uh I was going
through<00:02:14.750> all<00:02:14.990> my<00:02:15.020> videos<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.860> stuff<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.090> I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
through all my videos and stuff and I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.290 
through all my videos and stuff and I
found<00:02:18.200> out<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.590> for<00:02:19.430> some<00:02:19.610> reason<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.970> decided

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
found out it for some reason I decided

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.170 
found out it for some reason I decided
not<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.720> upload<00:02:21.080> my<00:02:21.290> best<00:02:22.280> video<00:02:22.610> ever<00:02:22.820> on<00:02:22.910> mah

not to upload my best video ever on mah

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.570 
not to upload my best video ever on mah
room<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.600> end<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.380> figured<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.370> going

game<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.050> don't<00:03:15.200> understand<00:03:15.640> hopefully<00:03:16.640> it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
game I don't understand hopefully it's

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.940

that<00:03:16.850> bad<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.360> black<00:03:17.810> ops<00:03:18.020> 2<00:03:18.290> while<00:03:18.500> infrared

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
that bad on black ops 2 while infrared

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.650 
that bad on black ops 2 while infrared
actually<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.550> what<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:19.850> will<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.090> on<00:03:20.210> black<00:03:20.450> ops

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
actually is what it will be on black ops

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.050 
actually is what it will be on black ops
but<00:03:21.440> hopefully<00:03:21.770> is<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.040> bad<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.400> blackout

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
but hopefully is that bad on blackout

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.220
