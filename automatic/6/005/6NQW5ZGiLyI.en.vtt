00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
scrolls are important is because they

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.910

confirm the Bible that we have there's
variants<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.160> basically<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.469> can

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
variants but basically it's you can

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
variants but basically it's you can
hardly<00:00:50.160> tell<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.579> difference<00:00:51.000> between<00:00:51.149> the
