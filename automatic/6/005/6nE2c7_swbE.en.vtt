was the map that I used it the most on I
almost<00:01:01.469> always<00:01:01.710> used<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:03.120> guy<00:01:03.420> has

almost always used it in this guy has

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.710 
almost always used it in this guy has
the<00:01:04.439> amazing<00:01:04.860> ability<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.970> four<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> my

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the amazing ability to take four of my

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
the amazing ability to take four of my
bullets<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.260> kill<00:01:07.290> him

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bullets to kill him

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.420 
bullets to kill him
but<00:01:08.670> yeah<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.100> sometimes<00:01:11.100> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
but yeah I don't know I sometimes have

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
but yeah I don't know I sometimes have
difficulty<00:01:11.820> aiming<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> ACOG<00:01:13.080> just

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
difficulty aiming with the ACOG just

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
difficulty aiming with the ACOG just
because<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> can't<00:01:14.630> study<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> aim

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
because you know you can't study the aim

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740 
because you know you can't study the aim
and<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:17.040> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> difficult<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.330> hit<00:01:18.600> them

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and it's kind of difficult to hit them

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.539 
and it's kind of difficult to hit them
with<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> red<00:01:19.170> try<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.040> strongly

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
with the red try or the one strongly

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.670 
with the red try or the one strongly
thing<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.500> what<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> end<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.040> doing<00:01:23.100> usually<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
thing but what I end up doing usually is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
thing but what I end up doing usually is
yeah<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.920> killed<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> usually<00:01:26.850> end<00:01:27.180> up

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
yeah I got killed what I usually end up

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.350 
yeah I got killed what I usually end up
doing<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.990> kind<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> unschooling<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.939> second

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
doing is kind of unschooling the second

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
doing is kind of unschooling the second
I<00:01:30.479> shoot<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> find<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.590> almost<00:01:31.950> makes<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I shoot and I find that almost makes it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
I shoot and I find that almost makes it
more<00:01:32.820> accurate<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.960> aim<00:01:34.170> near

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
more accurate like I kind of aim near

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.670 
more accurate like I kind of aim near
them<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:36.049> let<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> left

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
them and then I let go of the left

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.640 
them and then I let go of the left
trigger<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.909> unscoped<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> seems<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
trigger to unscoped and it seems like it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.929 
trigger to unscoped and it seems like it
makes<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.880> hit<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.540> Plus<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
makes them get hit more Plus and now I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
makes them get hit more Plus and now I
aim<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> lot<00:01:45.630> more<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:46.020> walking<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.369> lot

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
aim a lot more by walking which is a lot

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940 
aim a lot more by walking which is a lot
more<00:01:47.640> accurate<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.750> left<00:01:49.500> handed

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
more accurate for me because left handed

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.440 
more accurate for me because left handed
and<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.100> can't<00:01:50.399> aim<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> right<00:01:51.240> analog

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and I can't aim with the right analog

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.319 
and I can't aim with the right analog
stick<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.970> seems<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> work

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
stick so I don't know it seems to work

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.590 
stick so I don't know it seems to work
for<00:01:54.689> me<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:56.130> game<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.399> actually<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
for me this game I actually I got a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.139 
for me this game I actually I got a
ridiculous<00:01:58.229> amount<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> kills<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:02:00.030> not

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ridiculous amount of kills but I'm not

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.859 
ridiculous amount of kills but I'm not
all<00:02:00.329> plotting<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> entire<00:02:01.320> game<00:02:01.649> because

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
all plotting the entire game because

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.130 
all plotting the entire game because
after<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.049> my<00:02:04.320> third<00:02:04.649> death

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
after I think my third death

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.340 
after I think my third death
it's<00:02:06.560> spawn<00:02:06.830> trap<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.550> then<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.660> host<00:02:08.899> had

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's spawn trap and then the host had

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.650 
it's spawn trap and then the host had
like<00:02:09.649> problems<00:02:10.340> with<00:02:10.640> their<00:02:10.819> internet<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.510> we

be showing you guys the first like half
of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.400> game<00:02:16.610> with<00:02:17.450> me<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:17.900> ACOG<00:02:18.319> sniper

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
of the game with me and my ACOG sniper

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.490 
of the game with me and my ACOG sniper
and<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.819> love<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.480> sound<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:21.020> makes<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and I just love the sound it makes and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.280 
and I just love the sound it makes and
the<00:02:21.590> way<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.890> kills<00:02:22.130> feel<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:23.120> don't<00:02:23.840> know<00:02:23.930> it's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the way the kills feel I don't know it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.750 
the way the kills feel I don't know it's
just<00:02:24.350> really<00:02:24.560> rewarding<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> kill<00:02:25.580> with

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
just really rewarding to get a kill with

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.150 
just really rewarding to get a kill with
this<00:02:25.880> gun<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.240> because<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.230> don't<00:02:27.740> know<00:02:27.830> it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
this gun just because I don't know it's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640 
this gun just because I don't know it's
not<00:02:28.280> even<00:02:28.400> hard<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.440> way<00:02:30.530> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
not even hard really because the way it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.520 
not even hard really because the way it
works<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.730> ACOG<00:02:32.090> scope<00:02:32.239> adds<00:02:32.570> five<00:02:32.959> damage

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
works is the ACOG scope adds five damage

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.000 
works is the ACOG scope adds five damage
to<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.250> gun<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.660> guns<00:02:36.260> base<00:02:36.650> damage

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
to the gun so now the guns base damage

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.370 
to the gun so now the guns base damage
is<00:02:37.130> 75<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.390> that's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.600> one-hit<00:02:38.959> kill<00:02:39.200> with

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
is 75 so that's a one-hit kill with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.960 
is 75 so that's a one-hit kill with
stopping<00:02:39.590> power<00:02:39.860> no<00:02:40.100> matter<00:02:40.190> where<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.790> hit

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
stopping power no matter where you hit

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820 
stopping power no matter where you hit
them<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.290> shoot<00:02:42.470> them<00:02:42.620> in<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
them so like you can shoot them in the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.340 
them so like you can shoot them in the
toe<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.730> you'll<00:02:44.120> get<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.269> one-hit<00:02:44.570> kill<00:02:44.810> which

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
toe and you'll get a one-hit kill which

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.320 
toe and you'll get a one-hit kill which
is<00:02:45.530> great<00:02:45.800> because<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.160> pretty<00:02:46.670> much<00:02:46.760> equals

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
is great because it pretty much equals

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.380 
is great because it pretty much equals
no<00:02:47.660> hit<00:02:47.900> markers<00:02:48.260> whatsoever<00:02:49.030> which<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.180> good

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
no hit markers whatsoever which is good

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.090 
no hit markers whatsoever which is good
because<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.810> know<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.320> gun<00:02:51.470> has<00:02:51.680> sway

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
because you know you the gun has sway

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.610 
because you know you the gun has sway
and<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:53.540> doesn't<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> lot<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.110> zoom<00:02:54.410> so

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and it doesn't have a lot of zoom so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.750 
and it doesn't have a lot of zoom so
it's<00:02:54.739> kind<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.950> hard<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.220> hit<00:02:55.370> people<00:02:55.519> at<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it's kind of hard to hit people at a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's kind of hard to hit people at a
distance<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.360> you're<00:02:56.870> using<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.170> sniper

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
distance and you're using a sniper

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440 
distance and you're using a sniper
that's<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:58.040> know<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.519> guess<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.360> whole

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that's you know I guess the whole

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.750 
that's you know I guess the whole
concept<00:02:59.840> is<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.110> be<00:03:00.170> accurate<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:02.500> really

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
concept is to be accurate but really

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
concept is to be accurate but really
getting<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.880> hit<00:03:05.030> marker<00:03:05.330> with<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> sniper

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
getting a hit marker with the sniper

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.229 
getting a hit marker with the sniper
just<00:03:06.019> sucks<00:03:06.410> especially<00:03:07.040> like<00:03:07.519> if<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.060> shoot

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
just sucks especially like if you shoot

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.390 
just sucks especially like if you shoot
them<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.420> leg<00:03:08.720> or<00:03:09.350> whatever<00:03:09.590> because<00:03:10.040> you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
them the leg or whatever because you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.949 
them the leg or whatever because you
know<00:03:10.519> if<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.910> shoot<00:03:11.060> somebody<00:03:11.269> twice<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
know if you shoot somebody twice in the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.380 
know if you shoot somebody twice in the
leg<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.590> with<00:03:13.190> an<00:03:13.280> assault<00:03:13.549> rifle<00:03:13.640> it'll

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
leg with a with an assault rifle it'll

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.729 
leg with a with an assault rifle it'll
kill<00:03:14.600> them<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:14.900> twice<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.320> toe<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
kill them or twice in the toe and

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.699 
kill them or twice in the toe and
realistically<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:17.120> wouldn't<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.780> same<00:03:18.590> with

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
realistically it wouldn't and same with

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.360 
realistically it wouldn't and same with
the<00:03:18.799> sniper<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.700> think<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.090> fair

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the sniper so like I think it's fair

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.650 
the sniper so like I think it's fair
maybe<00:03:22.370> not<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.640> don't<00:03:22.880> know<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.060> really<00:03:23.360> don't

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
maybe not I don't know I really don't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.030 
maybe not I don't know I really don't
like<00:03:23.750> getting<00:03:23.900> quick<00:03:24.260> scoped<00:03:24.560> by<00:03:24.739> ACOG

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
like getting quick scoped by ACOG

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.130 
like getting quick scoped by ACOG
snipers<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.640> love<00:03:25.910> doing<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.360> it's<00:03:27.079> just

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
snipers but I love doing it it's just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.449 
snipers but I love doing it it's just
really<00:03:27.320> annoying<00:03:27.590> when<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.190> have<00:03:28.220> with

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
really annoying when you you have with

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.650 
really annoying when you you have with
assault<00:03:28.760> rifle<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.150> somebody<00:03:29.390> comes<00:03:29.570> up

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
assault rifle and somebody comes up

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.740 
assault rifle and somebody comes up
close<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.170> kills<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.620> with<00:03:30.739> their<00:03:30.890> sniper

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
close and kills you with their sniper

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.819 
close and kills you with their sniper
but<00:03:32.750> yeah<00:03:32.900> it's<00:03:33.049> really<00:03:33.230> easy<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.590> quickscope

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
but yeah it's really easy to quickscope

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.670 
but yeah it's really easy to quickscope
with<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.329> bullets<00:03:35.630> like<00:03:35.750> dead<00:03:36.049> accurate

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
with this the bullets like dead accurate

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.310 
with this the bullets like dead accurate
you<00:03:37.280> aim<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.120> almost<00:03:38.450> instantly<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.260> you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
you aim in almost instantly and you

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.229 
you aim in almost instantly and you
never<00:03:39.500> get<00:03:39.709> hit<00:03:39.890> markers<00:03:40.250> which<00:03:40.790> makes<00:03:41.030> this

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
never get hit markers which makes this

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.970 
never get hit markers which makes this
like<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.600> most<00:03:41.780> fun<00:03:42.079> quick<00:03:42.410> scoping<00:03:42.799> you'll

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
like the most fun quick scoping you'll

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.880 
like the most fun quick scoping you'll
ever<00:03:43.130> find<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:45.019> it's<00:03:45.590> almost<00:03:45.709> like

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
ever find it's like it's almost like

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.470 
ever find it's like it's almost like
playing<00:03:46.040> private<00:03:46.459> matches<00:03:46.850> where<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.360> have

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
playing private matches where you have

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.420 
playing private matches where you have
miniscule<00:03:48.019> health<00:03:48.200> except<00:03:48.590> for<00:03:48.769> it's<00:03:48.950> not<00:03:49.130> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
miniscule health except for it's not and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.509 
miniscule health except for it's not and
I<00:03:50.180> think<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.660> got<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.840> hitmarker<00:03:51.140> there<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:52.130> you

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
I think I got a hitmarker there but you

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.830 
I think I got a hitmarker there but you
will<00:03:52.700> get<00:03:52.880> hit<00:03:53.060> markers<00:03:53.360> if<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.600> shoot

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
will get hit markers if you shoot

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.539 
will get hit markers if you shoot
through<00:03:54.049> surfaces<00:03:54.620> like<00:03:54.829> walls<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.400> whatnot

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
through surfaces like walls and whatnot

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.340 
through surfaces like walls and whatnot
so<00:03:56.799> be<00:03:57.799> aware<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:59.239> yeah<00:03:59.540> just<00:04:00.110> running

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
so be aware of that so yeah just running

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.650 
so be aware of that so yeah just running
around<00:04:00.410> here<00:04:00.769> ACOG<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.670> kind<00:04:01.880> of<00:04:01.970> like<00:04:02.120> stay<00:04:02.630> in

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
around here ACOG I kind of like stay in

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.190 
around here ACOG I kind of like stay in
these<00:04:02.840> staircases<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.769> seems<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.250> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
these staircases it seems like the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.390 
these staircases it seems like the
distance<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.380> like<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.739> hallways<00:04:07.130> in<00:04:07.160> this

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
distance is like the hallways in this

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.340 
distance is like the hallways in this
building<00:04:07.820> are<00:04:08.359> like<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.660> perfect<00:04:09.140> distance

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
building are like the perfect distance

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.069 
building are like the perfect distance
to<00:04:09.769> be<00:04:09.859> using<00:04:10.190> an<00:04:10.340> ACOG<00:04:10.730> sniper<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.900> not

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
to be using an ACOG sniper like it's not

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.660 
to be using an ACOG sniper like it's not
too<00:04:12.320> far<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.859> really<00:04:13.220> have<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.400> work

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
too far that you really have to work

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.880 
too far that you really have to work
hard<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.660> know<00:04:14.720> accurately<00:04:15.440> line<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.800> up

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
hard to you know accurately line it up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.710 
hard to you know accurately line it up
because<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.459> sway<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.570> just

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
because of the sway so you can just

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.180 
because of the sway so you can just
fairly<00:04:18.380> easily

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
fairly easily

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.330 
fairly easily
amen<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.090> shoot<00:04:20.630> people<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:22.190> know<00:04:22.280> you

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
amen and shoot people and you know you

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.190 
amen and shoot people and you know you
can<00:04:22.550> it's<00:04:23.150> not<00:04:23.180> too<00:04:23.450> hard<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.870> keep<00:04:24.080> yourself

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
can it's not too hard to keep yourself

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.970 
can it's not too hard to keep yourself
at<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> distance<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.750> yeah<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.560> guy<00:04:27.800> I

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980

thing that was really annoying because

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.010

it pretty much takes like two hits no

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.600 
it pretty much takes like two hits no
matter<00:04:36.260> where<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.710> hit<00:04:36.890> them<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.220> kill<00:04:37.400> them

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
matter where you hit them to kill them

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.860 
matter where you hit them to kill them
but<00:04:38.300> anyways<00:04:38.690> yeah<00:04:39.170> I<00:04:39.800> think<00:04:40.460> yeah<00:04:40.970> nice<00:04:41.300> 20
