00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.870
 Good morning here is pure again today 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.650
 I would like meat salad like from 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.490
 make butcher 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.430
 a recipe that michael in terms of it into 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 we are always using this network 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.980
 our thermomix always prepares 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.680
 first comes the meat sausage no the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.810
 have ever been in 3 cm long pieces 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.810
 has previously cut the sausage acts 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:49.780
 we need the meat sausage first 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.510
 make a small first only three very short 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.840
 seconds then you have to see if you 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 The meat just needs to be a bit finer 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 the whole on level 5 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.979
 with the look in it's the size 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 here it is in order so you can 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.040
 see 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 the meat is finely cut the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.939
 we need to decant now 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.610
 what we mean now rider 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 Crush the rest through it 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.630
 we all need those here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.119
 together for the meatier country as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.900
 next we have ours 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.420
 preparing gherkins 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:04.140
 but I have in 3 10 meter pieces 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.729
 Cut and put in the left pot 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.640
 we once played the lid 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:21.900
 on it three seconds 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:26.510
 and this time only step 4 out and shows 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 sometimes you see groups are pieces 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:39.030
 Crushed with asparagus there is a 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:43.049
 get bit on the upside for now 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:50.010
 First our sauce for the month 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:54.290
 meat salad made for it would have to now 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.290
 first 50 groups of water into it 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.950
 next we want 200 grams 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.100
 fresh cheese also back to zero 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.100
 to press 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:04:10.760
 then we need salad mayonnaise the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:04:15.040
 family of the b 80 km and replaced it 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 another 50 km 15 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.310
 then our meatless again 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.310
 give 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.580
 close the lid on it again 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:05:00.260
 now we will mix it up and 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:02.240
 although ten seconds and that with the left 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.940
 Run because we just want to stir 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.420
 do not crush it anymore on the 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.420
 level four 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.060
 Now let's have a look 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.590
 the thing mixed that I time that 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.419
 just off and I think marks 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.349
 not need again simultaneously hear the 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.629
 meat salad looks great 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.340
 all one would now decant into 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:40.159
 a prepared shake 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.159
 the butcher caught buying 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:06:00.110
 the whole thing is out in this air 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.110
 shortest time made by yourself 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.840
 that's how the meat salad looks now 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.840
