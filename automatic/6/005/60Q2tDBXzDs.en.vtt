00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
going to install it take a quick second

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.140 
going to install it take a quick second
and<00:01:05.510> we'll<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.170> install<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.430> that's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
going into the bot into the BIOS there's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
going into the bot into the BIOS there's
a<00:01:16.290> couple<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.850> can

delete button and that should take us

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.160 
delete button and that should take us
directly<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.180> BIOS<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> has<00:02:07.140> done

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
directly to the BIOS which it has done

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
directly to the BIOS which it has done
and<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> start<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.390> left<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
right and fix everything in these two

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180 
right and fix everything in these two

we're going to the advanced feature so

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.110 
we're going to the advanced feature so
we<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.810> do<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.080> overclock<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.640> my<00:02:58.760> turbo

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
we can do this overclock and on my turbo

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.550 
we can do this overclock and on my turbo
rate<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.570> main<00:02:59.930> they're<00:03:00.080> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.290> do<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.470> I'm

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
rate the main they're going to do is I'm

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.320 
rate the main they're going to do is I'm
going<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.710> change<00:03:00.920> all<00:03:01.130> these<00:03:01.280> out<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.610> 45<00:03:01.970> and

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
going to change all these out to 45 and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.090 
going to change all these out to 45 and
the<00:03:02.750> reason<00:03:03.020> I'm<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.200> make<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.440> 45<00:03:03.770> is

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the reason I'm gonna make it 45 is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.050 
the reason I'm gonna make it 45 is
because<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.520> want<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.820> 4.5<00:03:06.940> Giga<00:03:07.940> are

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060

overclocked everything gets on this page
looks<00:03:12.350> pretty<00:03:13.220> straightforward<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.570> we

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
looks pretty straightforward and we

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.540 
looks pretty straightforward and we
pretty<00:03:14.930> up<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.350> up<00:03:15.500> we<00:03:16.010> go<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.280> advanced

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
pretty up and up we go to the advanced

everything<00:03:19.489> looks<00:03:19.520> good<00:03:19.850> there

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
everything looks good there

we're gonna go to the voltage CPU
voltage<00:03:22.700> we're<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.450> bring<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:24.280> 1.23

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
voltage we're going to bring to 1.23

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.760 
voltage we're going to bring to 1.23
because<00:03:26.330> I<00:03:26.450> know<00:03:26.510> that's<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.989> stable<00:03:27.230> voltage

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770

for<00:03:28.430> my<00:03:28.730> particular<00:03:29.500> overclock<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.190> we're

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
for my particular overclock then we're

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.710 
for my particular overclock then we're
going<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.489> go<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.670> DRM<00:03:32.150> we're<00:03:32.330> gonna<00:03:32.510> change

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
going to go to DRM we're gonna change

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.010 
going to go to DRM we're gonna change
that<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.080> one<00:03:33.230> point<00:03:33.470> five<00:03:33.709> five<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.840> got

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
that to one point five five so we got

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.930 
that to one point five five so we got
both<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.350> those<00:03:36.620> change<00:03:37.100> we<00:03:37.340> got<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.610> change

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
both of those change we got this change

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.430 
both of those change we got this change
I<00:03:38.120> just<00:03:38.300> like<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.480> always<00:03:38.600> go<00:03:38.870> back<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.230> take<00:03:39.380> a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
I just like to always go back and take a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.910 
I just like to always go back and take a
peek<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.920> make<00:03:40.100> sure<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.430> everything<00:03:40.910> is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
peek to make sure that everything is

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.920 
peek to make sure that everything is
performing<00:03:42.920> correctly

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.260 

and<00:03:48.930> I'm<00:03:49.080> just<00:03:49.260> bouncing<00:03:49.770> back<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.130> forth<00:03:50.400> so

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and I'm just bouncing back and forth so

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.880 
and I'm just bouncing back and forth so
everything<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.630> good<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:51.810> system<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.740> don't

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
everything is good here system we don't

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.780 
everything is good here system we don't
even<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.160> anything

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
even do anything

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.460 
even do anything
