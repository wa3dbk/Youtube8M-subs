00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
which is actually really bad in my
opinion<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.450> means<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.840> mix<00:01:40.020> traits<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
opinion it means you can mix traits of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
opinion it means you can mix traits of
survival<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.549> build<00:01:41.670> something<00:01:41.820> created

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
survival you can build something created

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.240 
survival you can build something created
then<00:01:42.540> below<00:01:42.689> oh<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> survival

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
then below oh just do this in survival

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
then below oh just do this in survival
which<00:01:44.369> share<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:45.090> guess<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
which share i guess you can or do that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.929

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
i would rather like it if they just

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.440 
i would rather like it if they just
remove<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.509> yeah<00:01:52.170> probably<00:01:52.710> won't<00:01:53.450> so
