00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
get to another class they've just put it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.470 
get to another class they've just put it
in<00:02:41.680> there<00:02:41.740> very<00:02:41.890> quick<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.090> also<00:02:43.300> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
in there very quick so this is also a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480 
in there very quick so this is also a
good<00:02:43.600> way<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.020> not<00:02:44.380> only<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.830> be<00:02:44.980> organized

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
good way just not only to be organized

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.460 
good way just not only to be organized
at<00:02:45.610> school<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.120> organizing<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:47.230> their

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
at school but just organizing all their

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.050 
at school but just organizing all their
papers<00:02:47.830> because<00:02:48.010> they<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:48.490> scads<00:02:48.850> and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
papers because they get right scads and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.390 
papers because they get right scads and
scads<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.450> papers<00:02:49.840> they<00:02:50.500> do<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.950> that's<00:02:51.070> part

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
scads of papers they do and that's part

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.100 
scads of papers they do and that's part
of<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.610> problem<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:52.959> these

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
of the problem this is that all these

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.410 
of the problem this is that all these
fly<00:02:53.620> away<00:02:53.830> papers<00:02:54.010> that's<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.790> big<00:02:54.970> problem<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
fly away papers that's a big problem and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.320 
fly away papers that's a big problem and
so<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:56.560> issue<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.950> what<00:02:57.580> do<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.820> do<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.150> all

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
so the issue is what do you do with all

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.600 
so the issue is what do you do with all
of<00:02:58.420> those<00:02:58.870> papers<00:02:59.230> once<00:02:59.800> they<00:02:59.980> start<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.370> pile

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
of those papers once they start to pile

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.480 
of those papers once they start to pile
up<00:03:00.790> again<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.540> answer<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.490> something

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
up again and the answer is something

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.160

just a really neat way of keeping track
of<00:04:45.880> things<00:04:46.240> if<00:04:46.540> they're<00:04:47.110> not<00:04:47.260> going<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.440> write

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
of things if they're not going to write

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.290 
of things if they're not going to write
it<00:04:47.680> down<00:04:47.800> but<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> do<00:04:48.490> want<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.790> show<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.030> an

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
it down but I do want to show you an

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.110 
it down but I do want to show you an
alternative<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.470> traditional

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
alternative to the traditional

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.600 
alternative to the traditional
assignment<00:04:52.120> notebook<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.610> the

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
assignment notebook and this is the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.750 
assignment notebook and this is the
homework<00:04:54.880> organizer<00:04:55.480> it's<00:04:55.900> from<00:04:56.430> h2o<00:04:57.430> and

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
it's just a little bit different than

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.830 
it's just a little bit different than
your<00:05:00.460> typical<00:05:00.730> homework<00:05:01.390> book<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:02.440> here
