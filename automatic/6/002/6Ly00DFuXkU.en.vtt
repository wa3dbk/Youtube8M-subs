of<00:01:26.790> sitting<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.210> under<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> steering

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of sitting there under the steering

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
of sitting there under the steering
wheel<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.860> might<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> check<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
wheel so you might want to check that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
wheel so you might want to check that
you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.360> off<00:01:30.540> white<00:01:30.780> connector<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> normal

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you know off white connector a normal

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
you know off white connector a normal
normal<00:01:31.650> connector<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.030> matches

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
normal connector for you know matches

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.460 
normal connector for you know matches
the<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> box

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the one in the box

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
the one in the box
so<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.280> plug<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> into<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:35.970> on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so here we go we plug it into the one on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
so here we go we plug it into the one on
the<00:01:36.150> box<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:38.150> there<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:40.470> let's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the box and there we go and then let's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.490 
the box and there we go and then let's
see<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> works<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:44.430> does<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.259> need<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
see if it works it does so you need to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
see if it works it does so you need to
do<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> extra<00:01:48.000> wiring

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
do that and have all this extra wiring

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
do that and have all this extra wiring
that<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that you don't want or you can do what I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
did just real quick hold on it's a paper

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.420 
did just real quick hold on it's a paper
clip<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.710> electrical<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.219> gonna

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
clip with just electrical we're gonna

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
clip with just electrical we're gonna
see<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.640> short<00:01:56.850> anything<00:01:57.000> else<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:58.070> what

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
see don't short anything else out what

see don't short anything else out what
you<00:01:59.159> do<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.439> connector<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:01.979> here

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
you do is see this connector right here

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.280 
you do is see this connector right here
I'll<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.299> pictures<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.689> us<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.079> put<00:02:04.200> up

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
I'll take pictures of us two and put up

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.310 
I'll take pictures of us two and put up
there<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.790> bottom<00:02:06.149> row<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.869> both<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
there the the bottom row for both of the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
there the the bottom row for both of the
ones<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.710> outside<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:08.520> both<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> lock

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
ones on the outside are both of the lock

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
ones on the outside are both of the lock
grounds<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> ground<00:02:11.069> those

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
grounds you want to ground those

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
grounds you want to ground those
together<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:12.030> ground<00:02:12.300> off<00:02:12.540> connect

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
together at ground off connect

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600 
together at ground off connect
those<00:02:13.480> together<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.740> they<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
those together so that they make the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.900 
those together so that they make the
same<00:02:15.820> connection<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:17.790> connection<00:02:18.790> does

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
same connection that the connection does

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.370 
same connection that the connection does
in<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.060> box<00:02:19.240> basically<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.020> he<00:02:20.140> let<00:02:20.260> me<00:02:20.320> do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
in the box basically so he let me do

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.650 
in the box basically so he let me do
that<00:02:20.470> real<00:02:20.620> quick<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:22.120> here<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.360> go<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.630> looks

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that real quick so here we go it looks

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.380 
that real quick so here we go it looks
like<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.300> know

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
like that just a little you know

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.220 
like that just a little you know
whatever<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.750> could<00:02:25.870> probably<00:02:25.990> make<00:02:26.140> this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
whatever you could probably make this

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.020 
whatever you could probably make this
actually<00:02:26.500> better<00:02:26.800> or<00:02:27.010> not<00:02:27.160> look<00:02:27.370> ghetto<00:02:27.640> but

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
actually better or not look ghetto but

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.810 
actually better or not look ghetto but
it<00:02:28.840> works<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.410> let's<00:02:30.130> go<00:02:30.250> over<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.700> see

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
it works and let's go over here and see

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.990 
it works and let's go over here and see
if<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.000> works<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:35.380> does<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.730> once<00:02:36.910> again

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
if it works and it does and once again

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.310 
if it works and it does and once again
we'll<00:02:37.240> take<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.570> just<00:02:37.840> one<00:02:37.990> side<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
we'll take this just one side of this

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.210 
we'll take this just one side of this
out<00:02:39.990> make<00:02:40.990> sure<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:42.570> wants<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.600> come<00:02:43.810> out

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
out make sure that wants to come out

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.710 
out make sure that wants to come out
there<00:02:45.220> we<00:02:45.310> go<00:02:45.400> see<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.730> loose<00:02:45.940> one<00:02:46.390> side<00:02:46.570> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
there we go see it's loose one side is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.020 
there we go see it's loose one side is
not<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:48.510> come<00:02:49.510> back<00:02:49.540> over<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
not in come back over here and it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.860 
not in come back over here and it
doesn't<00:02:52.300> work<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.970> more<00:02:55.120> time<00:02:55.390> plug<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.840> back

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
doesn't work one more time plug it back

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:07.070 
doesn't work one more time plug it back
in<00:03:01.350> let's<00:03:02.350> plugged<00:03:02.560> in

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
and you can see now what's the focus let

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.350 
and you can see now what's the focus let
the<00:03:11.700> locks<00:03:11.910> work<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.160> I'll<00:03:14.790> edit<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.210> video
