alright<00:01:33.830> this<00:01:33.950> looks<00:01:34.009> like<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.310> straight<00:01:34.640> track

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
alright this looks like a straight track

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.380 
alright this looks like a straight track
which<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.259> very<00:01:37.040> beneficial<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:38.000> lower<00:01:38.210> your

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
which is a very beneficial to lower your

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.719 
which is a very beneficial to lower your
horse<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.380> don't<00:01:39.530> have<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.799> moving<00:01:40.520> around

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
horse you don't have to moving around

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.880 
horse you don't have to moving around
here<00:01:41.149> just<00:01:41.509> positioning<00:01:42.020> you're<00:01:42.619> going<00:01:42.830> to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
here just positioning you're going to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.499 
here just positioning you're going to
the<00:01:42.979> straight<00:01:43.250> line<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.850> all<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.360> make

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the straight line so all you do is make

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.180 
the straight line so all you do is make
sure<00:01:44.539> you're<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.869> right<00:01:44.930> position<00:01:45.440> you're

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
sure you're in the right position you're

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.649 
sure you're in the right position you're
in<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> middle<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.090> I'm<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:47.600> of

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
in the middle so I'm going to kind of

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.710 
in the middle so I'm going to kind of
back<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.869> little<00:01:48.170> bit<00:01:49.240> might<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> little<00:01:50.570> bit

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
back a little bit might get a little bit

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.570 
back a little bit might get a little bit
rebellious<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.289> hope<00:01:51.470> not

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.640 

and<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.120> also<00:01:58.300> straight<00:01:58.870> police<00:01:59.230> occur

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
and this is also straight police occur

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:11.110 
and this is also straight police occur
along<00:01:59.890> so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.960 

all<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.920> we're<00:02:13.920> gonna<00:02:14.069> make<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.519> break<00:02:14.670> for

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
all right we're gonna make a break for

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.480 
all right we're gonna make a break for
it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.890 

she<00:02:20.820> moved<00:02:21.060> here<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.300> little<00:02:21.690> bit<00:02:21.840> too<00:02:22.730> quiet

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
she moved here a little bit too quiet

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:37.530 
she moved here a little bit too quiet
like<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.050> guess

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.789 

hopefully<00:02:38.290> she<00:02:38.469> made<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.769> money<00:02:39.150> no<00:02:40.150> she<00:02:40.209> did

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
hopefully she made the money no she did

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.670 
hopefully she made the money no she did
for<00:02:41.799> first<00:02:41.980> place<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.609> fifth<00:02:42.819> place<00:02:42.969> is<00:02:43.680> where

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
for first place to fifth place is where

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770 
for first place to fifth place is where
he<00:02:44.769> call<00:02:44.980> running<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.459> money<00:02:45.640> six<00:02:46.569> place
