00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that they've killed one of your

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
that they've killed one of your

teammates it's 25 and then that killed

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
teammates it's 25 and then that killed
was<00:00:35.670> 50<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.840> kills<00:00:37.410> should<00:00:37.950> be

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
was 50 so I think the kills should be

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
was 50 so I think the kills should be
like<00:00:38.280> bumped<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
like bumped up a little bit more but

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
like bumped up a little bit more but
that's<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.140> personal<00:00:40.530> opinion<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that's just my personal opinion this

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.520 
that's just my personal opinion this
gameplay<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.760> absolutely<00:00:42.510> insane<00:00:42.989> guys<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.410> was

what I recommend doing playing it a bit
slow<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.790> once<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.210> swarm<00:02:33.450> then

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
slow and then once you get to swarm then

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
slow and then once you get to swarm then
I<00:02:33.990> go<00:02:34.170> rush<00:02:34.380> happy<00:02:34.710> that's<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.580> tend<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.910> do

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
I go rush happy that's what I tend to do

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580
