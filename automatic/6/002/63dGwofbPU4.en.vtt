00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 your friends that was let's play poker 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.490
 the third round and a hell of a lot 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.779
 fun i must say it was really a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.540
 exciting thing and we have of course 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 also a bit for a few 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.019
 Disturbance worried or gong 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'm not sure we are 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.780
 should bring in a bit of chaos 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 Unfortunately, it has to do with the plans 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.260
 the making of it does not work that way 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.140
 Unfortunately we did not have that before 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 but between those and and in ours 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 florian silver rice 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 although the debitor has done his job 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.019
 he was always on top of him when he was 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 when he did that nobody came 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.019
 it was not until the first time the sound came 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.820
 bad he too one too bad 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 was switched to turn too slowly 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.550
 just say there when the blasters not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.809
 All in all , I should be shooting today 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.460
 all day but otherwise that the match 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.559
 in itself was but you have to say 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 the beginning was very exciting then in the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.890
 Mittelfeld it was quite sovereign right 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.270
 have calmed down and so and at the end yet 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 times properly dressed 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 Honestly that was one of the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 most exciting poker game i have seen here 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.090
 because otherwise I do not see them 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.260
 very few poker players except maybe 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.329
 my las vegas once over the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.500
 shoulder looked or so but that was s 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.910
 we are not poker ourselves 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.339
 experts, but we still have fun 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 what was not in this event 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 the main reason was that the participants 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 but we were really sympathetic and we were real 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.970
 had fun with all the people 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.830
 and I think that's what matters 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 and that would have been without fun and how 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.090
 Charity is also a good thing where 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 we also took our part 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.420
 especially because we thought that was a cool one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 thing to donate to the ark and the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 we support you very much and many 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.640
 thanks again to the many participants 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.619
 thanks again to the others 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 moderators also to you it was a very 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.780
 cheerful evening I think that was not 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.280
 the last one 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 it was I had to moderate times 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.939
 thank you right away forest I have that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.170
 sometimes just luckily chose not 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.210
 displayed during the broadcast or 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 Something a shit built so stop 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 shut up now and I hope we 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.250
 See you at the next event again 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 will be held in january beforehand 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.890
 however, it is still the end of november last one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.630
 standing 2 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 because it will not be back if you put it on everyone 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.840
 If we see and what we have before 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 but again the turn in January will be 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 really cool promised that poker 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 event in january will not be really cool 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.299
 is not going to be natural, of course 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 also last one standing 2 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 I hope breathtaking spectacle 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.469
 at least with a relatively low note 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.909
 chaos winner, of course, I'm pure 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.320
 I do not want to splurge now but I know 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.459
 honestly not what event 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.780
 horny is the should now no advertising 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.400
 that we are not anyhow now 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 be immediately 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 but that you really mean for 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.849
 both things are special things 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.860
 planned that are completely unbelievable and 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.019
 I am very excited as the next 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.760
 Things should look like coming from now 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.290
 but first enough we talked and we talked 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.739

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.769
 just really strong and we will 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.599

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.459
