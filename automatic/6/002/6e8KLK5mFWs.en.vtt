00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 the steps you must follow to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.850
 be able to activate the expansion pack 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.440
 it will be tough leaf that cold data then 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 is a plugin that allows us to record 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.600
 cv is fantastic games loops cuts 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.760
 edits but without damaging the file 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.120
 original it is necessary to clarify that since 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.470
 that data 174 we can no longer enjoy in 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.950

 then we go where it says activations is 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.640
 It is also necessary to clarify that we must 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.649
 have a ceratto account activated if 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.570
