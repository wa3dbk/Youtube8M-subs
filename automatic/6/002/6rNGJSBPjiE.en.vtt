and<00:00:37.329> that's<00:00:37.809> what<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.050> this<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.380> piece<00:00:38.620> of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
and that's what that this is a piece of

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.130 
and that's what that this is a piece of
oak<00:00:39.040> which<00:00:39.850> Senate<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:40.270> put<00:00:40.510> in<00:00:40.630> which<00:00:40.780> is<00:00:40.960> the

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
oak which Senate I put in which is the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.650 
oak which Senate I put in which is the
actual<00:00:41.469> trigger<00:00:42.070> guard<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.850> real<00:00:43.390> trigger

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
actual trigger guard the real trigger

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.869 
actual trigger guard the real trigger
because<00:00:44.440> if<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.800> put<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.100> linkage<00:00:45.579> here

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
because if you put this linkage here

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.520 
because if you put this linkage here
which<00:00:46.780> links<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.890> forward<00:00:48.699> mounted<00:00:49.530> trigger

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
which links the forward mounted trigger

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.349 
which links the forward mounted trigger
to<00:00:50.769> actually<00:00:51.010> push<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.519> release<00:00:51.670> trigger<00:00:52.179> at

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
to actually push the release trigger at

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.040 
to actually push the release trigger at
Luria<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.699> then<00:00:54.969> I've<00:00:55.239> just<00:00:55.300> got<00:00:55.629> this<00:00:55.719> little

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
Luria and then I've just got this little

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.950 
Luria and then I've just got this little
section<00:00:56.559> of<00:00:56.829> wood<00:00:57.010> here<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.659> actually

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
section of wood here which is actually

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.040 
section of wood here which is actually
what<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.109> cut<00:00:59.409> off<00:00:59.760> from<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.909> muzzle<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.390> you

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
what I cut off from the muzzle and you

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.250 
what I cut off from the muzzle and you
can<00:01:02.230> see<00:01:02.440> it's<00:01:02.620> quite<00:01:02.890> complicated<00:01:04.260> laminate

can see it's quite complicated laminate

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.040 
can see it's quite complicated laminate
design<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.800> went<00:01:05.920> into<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.870> it<00:01:07.870> looks

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
design that went into it and it looks

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.410 
design that went into it and it looks
quite<00:01:08.290> nice<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:09.130> real<00:01:09.310> life<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.730> can<00:01:09.909> see<00:01:10.180> a

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
quite nice in in real life you can see a

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.880 
quite nice in in real life you can see a
lot<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.530> laminate<00:01:12.130> showing<00:01:12.550> through<00:01:13.890> and

lot of a laminate showing through and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.190 
lot of a laminate showing through and
they<00:01:15.070> taper<00:01:15.340> down<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:16.570> quite<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.780> nice<00:01:16.930> it's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200

got their enclosed track a high quality

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.220 
got their enclosed track a high quality
trigger<00:01:21.070> unit<00:01:21.660> overall<00:01:22.660> I<00:01:22.690> think<00:01:22.870> it's<00:01:23.050> quite

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
trigger unit overall I think it's quite

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:51.149 
trigger unit overall I think it's quite
nice<00:01:24.900> leather<00:01:25.900> look<00:01:26.170> down<00:01:26.410> it<00:01:27.300> there<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:28.420> go
