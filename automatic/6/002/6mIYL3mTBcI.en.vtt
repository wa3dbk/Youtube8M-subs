00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
into a death kit although I won't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
recommend anyone to change those values

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.349 
recommend anyone to change those values
because<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.640> console<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
because this can put your console into a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
because this can put your console into a
boot<00:00:30.539> loop<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> break<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> see

program<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:39.479> found<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> link<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
program and I also found a link to the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
program and I also found a link to the
signup<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.920> apply<00:01:41.400> page<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> develop<00:01:42.479> IDE

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
signup or apply page for a develop IDE

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
signup or apply page for a develop IDE
the<00:01:43.079> link<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.409> also<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> description<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the link is also in the description and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
the link is also in the description and
there<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> says<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> full

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there it says that you can get full

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.010 
there it says that you can get full
access<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.520> tools<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> technology<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
access to tools and technology to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.620 
access to tools and technology to
develop<00:01:49.829> apps<00:01:50.040> games<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.299> Kinect

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
develop apps games of things for Kinect

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
develop apps games of things for Kinect
so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:52.979> awesome<00:01:53.100> because

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so I think it's pretty awesome because

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.149 
so I think it's pretty awesome because
with<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.329> every<00:01:54.780> console<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> dev<00:01:55.920> kit

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
with this every console can be a dev kit

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
with this every console can be a dev kit
for<00:01:56.340> new<00:01:56.460> indie<00:01:56.729> games<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.600> video

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
for new indie games and this video

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
for new indie games and this video
should<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> warning<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.100> people<00:01:59.310> who

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
should also be a warning for people who

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
should also be a warning for people who
already<00:01:59.759> did<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.229> mean

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
already did it and with that I mean

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
already did it and with that I mean
don't<00:02:01.950> change<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.759> sandbox<00:02:03.479> ID<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
don't change your sandbox ID I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.469 
don't change your sandbox ID I
think<00:02:04.409> every<00:02:04.770> deaf<00:02:04.979> gets<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.430> title<00:02:05.790> ID<00:02:06.149> which

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
think every deaf gets a title ID which

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.930 
think every deaf gets a title ID which
he<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.990> enter<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.670> set

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
he has to enter here and if you just set

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.330 
he has to enter here and if you just set
this<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.390> any<00:02:09.629> ID<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.410> free<00:02:10.739> zone<00:02:11.039> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
this to any ID like free zone that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790 
this to any ID like free zone that
reboot<00:02:11.790> which<00:02:12.360> some<00:02:12.690> people<00:02:12.840> say<00:02:13.230> under

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
reboot which some people say under

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430 
reboot which some people say under
