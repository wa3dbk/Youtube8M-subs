00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
lot of really really high heat last few
weeks<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> those<00:00:22.350> lower<00:00:22.680> leaves<00:00:22.949> been

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
weeks so some of those lower leaves been

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.910 
weeks so some of those lower leaves been
drying<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.119> burning<00:00:24.300> off<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.800> get

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
drying up and burning off but as you get

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040 
drying up and burning off but as you get
up<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.369> where<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> hops<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:27.119> they're<00:00:27.869> doing

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
up to where the hops are they're doing

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
up to where the hops are they're doing
pretty<00:00:28.140> good<00:00:28.439> i've<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.359> cascades

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
pretty good i've got a lot of cascades

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
pretty good i've got a lot of cascades
these<00:00:30.660> first<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> left<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> cascades

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
these first two and the left it cascades

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.479 
these first two and the left it cascades
and<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.300> some<00:00:33.300> centennial's<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and then some centennial's here on the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
and then some centennial's here on the
right<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.000> i<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.719> decided<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> stop

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
right and i just decided to stop

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.549 
right and i just decided to stop
trimming<00:00:37.890> back<00:00:38.239> these<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> bottom<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
trimming back these at the bottom I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.000 
trimming back these at the bottom I
don't<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:42.230> couple<00:00:43.230> four<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:43.829> five<00:00:43.980> weeks

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
don't know a couple four or five weeks

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.360 
don't know a couple four or five weeks
ago<00:00:44.719> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.320> guess<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.649> glad<00:00:46.860> i<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
ago and I guess I'm glad i did on that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
ago and I guess I'm glad i did on that
the<00:00:47.789> Centennial<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.809> have

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the Centennial as you could see we have

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.770 
the Centennial as you could see we have
some<00:00:49.170> hops<00:00:50.989> right<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.230> coming<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.780> as

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
some hops right there coming in and as

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.830 
some hops right there coming in and as
we<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:55.800> tons<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.719> coming<00:00:57.719> off

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
we go up there's tons more coming off

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.870 
we go up there's tons more coming off
open<00:00:58.199> than<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> Cascades

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.870 

so<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:04.170> appears<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:05.160> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
so it appears we're going to get a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it appears we're going to get a
pretty<00:01:06.360> decent<00:01:06.480> crop<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.050> our<00:01:07.140> first<00:01:07.350> year

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
pretty decent crop for our first year

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
pretty decent crop for our first year
that's<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.610> about<00:01:09.030> 15<00:01:09.660> feet<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.500> air

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's going about 15 feet up in the air

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.730 
that's going about 15 feet up in the air
there<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:12.020> I'm<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.560> first

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there so I'm pretty good for our first

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
there so I'm pretty good for our first
year<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.190> happy<00:01:14.550> and<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.380> root

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
year really happy and you know the root

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.810 
year really happy and you know the root
system<00:01:16.710> should<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.160> taken<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.520> well<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
system should have taken pretty well to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
system should have taken pretty well to
that<00:01:17.940> container<00:01:18.840> next<00:01:19.080> year<00:01:19.260> we<00:01:19.470> should<00:01:19.560> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that container next year we should do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.970 
that container next year we should do
even<00:01:20.070> better<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.990> really<00:01:21.990> excited<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:22.650> if
