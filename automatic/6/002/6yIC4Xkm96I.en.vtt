00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
larger and larger games are looking

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
larger and larger games are looking
better<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.450> even<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.840> games<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
better and then not even just games but

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
better and then not even just games but
movies<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> our<00:02:02.520> digital<00:02:03.060> lives<00:02:03.270> nowadays

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
movies and our digital lives nowadays

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.459 
movies and our digital lives nowadays
require<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.950> much<00:02:05.189> bandwidth<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.750> data<00:02:07.079> caps

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
require so much bandwidth that data caps

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.699 
require so much bandwidth that data caps
that<00:02:08.039> are<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.849> 250<00:02:09.569> gigs<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:09.989> example<00:02:10.440> are

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
that are at 250 gigs for example are

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.920 
that are at 250 gigs for example are
just<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.280> too<00:02:11.489> low<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.480> problem

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
just a bit too low so this is a problem

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.209 
just a bit too low so this is a problem
that<00:02:13.049> hopefully<00:02:13.439> gets<00:02:13.620> resolved<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.189> the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
that hopefully gets resolved in the

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.130 
that hopefully gets resolved in the
future<00:02:14.670> fight<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.299> good<00:02:15.329> fight<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> try<00:02:16.079> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
future fight the good fight and try to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
future fight the good fight and try to
get<00:02:16.290> those<00:02:16.469> data<00:02:16.829> caps<00:02:17.159> raised<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.760> guess

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
get those data caps raised I guess

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.080 
get those data caps raised I guess
because<00:02:18.480> game<00:02:19.230> file<00:02:19.650> sizes<00:02:20.129> are<00:02:20.489> getting<00:02:20.760> huge

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
because game file sizes are getting huge

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.490 
because game file sizes are getting huge
I<00:02:21.390> don't<00:02:21.599> think<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.840> comes<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.140> much<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.439> a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
I don't think it comes as much of a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
I don't think it comes as much of a
surprise<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.859> i<00:02:23.129> am<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.370> blizzard<00:02:23.730> fanboy<00:02:24.150> so
