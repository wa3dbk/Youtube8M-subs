00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
but yeah another boundary here it's so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.310 
but yeah another boundary here it's so
cool<00:03:17.790> how<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.209> still<00:03:18.600> goes<00:03:18.780> past<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
cool how it like still goes past the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.890 
cool how it like still goes past the
boundaries<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.770> little<00:03:19.980> bit

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
boundaries a little bit

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.420 
boundaries a little bit
very<00:03:21.900> very<00:03:22.020> cool<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.920> probably<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> best

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
very very cool this is probably the best

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.410 
very very cool this is probably the best
port<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> most<00:03:24.150> accurate<00:03:24.390> port<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:27.239> most

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
port the most accurate port and the most

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.050 
port the most accurate port and the most
I<00:03:27.780> guess<00:03:27.930> detailed<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> finished<00:03:29.550> port<00:03:29.820> most

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
I guess detailed and finished port most

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.290 
I guess detailed and finished port most
ports<00:03:30.480> wouldn't<00:03:31.350> have<00:03:31.709> fences<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:33.150> anything

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
ports wouldn't have fences or anything

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.150 
ports wouldn't have fences or anything
and<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.110> leave<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.380> as<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.980> white

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and just like leave it as with the white

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.860 
and just like leave it as with the white
wool<00:03:35.400> but<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:35.760> really<00:03:36.090> very<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.510> very

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
wool but it's really very and very

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.350 
wool but it's really very and very
accurate<00:03:37.430> good<00:03:38.430> port<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.000> want<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> find

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
accurate good port I do you want to find

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880
