00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.870 
going to do for Lent well it's important
to<00:02:06.280> know<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.689> Lenten<00:02:07.689> practices<00:02:08.410> are<00:02:08.680> really

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
to know that Lenten practices are really

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.520 
to know that Lenten practices are really
quite<00:02:09.880> different<00:02:10.149> than<00:02:10.660> New<00:02:11.350> Year's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
quite different than New Year's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.340 
quite different than New Year's
resolutions<00:02:12.250> which<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:13.360> course<00:02:13.420> try<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.990> focus

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
resolutions which of course try to focus

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.450 
resolutions which of course try to focus
on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
on

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.670 
on
self-improvement<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> length<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.470> not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
self-improvement and length is not

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
self-improvement and length is not
really<00:02:18.070> about<00:02:18.210> self-improvement

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
really about self-improvement

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.650 
really about self-improvement
it's<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:20.590> about<00:02:20.830> what<00:02:21.220> we're<00:02:21.940> doing<00:02:22.330> at<00:02:22.480> all

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
it's not about what we're doing at all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.650 
it's not about what we're doing at all
it's<00:02:22.990> about<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.860> God<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.160> doing<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:25.090> what

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
it's about what God is doing and what

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.970 
it's about what God is doing and what
God<00:02:26.070> wants<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.130> do<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.760> our<00:02:28.120> lives<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.770> in

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
God wants to do in our lives and so in

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.120 
God wants to do in our lives and so in
fact<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.700> question<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:35.590> am<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.800> going<00:02:35.980> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
fact the question of what am I going to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.670 
fact the question of what am I going to
do<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.310> lens<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.150> really<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.990> wrong<00:02:38.140> question

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
do for lens is really the wrong question

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.090 
do for lens is really the wrong question
to<00:02:38.830> ask<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.780> their<00:02:40.930> book<00:02:41.200> praying

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
