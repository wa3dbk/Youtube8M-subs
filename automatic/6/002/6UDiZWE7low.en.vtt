were giving out any update details so a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.520

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
lot of people were mad but anyways it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.050 
lot of people were mad but anyways it
was<00:04:07.620> still<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> really<00:04:08.130> fun<00:04:08.340> time<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
was still a really fun time I think the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.000 
was still a really fun time I think the
people<00:04:09.180> who<00:04:09.330> came<00:04:09.570> really<00:04:09.780> enjoyed<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.410> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
people who came really enjoyed it and I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.979 
people who came really enjoyed it and I
guess<00:04:11.280> here<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> breakdown<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.720> when<00:04:12.870> we

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
guess here is the breakdown so when we

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.330 
guess here is the breakdown so when we
got<00:04:13.140> there<00:04:13.350> we<00:04:13.500> sort<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.769> just<00:04:13.920> hung<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.190> for

and<00:04:27.780> then<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.230> yeah<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:28.890> started<00:04:29.160> at

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and then I think yeah it started at

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.100 
and then I think yeah it started at
three<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.820> think<00:04:30.030> at<00:04:30.120> 4:30<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.840> wouldn't

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
three and I think at 4:30 we wouldn't

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.740 
three and I think at 4:30 we wouldn't
live<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:32.370> first<00:04:32.760> thing<00:04:33.030> we<00:04:33.210> did<00:04:33.450> what<00:04:33.630> we

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
other than the QA we did some base

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.930 
other than the QA we did some base
reviews<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.220> people<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.730> sort<00:05:17.880> of

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
reviews for people it was sort of

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.280 
reviews for people it was sort of
awkward<00:05:18.300> because<00:05:18.480> it<00:05:18.690> was<00:05:18.810> hard<00:05:18.990> for<00:05:19.170> people

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
awkward because it was hard for people

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.990 
awkward because it was hard for people
to<00:05:19.470> listen<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.190> what<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> people<00:05:20.670> were<00:05:20.760> saying

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
to listen to what the people were saying

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000 
to listen to what the people were saying
about<00:05:21.210> their<00:05:21.360> base<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:22.290> shortly<00:05:22.590> after<00:05:22.680> that

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
about their base so shortly after that

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.410 
about their base so shortly after that
we<00:05:23.130> did<00:05:23.250> an<00:05:23.370> attack<00:05:23.670> contest<00:05:24.180> where<00:05:24.390> people

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
we did an attack contest where people

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.480 
we did an attack contest where people
would<00:05:24.810> attack<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.380> every<00:05:25.890> time<00:05:26.040> someone<00:05:26.370> did

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
would attack and every time someone did

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.920 
would attack and every time someone did
an<00:05:26.610> attack<00:05:26.850> on<00:05:27.060> stage<00:05:27.270> they'd<00:05:27.540> get<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.690> hundred

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
an attack on stage they'd get a hundred

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.930 
an attack on stage they'd get a hundred
dollar<00:05:28.170> gift<00:05:28.380> card<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.800> then<00:05:29.370> they<00:05:29.520> finally

this kid I think he was like nine years
old<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.050> he<00:05:37.440> was<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> last<00:05:37.860> person<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.220> attack

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
barbarian Archer composition and he got

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.930 
barbarian Archer composition and he got
three<00:05:42.870> stars<00:05:43.050> against<00:05:43.440> like<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.620> townhall<00:05:43.950> 7<00:05:44.310> so

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
three stars against like a townhall 7 so

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.280
