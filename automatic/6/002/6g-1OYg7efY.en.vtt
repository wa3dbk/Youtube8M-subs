00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
kind of amazing normally on this guitar

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
kind of amazing normally on this guitar
I<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> tune<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> guitar

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
I would have to tune the guitar

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
I would have to tune the guitar
specifically<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> position<00:01:23.030> having

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
specifically for this position having

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.770 
specifically for this position having
nothing<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.659> intonation<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> know

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
nothing to do with intonation you know

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780 
nothing to do with intonation you know
even<00:01:27.780> even<00:01:28.220> setting<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> guitar<00:01:29.579> up

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
even even setting the guitar up

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390 
even even setting the guitar up
perfectly<00:01:30.530> when<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
perfectly when you get up here and you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.390 
perfectly when you get up here and you
tend<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.049> bend<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.500> string<00:01:34.799> slightly<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
tend to bend the string slightly and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
tend to bend the string slightly and
make<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> sharp<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> evertune<00:01:37.530> system

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
make it sharp with the evertune system

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.880 
make it sharp with the evertune system
it<00:01:38.159> makes<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.720> nearly<00:01:39.720> impossible<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it makes it nearly impossible to do that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.179 
it makes it nearly impossible to do that
in<00:01:41.070> fact<00:01:41.280> quite<00:01:41.759> impossible<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> my<00:01:43.920> bad

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in fact quite impossible so my bad

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.480 
in fact quite impossible so my bad
technique<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.090> compensated<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
technique is compensated for by this

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
technique is compensated for by this
incredible<00:01:47.490> bridge<00:01:48.270> system<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.780> has

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
incredible bridge system which has

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
incredible bridge system which has
Springs<00:01:49.380> inside<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.670> constantly

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
Springs inside that are constantly

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170 
Springs inside that are constantly
adjusting<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.470> string<00:01:52.770> tension<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
adjusting the string tension to make it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.480 
adjusting the string tension to make it
play<00:01:54.329> perfectly<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:54.960> tune<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.680> save<00:01:58.950> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
play perfectly in tune this will save I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.600 
play perfectly in tune this will save I
would<00:02:00.479> estimate<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.259> don't<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.340> somewhere

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
would estimate I don't know somewhere

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.550 
would estimate I don't know somewhere
between<00:02:02.670> 30<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> 40<00:02:03.630> percent<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
recording studio when takes get thrown

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
recording studio when takes get thrown
out<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:08.399> they're<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> tune<00:02:09.030> even<00:02:09.360> if

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
out because they're out of tune even if

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.530 
out because they're out of tune even if
the<00:02:09.720> performance<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.379> really<00:02:10.500> good<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the performance was really good and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
the performance was really good and
particularly<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.870> someone<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.260> me<00:02:13.470> who

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
particularly for someone like me who

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
particularly for someone like me who
is<00:02:14.010> often<00:02:14.640> asked<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.720> layer<00:02:16.020> different<00:02:16.380> layers

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
is often asked to layer different layers

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.550 
is often asked to layer different layers
of<00:02:16.800> guitars<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.660> add<00:02:18.930> more<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.470> more

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of guitars and as you add more and more

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.880 
of guitars and as you add more and more
layers<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.950> guitar<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.780> tuning<00:02:22.170> gets

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
layers of guitar the the the tuning gets

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.040 
layers of guitar the the the tuning gets
worse<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.489> worse<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.690> hear<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
worse and worse you kind of hear the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.470 
worse and worse you kind of hear the
spread<00:02:25.410> starts<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> sound<00:02:26.430> very<00:02:26.580> chorus<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
spread starts to sound very chorus and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.820 
spread starts to sound very chorus and
especially<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.200> you're<00:02:28.319> playing<00:02:28.500> against

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
especially when you're playing against

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.330

sound<00:02:38.010> sour<00:02:38.310> real<00:02:38.730> fast<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.340> me<00:02:41.340> being<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.640> fan

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
sound sour real fast and me being a fan

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.280 
sound sour real fast and me being a fan
of<00:02:41.970> old<00:02:42.150> guitars<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.720> pretty<00:02:42.870> much<00:02:43.019> playing

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
of old guitars and pretty much playing

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.830 
of old guitars and pretty much playing
old<00:02:43.560> guitars<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.880> system<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.450> kind<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
old guitars this system is kind of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080 
old guitars this system is kind of
revolutionary<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.680> yeah<00:02:47.130> yesterday<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.850> was

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
revolutionary for yeah yesterday I was

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.960 
revolutionary for yeah yesterday I was
on<00:02:48.209> Jay<00:02:48.630> Leno<00:02:48.660> Show<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:50.100> cold<00:02:50.459> studio

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
on Jay Leno Show in a very cold studio

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.300 
on Jay Leno Show in a very cold studio
which<00:02:51.209> typically<00:02:51.630> will<00:02:52.380> change<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> tuning

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
which typically will change the tuning

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.690 
which typically will change the tuning
of<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.549> guitar<00:02:53.819> radically<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:55.580> didn't<00:02:56.580> have

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
of your guitar radically I didn't have

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.340 
of your guitar radically I didn't have
any<00:02:56.850> problems<00:02:57.330> playing<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> TV<00:02:58.140> show<00:02:58.319> I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
didn't have to tune the guitar at all

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.440 
didn't have to tune the guitar at all
and<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:01.440> took<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.890> home<00:03:01.920> since<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.330> been

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and I took it home since then it's been

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.660 
and I took it home since then it's been
in<00:03:03.569> my<00:03:03.660> car<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.350> out<00:03:04.470> hot<00:03:05.010> cold<00:03:05.400> hot<00:03:05.549> cold

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.190

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
and 335 as you may know has a wooden

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.670 
and 335 as you may know has a wooden
block<00:03:17.380> inside<00:03:17.980> which<00:03:18.370> gives<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.330> nice

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
block inside which gives it a nice

block inside which gives it a nice
weight<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.980> feel<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.850> there<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.630> some

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
weight and feel and there is some

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.720 
weight and feel and there is some
routing<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> guitar<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.160> takes<00:03:24.490> place

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
routing of the guitar that takes place

when<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.480> bridge<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.900> installed<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.530> was<00:03:26.710> very

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
when this bridge is installed I was very

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.930 
when this bridge is installed I was very
scared<00:03:28.300> about<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:29.220> changing<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.250> tone<00:03:30.610> and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
scared about it changing the tone and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.480 
scared about it changing the tone and
the<00:03:31.060> feel<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.660> weight<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.320> guitar<00:03:32.680> as

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
the feel and the weight of the guitar as

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.810 
the feel and the weight of the guitar as
you<00:03:34.270> can<00:03:34.420> see<00:03:34.600> on<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.840> back<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:36.100> way<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.280> you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you can see on the back the way that you

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.030 
you can see on the back the way that you
now<00:03:37.060> string<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.720> guitar<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.350> straight<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
now string the guitar is straight to the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.560 
now string the guitar is straight to the
back<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.490> guitar<00:03:39.610> like<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.150> would<00:03:40.300> on<00:03:40.330> an

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
back of the guitar like you would on an

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.360 
back of the guitar like you would on an
old<00:03:40.720> Fender<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.900> guitar<00:03:44.260> actually<00:03:44.680> feels

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
old Fender the guitar actually feels

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.490 
old Fender the guitar actually feels
pretty<00:03:45.520> much<00:03:45.850> exactly<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.510> same<00:03:46.660> or<00:03:47.200> very

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
pretty much exactly the same or very

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.930 
pretty much exactly the same or very
close<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.280> weight<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:51.340> condition<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.790> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
close in weight to the condition that I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.930 
close in weight to the condition that I
gave<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.200> company<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.890> because<00:03:54.520> they

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
gave it to the company and because they

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.030 
gave it to the company and because they
took<00:03:55.180> some<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.600> wood<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.110> here<00:03:56.890> in

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
took some of the wood out of here in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.440 
took some of the wood out of here in
order<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.310> make<00:03:57.430> space<00:03:57.520> for<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.910> springs<00:03:58.270> in

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
order to make space for the springs in

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.590 
order to make space for the springs in
the<00:03:58.540> system<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.040> extra<00:04:00.940> bit<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.120> metal

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
the system but the extra bit of metal

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.630 
the system but the extra bit of metal
here<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.080> that<00:04:02.410> gets<00:04:02.680> added<00:04:02.950> pretty<00:04:03.430> much

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
here that that gets added pretty much

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.370 
here that that gets added pretty much
was<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> wash<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.750> made<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.020> weight<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.320> the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
was a wash and made the weight of the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.510 
was a wash and made the weight of the
guitar<00:04:05.650> about<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> same<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.880> guitar<00:04:07.210> sounds

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
guitar about the same the guitar sounds

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.320 
guitar about the same the guitar sounds
electronically<00:04:09.520> I<00:04:09.550> would<00:04:09.760> say<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.240> know

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
electronically I would say you know

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.420 
electronically I would say you know
through<00:04:10.570> an<00:04:10.660> amp<00:04:10.840> rather<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:13.030> my<00:04:13.180> ear<00:04:14.430> hardly

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
through an amp rather to my ear hardly

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.409 
through an amp rather to my ear hardly
changed<00:04:15.850> at<00:04:15.910> all<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.419> would<00:04:16.989> say<00:04:17.140> unchanged<00:04:18.419> in

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
changed at all I would say unchanged in

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.310 
changed at all I would say unchanged in
the<00:04:20.260> practical<00:04:20.890> world<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> great

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
the practical world and that is a great

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.500 
the practical world and that is a great
was<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.800> great<00:04:24.100> relief<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.640> me<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.940> know<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.090> mean

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
was a great relief to me you know I mean

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.090 
was a great relief to me you know I mean
this<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:26.230> was<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> grand<00:04:26.740> experiment

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
this is this was a grand experiment

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.760 
this is this was a grand experiment
obviously<00:04:27.850> not<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> lot<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.140> these<00:04:29.260> bridges

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
obviously not a lot of these bridges

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.620 
obviously not a lot of these bridges
have<00:04:30.070> been<00:04:30.220> installed<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.820> guitars<00:04:31.210> let<00:04:31.450> alone

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
have been installed on guitars let alone

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.040 
have been installed on guitars let alone
an<00:04:31.810> old<00:04:31.990> guitar<00:04:32.200> like<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.690> would<00:04:34.840> say

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
an old guitar like this and I would say

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.620 
an old guitar like this and I would say
she<00:04:35.290> passed<00:04:35.560> with<00:04:35.710> flying<00:04:35.950> colors<00:04:36.480> if<00:04:37.480> you

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
she passed with flying colors if you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.830 
she passed with flying colors if you
look<00:04:37.780> at<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> guitar<00:04:38.290> as<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> whole<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:40.600> bridge

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
look at the guitar as a whole the bridge

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.680 
look at the guitar as a whole the bridge
system<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.530> not<00:04:42.010> really<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.430> bad<00:04:42.880> for<00:04:43.600> an

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
system is not really that bad for an
