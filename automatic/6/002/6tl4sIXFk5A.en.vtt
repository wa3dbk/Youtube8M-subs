00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hello to all and to all these 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 captains and now we end up 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 today for a little video of the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.210
 series pay your skin today we get 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.949
 so find with the yop 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 so this is the third character years 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 that I do I have prepared you two 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 skins and in addition to that I reserve you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 a small novelty you will talk about 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.349
 just now so it's gone so a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.600
 little skin that I found that nice with 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.890
 its red blue colors we will say the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 familiar who comes to give a small 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 colorful touch in orange hues 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 blue orange orange yellow that I like 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
 also a shield this talent here a I 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 were looking for a shield that simply 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.000
 bring the red and blue color that I have 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 not found 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 and I found that the style here low 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.579
 was going pretty well I do not know anymore 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 by the way, what exactly is 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.100
 this shield cogez do not hesitate to me 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 correct so supplanted so all 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.229
 simply a duo headdress so lives the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.939
 shield the shot when familiar and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 the cape la ciab good duo lives also seen 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 back including 101 except that I like I 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 find tyrant and makes rather well I know 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 I know we tend the mask and all that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 nice but cooller I put as soon as I 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.930
 put colors a little bit in relation 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 with the staff ie red at 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.280
 level of the cross and shoes the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.520
 blue hair and the blue tee shirt and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.900
 So that's saying it's a little bit surprising 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.250
 the legs remained orange it was 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.790
 for that besides that cutting them 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.799
 Crehange 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 good you can very well change what 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.490
 will make the dunce have no touch 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.130
 orange but in the end this sense not too much 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.869
 short so that's the small novelty 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.870
 in fact it is that I realized 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.980
 account as well 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.380
 the first two times with two 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.180
 classes that I'm going to introduce it was 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.190
 it was only manna without 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.260
 I did not show it 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.150
 overlooked the jumps the females it's 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.410
 While it's a little bit that makes the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.450
 not too much so we got it right away 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.210
 corrected that and we'll show it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.520
 overlooks on accor of women in the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 game so that's it gives that I think 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.710
 it makes quite good too there is no 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.200
 worry about it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.760
 or for those who play 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.170
 women on the game or where the real ones 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.880
 women short so that was it was the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.520
 first staff we go right away 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.420
 interested in the second 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.060
 so if I find them here by here pop 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.670
 so here it is a rather focused stuff 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.810
 black and white boots so I it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.030
 did a little better on dofus you 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.380
 it was more gray white gray threat to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.000
 turn a little pink I find 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 finally, you have to imagine the boots 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.740
 maybe a little whiter all the same 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.850
 so the baby panda that comes to remind the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.910
 touch of black and white I find that 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 it's the perfect familiar to really 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.720
 this black and white shield staff style 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.380
 similar paillard aaron of a wig of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.050
 of pollet and in cap gemini a view of 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.660
 back who is just six years old capgemini capp 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.080
 I think that's where ouakam 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.390
 revenge finally we'll look at that 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.440
 no that's where it's the back view to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.640
 crates that I still like I find 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.390
 that it makes me well I like it 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.280
 staff the body the body finally the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.959
 black clothes and the rest a little white 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.250
 the white hair under the wig I 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.800
 find that that's finally the wig and not 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.380
 necessarily white but maybe a 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.400
 white me I think it makes me good 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.890
 I like it so here is the same 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 see the same thing about the character 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.610
 women 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.840
 I think it comes back and here we are 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.150
 will spend a little bit at the price 1 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.370
 because I think there is a lot that 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.560
 dump them behind their screen of 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.930
 style to the wig she is not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.340
 implanted blah blah so in fact I'm going 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.740
 simply open the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 wig and not implanted 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:04.610
 so so actually the wig 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.340
 is not implanted that's why I 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.830
 will you I chose another what which 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.180
 can be used also for those for 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.190
 this game is for this staff here we go 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.010
 see what it gives so it's not the same 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.190
 charisma nothing but I like it 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.330
 the cap hat kaminski it's called 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.150
 it's a bit in the same good spirit 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.510
 it's not that's me it's still white 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.860
 I like me I think it's a little 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.050
 a little wild beast all I like 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.060
 I think it makes quite good 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.320
 I have others I think it makes 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.150
 well even with the with the hat 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
 camille and is implanted in the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.660
 game so to go back on prices a 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.690
 so there is a cap paul has not suddenly 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.850
 to implant a paillard haye by jamie 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.050
 arrival like Aaron to 20 million 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.640
 so yes good actually it can be 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.990
 a bit expensive but you have to know that the 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.390
 flying shield makes it very good too 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.630
 niort i will try to show you where 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.920
 there are surely some who know 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.110
 do not know I do not have in the inventory 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.490
 will have to go see we'll go see 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.620
 quickly made an art in hd go i'm going 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.120
 keep talking at the same time so the 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.530
 shield the flying shield I find 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.260
 that it's in the same hues of 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.450
 color we will say it's white and white 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.930
 and black also except it's not round there 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.130
 is more square but in the end I 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.570
 find that makes iran is good 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.530
 besides I already wanted to present a 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.450
 year in the video of the panda and du ca 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.860
 crimson used on some staff 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.290
 generally I always do a stuff 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.520
 the black year I like I think it 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.680
 makes good generally I often use 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.780
 either the fool at redon not to nantes at 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.750
 strong perfume brief have you understood either the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.640
 good foot flying this flying bouquet so 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.070
 for those who do not see what I 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.720
 want to talk 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.890
 look it's right now more than 100 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.890
 to be able to watch closely at the same time 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.720
 it can even mind to mons and it's not 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.920
 the same 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.190
 this is not the same luxury we will say 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.720
 but it makes good if there is no problem 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.780
 So here are two thousand notorious camao 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.600
 million functioning be 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.320
 finally able cheaper and that was what 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.320
 thalys da silva so all that to say 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.490
 that a shield to 20 million or so 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.440
 blow the steering wheel to 2000 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.360
 the baby panda so 2000 years ago on 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.530
 my server some who said they 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.770
 were more expensive on theirs but at 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.590
 me it's 2000 hat camille 50 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.419
 miles cape ahead at 18 miles and change 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.350
 the colors 5,500 miles that makes it a 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:34.040
 small total of and if we do not take the 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:39.200
 braille aaron that's about 600 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:42.050
 miles brought back to 550 560 8 588 but in 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.910
 570 however 570000 for this stuff 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.430
 I think it's rather not 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.720
 expensive for the chuv so we're on a 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.240
 web hats that cost 100 miles to 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.550
 about the cape which costs about 50 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.860
 thousand also the status of the shot that has 5 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.560
 million earlier 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.990
 certainly doubled the baby panda in 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.410
 the other excuse me add the babies 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.169
 pandas so that's 2 2 million holy 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.880
 on the other side so we had 5 + 4 on 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.370
 is about 9 million or so we add 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.890
 the 500 miles and the 150000 we are at 9 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.160
 million six hundred and fifty million six 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.350
 hundred and fifty years it's still too 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.000
 reasonable so that was both 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.710
 staffs and introduce themselves to me I like 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.210
 well the pyrite paul hecht what is his 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.390
 style that would be nice if it implants 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.650
 maybe we play maybe one day 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.580
 So here it was for the yom do not hesitate 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.590
 not really what you think 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.169
 do not hesitate to share your skis no 6 1 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.570
 I think there are some who must have 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.890
 nice skins on their class it was 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.240
