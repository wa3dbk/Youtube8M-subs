00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hello guys 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.539
 we should use antivirus in our 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 smartphones and tablets 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.619
 well let's break the answer to this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.610
 question to the three operating systems 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.360
 most used in these devices 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 lately what would that be eeci 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.269
 windows phone and android 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 you go with your limitations until what 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.280
 a lot of people complain about apple's 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.090
 block and that whole thing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.899
 it's a safe system it's not there 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.129
 need in their use 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 conventional way of using the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.830
 individuals apple checks all 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.289
 applications you have in your story 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 with that the security is much greater 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:16.229
 when some application is requires some 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 type of security is unlocking of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.950
 some security tool is warned 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 on the Tripoli screen until I make a video is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 on these custom keyboards in the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 I'll tell you a lot about this 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 subject but in another video 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 well in irs it is not necessary to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 use the antivirus if you use the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.850
 system the correct way to use 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.509
 we buy apps in the apple store 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.750
 everything original everything right right but 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 if you use jailbreak and other 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.520
 things 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 something I do not recommend right but it is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.990
 in which case you should use a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.670
 antivirus no irs windows phone windows 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 phone today is the most secure system 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.509
 among the 3 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.329
 microsoft has worked very well in 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.810
 windows phone and wanting or not 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.870
 is a very old company related to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.420
 lives is a company that suffers many 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.430
 attacks because it is the operating system 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.630
 most used in desktops and notebooks as 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 code of the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.080
 windows phone is the same as in windows 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.170
 for example windows 8 desktop 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.470
 currently being used in 2 10 goes 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.960
 further unify this system 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.660
 windows phone security is very 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.180
 good what you get is the amount of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.790
 windows phone apps but this is 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.780
 a subject for another video but the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.300
 system itself is very secure but its 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 desktop similarity 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.760
 the ease of programming for this 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.800
 system is interesting 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.130
 sometimes the use of an antivirus 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.550
 depending on how they are used 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.390
 already in the case of android the danger is already 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.540
 bigger 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.880
 this does not mean in any case 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.330
 that the system is bad 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.370
 android today and fight for 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.990
 match like s 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.730
 only the versatility of android 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:37.230
 the simplicity of having applications 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.470
 google and does not enforce applications on 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.810
 your store in order to have more 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.850
 applications to increase the range of 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.420
 applications where it has 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.400
 to exceed the s which is the most 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.350
 old device is mobile devices 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 made the system more 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 is an open system and is not 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.959
 same as linux anyone can modify 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.560
 that there then on android 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:13.650
 vulnerability to invasions and infections 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.549
 pirated software is very large 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.400
 an example of this before having netflix 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.550
 a widely used service nowadays 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.710
 in android did not create apps 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.020
 counterfeited as using the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.690
 netflix logo and as if it were 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.479
 netflix you entered typed your 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.530
 user and password and the person stole your 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.760
 username and password 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.110
 out the fact that a lot of people use 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.240
 It's the same account or emails 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.790
 same password for everything happens seen at 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.040
 person got your email and password from 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.430
 netflix sometimes got your mail and 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.920
 all your own password and mail and password 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.190
 where I've done until explaining video 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.210
 about the correct way to create passwords 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.280
 right so the android is more vulnerable 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.890
 does not mean that the system of one is a 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.120
 great operating system 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.850
 Of course, the major problem of 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.830
 android is the companies that sometimes 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.280
 system such as samsung and not 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.970
 use it more cleanly as the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.460
 nexes google then launches the links 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.440
 Sims are the best gadgets but 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.150
 android case for having this 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.290
 versatility 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.840
 in this use closer to the desktop 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.540
 I would rather recommend the use of 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.300
 antivirus for this system 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.300
 Okay, I hope the video was very 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.590
 useful for you liked each click 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.570
 I liked it down here. 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.900
 be sure to sign up for the channel to 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.210
 receive the news of the channel and 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.000
 brand gear to receive by mail 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.170
 ok a big hug and even the 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.530
 next video 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:08.890
 the brigade persisted the mind that 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.890
 He leaned against the cup and thus more channel.
