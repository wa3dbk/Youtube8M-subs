00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
and you can see that it does overheat if

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.380 
and you can see that it does overheat if
you<00:03:14.620> hold<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.890> too<00:03:15.070> long<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:16.090> don't<00:03:16.270> want

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
you hold it too long so you don't want

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:56.430 
you hold it too long so you don't want
to<00:03:16.450> do<00:03:16.510> that

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.870 

it's<00:03:56.830> like<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.130> on<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.280> boss<00:03:59.310> got<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.340> huge<00:04:01.030> gun

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:16.729 

rocket<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:15.490> it's<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.730> one-hit<00:04:16.120> kill<00:04:16.390> for

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
rocket it's like it's a one-hit kill for

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.760 
rocket it's like it's a one-hit kill for
most<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.890> these<00:04:17.980> enemies<00:04:18.400> are<00:04:19.650> using<00:04:20.650> their

most of these enemies are using their

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.810 
most of these enemies are using their
rocket<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:21.250> that's<00:04:21.400> kind<00:04:21.640> of<00:04:21.670> cool<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:24.670> it

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
able to play it for obvious reasons I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.770 
able to play it for obvious reasons I
only<00:05:36.030> have<00:05:36.270> two<00:05:36.540> hands<00:05:36.810> but<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.620> can<00:05:37.770> see<00:05:38.780> that

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
only have two hands but you can see that

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.100 
only have two hands but you can see that
they<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:39.990> move<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:41.240> we<00:05:42.240> are<00:05:42.389> connected<00:05:42.870> pretty

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
they do move and we are connected pretty

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:54.800 
they do move and we are connected pretty
cool<00:05:43.350> right

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.560

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
let's just advance just a bit before we

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:07.670 
let's just advance just a bit before we
wrap<00:05:57.870> up<00:05:57.900> all<00:06:04.730> right<00:06:05.840> so<00:06:06.840> once<00:06:07.080> again<00:06:07.200> this<00:06:07.470> was

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680

a<00:06:07.710> look<00:06:07.950> at<00:06:08.130> gorilla<00:06:08.460> Bob<00:06:08.970> we<00:06:09.420> think<00:06:09.660> it's

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
a look at gorilla Bob we think it's

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.630
