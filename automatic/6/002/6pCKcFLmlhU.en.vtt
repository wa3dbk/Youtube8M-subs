power while you're hitting another thing

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.810 
power while you're hitting another thing
I<00:03:05.180> forgot<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.480> mention<00:03:05.600> is<00:03:05.959> teleport<00:03:06.820> some

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
I forgot to mention is teleport some

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.130 
I forgot to mention is teleport some
people<00:03:08.090> aren't<00:03:08.180> using<00:03:08.360> teleport<00:03:08.900> with<00:03:08.990> this

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
people aren't using teleport with this

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.860 
people aren't using teleport with this
build<00:03:09.380> but<00:03:09.590> i<00:03:09.650> think<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.220> crucial<00:03:10.870> because

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
build but i think it's crucial because

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.390 
build but i think it's crucial because
if<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.230> get<00:03:12.410> into<00:03:12.530> situations<00:03:12.800> where<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
if you get into situations where you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.340 
if you get into situations where you
have<00:03:13.490> our<00:03:13.760> cane<00:03:14.030> centuries<00:03:14.570> going<00:03:14.840> around<00:03:15.020> too

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
have our cane centuries going around too

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.920 
have our cane centuries going around too
much<00:03:15.530> molten<00:03:16.010> too<00:03:16.910> many<00:03:17.090> guys<00:03:17.270> then<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.780> can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
much molten too many guys then you can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.680 
much molten too many guys then you can
just<00:03:18.050> teleport<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.120> fracture

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
just teleport out and I like fracture

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.930 
just teleport out and I like fracture
because<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.320> causes<00:03:21.560> distractions<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.760> it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
because it causes distractions and it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.430 
because it causes distractions and it
can<00:03:23.120> save<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.750> lot<00:03:24.050> teleports<00:03:24.709> been<00:03:24.860> huge

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
can save you a lot teleports been huge

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.479 
can save you a lot teleports been huge
another<00:03:27.440> thing<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.959> get<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.890> good

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
another thing is if you get a good

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.910 
another thing is if you get a good
build-up<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:33.050> crits<00:03:33.380> high<00:03:33.620> because

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
build-up of and your crits high because

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.949 
build-up of and your crits high because
when<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.400> prox<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.970> holds<00:03:35.209> for<00:03:35.360> 12<00:03:35.600> seconds

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
when this prox it holds for 12 seconds

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.560 
when this prox it holds for 12 seconds
you<00:03:36.410> can<00:03:36.530> teleport<00:03:37.070> from<00:03:37.190> group<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.610> group<00:03:37.760> so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
you can teleport from group to group so

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.940 
you can teleport from group to group so
basically<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.140> never<00:03:39.350> lose<00:03:39.560> your<00:03:39.800> momentum

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
basically you never lose your momentum

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.520 
basically you never lose your momentum
you<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.640> kill<00:03:41.360> one<00:03:41.540> group<00:03:41.780> your<00:03:42.140> this<00:03:42.380> is

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
you just kill one group your this is

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.990 
you just kill one group your this is
still<00:03:42.739> proc<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.430> teleport<00:03:43.700> into

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
still proc and you just teleport into

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.650 
still proc and you just teleport into
the<00:03:44.120> second<00:03:44.480> group<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.810> continue<00:03:45.200> creating

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
the second group and continue creating

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.699 
the second group and continue creating
so<00:03:47.660> if<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.780> guys<00:03:47.930> have<00:03:48.110> any<00:03:48.200> questions<00:03:48.620> about
