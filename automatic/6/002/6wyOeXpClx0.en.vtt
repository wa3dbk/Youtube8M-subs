00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.860 

register<00:02:56.090> complete<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.239> connected

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
register complete so now it's connected

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.620 
register complete so now it's connected
and<00:03:01.209> then<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.480> can<00:03:02.630> see<00:03:02.660> there<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.980> blue

and then if you can see there that blue

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.750 
and then if you can see there that blue
next<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.750> name<00:03:06.019> means<00:03:06.860> it's<00:03:07.040> connected<00:03:07.610> and

so these are the devices which are
Bluetooth<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.680> connected<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.340> if<00:03:13.910> you're

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
Bluetooth and connected so if you're

then that should show up here with the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.080 
then that should show up here with the
headset<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.920> that's<00:03:21.920> how<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.160> connect<00:03:22.730> a
