00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so let's get started here so you have a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.900 
so let's get started here so you have a
batch<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> mutants<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.580> several

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
batch of mutants I have just several

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089 
batch of mutants I have just several
different<00:00:27.330> similar<00:00:27.990> scenarios<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
different similar scenarios here all the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.200 
different similar scenarios here all the
same<00:00:29.250> amount<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> minutes<00:00:29.789> all<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> same

same amount of minutes all the same
amount<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> thor's<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> meters<00:00:31.980> do

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
amount of thor's and what the meters do

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.830 
amount of thor's and what the meters do
when<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> send<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.759> location<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> they'll<00:00:33.630> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
when you send to location is they'll all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.799 
when you send to location is they'll all
come<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.350> location<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.510> then<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.660> will

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
come to that location and then they will

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470 
come to that location and then they will
spread<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.290> now<00:00:38.040> once<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.610> spread<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.000> they

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
spread out now once they spread out they

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
spread out now once they spread out they
will<00:00:39.629> maintain<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.590> formation<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.430> long<00:00:41.700> as

position<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> attack<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
position or if you want you can attack a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
position or if you want you can attack a
Thor<00:01:32.909> directly<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.900> gonna<00:01:34.020> cause<00:01:34.290> them

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
Thor directly but it's gonna cause them

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
Thor directly but it's gonna cause them
to<00:01:34.560> clump<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:35.490> try

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to clump up a little bit so let's try

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
to clump up a little bit so let's try
that<00:01:35.939> first<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.930> float<00:01:37.170> over<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.500> Thor

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that first I'm gonna float over the Thor

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
that first I'm gonna float over the Thor
and<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.840> attack<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> them

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and then I'm gonna attack one of them

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
and then I'm gonna attack one of them
see<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.189> guys<00:01:41.220> over<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.759> clumping<00:01:42.090> up

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
see these guys over here are clumping up

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
see these guys over here are clumping up
a<00:01:42.270> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.540> taking<00:01:42.840> some<00:01:42.990> splash<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.500> look

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
a little bit taking some splash but look

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.719 
a little bit taking some splash but look
at<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> difference

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
at the difference

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
at the difference
these<00:01:44.880> Thor's<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.360> doing<00:01:45.659> damage<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.409> one

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
these Thor's are doing damage to one

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
these Thor's are doing damage to one
muta<00:01:47.009> at<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> time<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
muta at a time because they have that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.149 
muta at a time because they have that
nice<00:01:48.600> spread<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.439> basically<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> be

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
nice spread they basically have to be

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.800 
nice spread they basically have to be
inside<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> each<00:01:50.700> other<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.329> any

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
inside of each other to take any

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.980 
inside of each other to take any
damage<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.320> let's<00:01:52.470> compare<00:01:52.799> Group<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.990> group

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
damage so let's compare Group one group

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.280 
damage so let's compare Group one group
two<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.770> looks<00:01:55.920> better<00:01:56.329> Group<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.509> has<00:01:57.780> 20

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
two what looks better Group one has 20

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
two what looks better Group one has 20
Group<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:58.920> has<00:01:59.189> 12<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.990> lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.380> are

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
Group two has 12 and a lot of them are

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.279 
Group two has 12 and a lot of them are
much<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.890> weaker<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.909> let's<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> next

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
much much weaker now let's do the next

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.170 
much much weaker now let's do the next
scenario<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:05.039> which<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> best

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
scenario here which is actually the best

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.839 
scenario here which is actually the best
way<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> magic<00:02:07.320> box<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.770> opinion<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
way for the magic box in my opinion it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.669 
way for the magic box in my opinion it
doesn't<00:02:09.179> involve<00:02:09.420> focus<00:02:09.840> firing<00:02:10.110> Thor's<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
doesn't involve focus firing Thor's you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.350 
doesn't involve focus firing Thor's you
just<00:02:10.860> fly<00:02:11.370> over<00:02:11.400> them<00:02:11.790> make<00:02:12.000> sure<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
just fly over them make sure not to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.620 
just fly over them make sure not to
right-click<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> Thor<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:14.420> then<00:02:15.420> just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
right-click on a Thor and then just

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.270 
right-click on a Thor and then just
press<00:02:15.810> stop<00:02:16.140> while<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.620> over<00:02:16.890> them<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
press stop while you're over them and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.729 
press stop while you're over them and
just<00:02:17.819> check<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> damage<00:02:18.599> every<00:02:19.319> Muta<00:02:19.620> is

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
just check out the damage every Muta is

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.699 
just check out the damage every Muta is
only<00:02:19.950> being<00:02:20.220> hit<00:02:20.430> once<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:22.140> there's<00:02:22.530> no

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
only being hit once like there's no

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.220 
only being hit once like there's no
splash<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.459> at<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
splash going on at all and this is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
splash going on at all and this is
pretty<00:02:25.410> incredible<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.160> ask<00:02:26.280> me

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
pretty incredible if you ask me

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
pretty incredible if you ask me
so<00:02:27.060> those<00:02:27.540> pillars<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.049> take<00:02:28.230> him<00:02:28.350> down

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
so those pillars you can take him down

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.470 
so those pillars you can take him down
how<00:02:28.680> many<00:02:28.739> meters<00:02:29.160> 20<00:02:29.549> meters<00:02:29.580> once<00:02:30.030> again<00:02:30.299> but

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
how many meters 20 meters once again but

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.960 
how many meters 20 meters once again but
look<00:02:30.600> at<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> health<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.080> these<00:02:31.560> meters

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
look at the health of these meters

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.170 
look at the health of these meters
compared<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> these<00:02:33.150> meters<00:02:34.940> these<00:02:35.940> meters

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
compared to these meters these meters

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.360 
compared to these meters these meters
with<00:02:36.420> lot<00:02:36.630> weaker<00:02:37.049> these<00:02:37.230> ones<00:02:37.470> actually<00:02:37.650> did

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
with lot weaker these ones actually did

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.100 
with lot weaker these ones actually did
about<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.819> same<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.180> these<00:02:39.360> ones<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:39.930> too

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
about the same as these ones so not too

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.620 
about the same as these ones so not too
bad<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> I'll<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:42.000> show<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.510> guys

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
bad and I'll just show it to you guys

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.130 
bad and I'll just show it to you guys
once<00:02:43.080> or<00:02:43.290> twice<00:02:43.500> more<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.660> let's<00:02:45.660> attack<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
once or twice more here let's attack the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.539 
once or twice more here let's attack the
Thor's<00:02:46.349> again<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.799> see<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> turns<00:02:47.430> out

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
Thor's again and see how that turns out

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.979 
Thor's again and see how that turns out
let's<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> tag<00:02:48.269> command<00:02:48.630> actually

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
let's just do a tag command actually

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.300 
let's just do a tag command actually
attack<00:02:49.260> command<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> not<00:02:49.830> something<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.160> want

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
attack command is not something you want

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.130 
attack command is not something you want
to<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.459> either<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:51.540> they're<00:02:51.750> gonna<00:02:51.810> clump

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
to do either for one they're gonna clump

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.390 
to do either for one they're gonna clump
up<00:02:52.290> again<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.680> also<00:02:53.040> they're<00:02:53.190> not<00:02:53.220> gonna

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
up again and also they're not gonna

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.190 
up again and also they're not gonna
focus<00:02:53.670> bar<00:02:53.970> down<00:02:54.180> any<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.780> these<00:02:54.959> stores<00:02:57.200> so

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
focus bar down any of these stores so

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.300 
focus bar down any of these stores so
you'll<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.530> they're<00:02:58.709> doing<00:02:59.040> they're<00:02:59.280> doing

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you'll see they're doing they're doing

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.130 
you'll see they're doing they're doing
okay<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.359> better<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.720> because<00:03:00.930> I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
okay a little better just because I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.080 
okay a little better just because I
didn't<00:03:01.410> clump<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.890> single<00:03:02.160> Thor<00:03:02.489> but<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
didn't clump up on a single Thor but a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.170 
didn't clump up on a single Thor but a
lot<00:03:03.570> going<00:03:04.019> down<00:03:04.200> Wow<00:03:04.920> only<00:03:05.220> eight<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:05.880> attack

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
lot going down Wow only eight so attack

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
going to go down all at once but this is

just incredible it just shows you how
effective<00:03:38.819> Muniz<00:03:39.389> can<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.660> when<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:39.989> not

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
clumping up against these spoilers so it

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.840 
clumping up against these spoilers so it
doesn't<00:03:43.440> really<00:03:43.620> require<00:03:43.799> much<00:03:44.010> spread<00:03:44.579> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
doesn't really require much spread to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.340 
doesn't really require much spread to
prevent<00:03:45.239> any<00:03:45.420> splash<00:03:45.690> damage<00:03:45.900> from<00:03:46.200> these

now<00:04:08.520> surviving<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.150> twenty<00:04:09.480> once<00:04:09.750> again<00:04:10.080> now

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
the initial number is twenty four so I

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.699 
the initial number is twenty four so I
only<00:04:13.920> lost<00:04:14.220> four<00:04:14.760> Mutis<00:04:15.239> against<00:04:15.810> four<00:04:16.230> Thor's

only lost four Muniz that is incredible
I<00:04:20.940> think<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.019> gonna<00:04:22.169> change<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.770> way

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
I think this is gonna change the way

that Zerg is played versus a first mech

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.960 
that Zerg is played versus a first mech

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.060 
anti-air like Vikings I don't know but
it<00:04:33.720> seems<00:04:33.930> like<00:04:34.080> muta<00:04:34.410> family<00:04:34.740> would<00:04:34.919> be<00:04:35.040> a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
it seems like muta family would be a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.030 
it seems like muta family would be a
extremely<00:04:35.940> deadly<00:04:36.330> combo<00:04:39.770> but<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.800> hope<00:04:40.950> you

amazing<00:04:46.710> because<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:48.090> has<00:04:48.240> been<00:04:48.360> in<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
amazing because this has been in the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.270 
amazing because this has been in the
game<00:04:48.750> all<00:04:49.020> along<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.500> people<00:04:49.650> are<00:04:49.889> just<00:04:50.130> now

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
figuring it out I think it's just
