00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
confused mainly because there's no such

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.180 
confused mainly because there's no such
thing<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.850> daily<00:01:09.420> dose<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.050> antioxidants<00:01:11.039> if

thing as a daily dose of antioxidants if
a<00:01:11.820> product<00:01:12.180> were<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> claim<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> contains

a product were to claim that it contains
for<00:01:14.910> example<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.720> daily<00:01:16.289> dose<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.649> calcium<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
for example a daily dose of calcium I

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.410 
for example a daily dose of calcium I
can<00:01:18.300> put<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.660> into<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.140> context<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> say<00:01:20.520> okay

can put that into a context and say okay

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
can put that into a context and say okay
they<00:01:21.600> probably<00:01:21.899> mean<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.619> daily<00:01:23.009> value<00:01:23.430> which

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
they probably mean the daily value which

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
they probably mean the daily value which
is<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.940> thousand<00:01:24.600> milligrams<00:01:24.950> with

three<00:03:50.670> servings<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:52.109> 1.2<00:03:53.109> grams<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:54.040> trans<00:03:54.280> fat

three servings is 1.2 grams of trans fat
and<00:03:55.299> that<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.989> enough<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.739> really<00:03:57.069> cause<00:03:58.380> heart

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
and that is enough to really cause heart

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.870 
and that is enough to really cause heart
problems<00:03:59.560> especially<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:00.549> you're<00:04:00.639> doing<00:04:00.730> this

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
problems especially if you're doing this

problems especially if you're doing this
on<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.090> daily<00:04:01.299> basis<00:04:01.840> trans<00:04:02.230> fats<00:04:02.530> are<00:04:02.799> really

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
on a daily basis trans fats are really

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.470 
on a daily basis trans fats are really
really<00:04:04.709> terrible<00:04:05.709> for<00:04:06.100> heart<00:04:06.370> health<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.329> the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
really terrible for heart health so the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.410 
really terrible for heart health so the
key<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.079> avoid<00:04:08.500> them<00:04:08.799> so<00:04:09.579> how<00:04:10.120> do<00:04:10.180> you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
key here is to avoid them so how do you

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.559 
key here is to avoid them so how do you
know<00:04:10.660> if<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.230> 0<00:04:11.680> grams<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.670> trans<00:04:12.880> fat<00:04:13.299> per

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
know if a 0 grams of trans fat per

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.900 
know if a 0 grams of trans fat per
serving<00:04:13.600> food<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.380> telling<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.769> truth<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
serving food is telling the truth you

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.390 
serving food is telling the truth you

concentrate<00:05:14.919> is<00:05:15.040> basically<00:05:15.580> if<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.729> take<00:05:15.970> a

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
concentrate is basically if you take a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.020 
concentrate is basically if you take a
fruit<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:16.810> all<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:17.650> have<00:05:17.889> left<00:05:17.919> is<00:05:18.520> the

fruit and all you have left is the
sugary<00:05:19.540> liquid<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.380> then<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:20.560> make<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.919> into

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
sugary liquid and then you make it into

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.750 
sugary liquid and then you make it into
a<00:05:21.340> puree<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:21.970> sorts<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:23.080> has<00:05:23.380> no<00:05:23.950> nutrition
