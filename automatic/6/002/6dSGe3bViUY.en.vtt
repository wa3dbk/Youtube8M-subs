00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 as they had asked sometimes 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.289
 previous to see if you could 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.359
 modify the lever and I opened it 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.390
 and this to open it you have to remove the 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.619
 gummies that come in the cap below 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.840
 come these gummies that are here 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.469
 they are going here so that the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.449
 the screws down there are the screws 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.930
 they are any cross screws 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.930
 thing that you can use any 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 screwdriver 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.970
 in this stage of matters then as 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.500
 origin the previous video does not serve as 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.820
 nothing 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.790
 then we open it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.040
 in the part of here comes the restrictor 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.739
 the respect to the square that many of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.360
 you want to know if that change does not 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 apparently if you change you have these 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.100
 pieces here that are made towards a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 side and can be removed and changed by 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.080
 another if they are fixed they have the switches or 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 is not like a shanghua a lever 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.170
 zhang or a lever 6000 its original more 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.020
 well they did me as a fusion of 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 national lever with a lever 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.160
 Japanese then the receiver if it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.009
 can replace anything else there is that 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.450
 remove these you have to pull these parts 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.850
 to be able to remove the restrictor 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 well as the buttons also have a few 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.360
 screws in the part of here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.930
 this part 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.930
 remove 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.730
 to replace buttons buttons 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.940
 as I said the description of the lever 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.450
 they are anwar types 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.010
 in this part the brown and you can 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.810
 remove the button in order to be 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.500
 interchanged 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 it really is simple to do it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.120
 inside it does not take much science and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 you can change it for a few buttons one 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.920
 little more 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.810
 finer as it is water or it got the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.320
 lever is what I do not know I think not 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.360
 it can be replaced since it is one as 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.960
 I said it's a merger of national leverage 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 with a Japanese lever then if the 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.220
 it replaces is because there is no connector or 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.530
 you will have to be a direct connector 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.500
 here 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.360
 to be replaced by the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.020
 lever works well that is to say no 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.819
 nothing to the levers is much better than 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.080
 the national levers there are people who do not 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.850
 he likes it because he is very 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.310
 it's soft and the national lever is very 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.650
 very hard with national I mean in the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.990
 Mexican territory because they are so 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 I'm Mexican then 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.060
 then with this we finish the video 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.060
 I hope you can solve your doubts 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.060
 goodbye
