here's<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.990> lovely<00:00:07.259> little<00:00:07.529> problem<00:00:08.099> go<00:00:08.670> to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
here's a lovely little problem go to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.960 
here's a lovely little problem go to
start<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.269> now<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.690> sunflowers<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.309> what

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
start this now for sunflowers so what

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.629 
start this now for sunflowers so what
could<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.559> investigate<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.460> go<00:00:14.580> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
could we investigate for this you go to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.570 
could we investigate for this you go to
work<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.030> pairs<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.690> i'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.019> to<00:00:16.139> give<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
work in pairs and i'm going to give you

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.230 
work in pairs and i'm going to give you
you're<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> work<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.000> either

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you're going to work with either

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
you're going to work with either
sunflower<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.960> today's<00:00:19.440> workshop<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.250> were

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sunflower in today's workshop we were

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820 
sunflower in today's workshop we were
modeling<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.720> new<00:00:21.869> metal<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.410> teaching

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
modeling and a new metal for teaching

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.189 
modeling and a new metal for teaching
algebra<00:00:23.160> alright<00:00:24.029> well<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:25.020> be<00:00:25.050> an

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
algebra alright well this would be an

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.950 
algebra alright well this would be an
area<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.470> mats<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.390> most<00:00:27.390> students<00:00:27.810> would

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
area of mats that most students would

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
area of mats that most students would
have<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.289> difficulty<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.090> because

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
have some difficulty with because

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450 
have some difficulty with because
traditionally<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.900> taught<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.830> examined

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
traditionally it is taught and examined

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
traditionally it is taught and examined
in<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.179> procedure<00:00:33.629> away<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.949> with<00:00:35.100> very

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in a procedure away with that with very

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.969 
in a procedure away with that with very
little<00:00:35.550> context<00:00:36.149> or<00:00:36.239> application<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.530> even

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979 
little context or application so even

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.160 
little context or application so even
with<00:00:38.460> students<00:00:39.089> very<00:00:39.210> high<00:00:39.479> high<00:00:39.809> achieving

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
with students very high high achieving

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.069 
with students very high high achieving
students<00:00:40.859> they<00:00:41.729> at<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:42.059> point<00:00:42.359> hit<00:00:42.929> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
students they at some point hit the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.500 
students they at some point hit the
challenges<00:00:43.589> with<00:00:44.039> algebra<00:00:44.639> so<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.359> going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
challenges with algebra so we're going

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.660 
challenges with algebra so we're going
to<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.839> look<00:00:46.109> recession<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.859> how<00:00:47.339> can

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to take a look recession and see how can

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.590 
to take a look recession and see how can
we<00:00:47.819> actually<00:00:47.969> increase<00:00:48.420> their<00:00:48.569> understanding

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
we actually increase their understanding

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
we actually increase their understanding
of<00:00:49.409> algebra<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:50.429> I've<00:00:50.579> learned<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.879> lot<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of algebra well I've learned a lot of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.079 
of algebra well I've learned a lot of
new<00:00:51.089> IDs<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.869> it's<00:00:52.429> renewed<00:00:53.429> my<00:00:53.639> enthusiasm

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
new IDs and it's renewed my enthusiasm

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.090 
new IDs and it's renewed my enthusiasm
for<00:00:54.239> getting<00:00:55.049> back<00:00:55.199> into<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.499> classroom<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
for getting back into the classroom and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.879 
for getting back into the classroom and
sighing<00:00:56.999> over<00:00:57.149> two<00:00:57.329> different<00:00:57.659> concepts<00:00:58.619> and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
sighing over two different concepts and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.930 
sighing over two different concepts and
would<00:00:59.309> in<00:01:00.299> a<00:01:00.420> refreshing<00:01:00.899> porch<00:01:01.760> anything<00:01:02.760> we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
would in a refreshing porch anything we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.670 
would in a refreshing porch anything we
don't

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
don't

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.030 
don't
horizon<00:01:04.489> drone<00:01:04.780> family<00:01:05.780> there

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
horizon drone family there

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.240 
horizon drone family there
the<00:01:09.040> same<00:01:09.250> reasoning<00:01:09.729> right<00:01:10.630> yeah<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.560> think<00:01:11.890> so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
the same reasoning right yeah I think so

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
the same reasoning right yeah I think so
yeah

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
yeah

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.399 
yeah
values

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.800 

no<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.649> I'd<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.759> I<00:01:23.680> playwriting

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
no I I'd like that I playwriting

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.240 
no I I'd like that I playwriting
Santilli<00:01:26.810> interior<00:01:27.259> except<00:01:27.649> for<00:01:28.330> together

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
Santilli interior except for together

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.990 
Santilli interior except for together
that's<00:01:31.250> what<00:01:31.369> nothing<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.700> do<00:01:31.880> especially

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
that's what nothing to do especially

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.780 
that's what nothing to do especially
when<00:01:32.539> you're<00:01:32.630> talking<00:01:32.750> about<00:01:33.049> tnite

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
when you're talking about tnite

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.150 
when you're talking about tnite
Junior's<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:36.050> have<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.380> guide<00:01:36.680> us<00:01:36.920> children

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
Junior's you have to guide us children

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.220 
Junior's you have to guide us children
yes<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.480> get<00:01:38.600> them<00:01:38.720> freedom<00:01:38.960> because

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
yes you have to get them freedom because

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.110 
yes you have to get them freedom because
the<00:01:39.350> guide<00:01:39.530> them<00:01:39.740> as<00:01:39.830> well<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.550> lot<00:01:41.000> of

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
the guide them as well so lot of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.700 
the guide them as well so lot of
challenges<00:01:41.300> I<00:01:41.750> would<00:01:42.170> say<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.500> main

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
challenges I would say the main

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.700 
challenges I would say the main
challenges<00:01:42.740> are<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:44.150> shift<00:01:44.690> in<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.080> way<00:01:45.380> we

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
challenges are a shift in the way we

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.250 
challenges are a shift in the way we
teach<00:01:46.340> in<00:01:46.550> our<00:01:46.640> classrooms<00:01:47.260> traditionally

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
teach in our classrooms traditionally

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260 
teach in our classrooms traditionally
maths<00:01:48.470> teachers<00:01:48.920> would<00:01:49.250> teach<00:01:49.400> very<00:01:49.640> much<00:01:50.120> in

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
maths teachers would teach very much in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.090 
maths teachers would teach very much in
isolation<00:01:50.720> teachers<00:01:51.350> have<00:01:51.500> said<00:01:51.530> they<00:01:51.800> need

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
isolation teachers have said they need

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.940 
isolation teachers have said they need
to<00:01:52.460> work<00:01:52.610> more<00:01:52.640> collaboratively<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:54.650> tend

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
to work more collaboratively so we tend

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.400 
to work more collaboratively so we tend
to<00:01:55.010> work<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:55.280> your<00:01:55.340> own<00:01:55.490> whereas<00:01:56.060> now<00:01:56.410> teachers

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
to work on your own whereas now teachers

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.400 
to work on your own whereas now teachers
need<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.880> get<00:01:58.880> together<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.540> share<00:01:59.810> resources

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
need to get together and share resources

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.550 
need to get together and share resources
divide<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.550> workload<00:02:02.140> chat<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> bit<00:02:03.290> more

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
divide the workload chat a bit more

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.040 
divide the workload chat a bit more
about<00:02:03.620> what's<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.400> on<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.940> what's<00:02:05.780> working

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
about what's going on and what's working

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.590 
about what's going on and what's working
and<00:02:06.290> what's<00:02:06.530> not<00:02:06.620> working<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.340> think<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
and what's not working I think the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.999 
and what's not working I think the
challenge<00:02:09.020> with<00:02:09.170> students<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.770> for<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
challenge with students and for the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.390 
challenge with students and for the
parents<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.550> well<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.570> parents<00:02:12.400> comments

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
parents as well is the parents comments

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.490 
parents as well is the parents comments
sometimes<00:02:13.610> are<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.750> you're<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.020> doing<00:02:15.260> maths

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
sometimes are but you're not doing maths

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.010 
sometimes are but you're not doing maths
it's<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> maths<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.209> we<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.810> not

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
it's not the maths that we know it's not

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's not the maths that we know it's not
what<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.770> consider<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.459> be<00:02:19.580> algebra<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:23.270> think

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
what we consider to be algebra I think

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.880 
what we consider to be algebra I think
it's<00:02:24.050> really

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:41.580 

so<00:02:29.819> they<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> they<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.900> causation

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.770 

lips<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.879> little<00:02:43.750> always

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.280 

yeah<00:02:52.880> they<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.180> haven't<00:02:54.480> Jordan<00:02:54.990> open

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
yeah they have two haven't Jordan open

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
yeah they have two haven't Jordan open
mind<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.920> see<00:02:56.130> math<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:56.670> creative

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
mind and see math is a more creative

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
mind and see math is a more creative
subject<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.260> themselves<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.100> challenge

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
subject for themselves so the challenge

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.840 
subject for themselves so the challenge
for<00:02:59.490> them<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.750> realize<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.110> Max<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.890> all

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
for them is to realize that Max is all

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.400 
for them is to realize that Max is all
around<00:03:03.150> us<00:03:03.360> it's<00:03:03.569> very<00:03:03.780> creative<00:03:04.230> it's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
around us it's very creative it's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.250 
around us it's very creative it's
artistic<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> you've<00:03:06.180> done<00:03:06.330> your<00:03:06.390> table<00:03:07.020> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
artistic so you've done your table you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.699 
artistic so you've done your table you
do<00:03:07.440> move<00:03:07.620> bath<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.810> went<00:03:10.080> ahead<00:03:10.170> myself

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
do move bath and you went ahead myself

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.540 
do move bath and you went ahead myself
yeah<00:03:11.160> you're<00:03:11.310> fine<00:03:11.580> produced<00:03:12.420> was<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> huge

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
yeah you're fine produced was a huge

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.190 
yeah you're fine produced was a huge
amount<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.819> teachers<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> take<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.630> board<00:03:15.930> as

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
amount for teachers to take on board as

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280 
amount for teachers to take on board as
the<00:03:16.410> workshops<00:03:16.860> are<00:03:17.100> unfolding<00:03:18.080> teachers<00:03:19.080> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the workshops are unfolding teachers and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.570 
the workshops are unfolding teachers and
alligator<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.950> benefits<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.459> their

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
alligator see the benefits in their

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.180 
alligator see the benefits in their
classroom<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.290> there<00:03:22.830> would<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:22.980> less

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
classroom so there would be less

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.430 
classroom so there would be less
concerned<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.910> less<00:03:24.180> skepticism<00:03:25.130> showing<00:03:26.130> us

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
concerned and less skepticism showing us

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.480 
concerned and less skepticism showing us
the<00:03:27.980> matter<00:03:28.160> which<00:03:28.340> 2.22<00:03:28.940> yeah<00:03:29.390> yeah<00:03:30.310> it's<00:03:31.310> not

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
the matter which 2.22 yeah yeah it's not

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.840 
the matter which 2.22 yeah yeah it's not
saying<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.240> one<00:03:33.230> or<00:03:33.800> two<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.700> will

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
saying that one or two and it will

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.310 
saying that one or two and it will
enhance<00:03:35.030> applies<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.900> flowers<00:03:36.170> are

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
enhance applies for the flowers are

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.230 
enhance applies for the flowers are
growing<00:03:36.410> long<00:03:36.680> time<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.580> just<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.910> constant

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
growing long time so just the constant

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940 
growing long time so just the constant

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
in on the oppression of the line

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.820 
in on the oppression of the line
analysis<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:40.760> tree<00:03:41.090> there<00:03:41.740> some<00:03:42.740> college

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
analysis that tree there some college

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.400 
analysis that tree there some college
the<00:03:44.830> sunflower<00:03:45.250> exercise<00:03:46.110> worksheet<00:03:47.110> I've

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
the sunflower exercise worksheet I've

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.540 
the sunflower exercise worksheet I've
definitely<00:03:47.590> been<00:03:47.860> dug<00:03:48.010> back<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.280> my<00:03:48.340> class

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
definitely been dug back to my class

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.400 
definitely been dug back to my class
again<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.480> one<00:03:49.720> where<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.080> students

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
again this is one where the students

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.440 
again this is one where the students
participation<00:03:50.980> dear<00:03:51.460> did<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.730> autograph<00:03:52.210> and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
participation dear did you autograph and

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.150 
participation dear did you autograph and
I<00:03:53.020> guess<00:03:53.170> what's<00:03:53.380> really<00:03:53.590> important<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.040> the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
I guess what's really important is the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.010 
I guess what's really important is the
actual<00:03:54.400> see<00:03:54.550> irrelevance<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.600> exercise

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
actual see irrelevance for the exercise

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.460 
actual see irrelevance for the exercise
can<00:03:56.320> actually<00:03:56.650> relate<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.070> everyday<00:03:57.460> life

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.340 

so<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:02.709> ready<00:04:03.010> next<00:04:03.340> week<00:04:04.050> what<00:04:05.050> does<00:04:05.200> my

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
so now ready next week what does my

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:16.680 
so now ready next week what does my
prabhakar<00:04:05.830> so<00:04:06.310> we<00:04:06.580> say<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.240> x<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.640> y<00:04:15.690> must

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
prabhakar so we say that is x and y must

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.479 
prabhakar so we say that is x and y must
say<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.109> whole<00:04:17.260> teachers<00:04:17.769> participate

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
say on the whole teachers participate

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.659 
say on the whole teachers participate
fully<00:04:19.480> in<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.590> workshops<00:04:21.310> with<00:04:21.489> all

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
fully in the workshops with all

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.909 
fully in the workshops with all
activities<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.570> they<00:04:23.530> put<00:04:23.710> on<00:04:23.800> their

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
activities and they put on their

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.710 
activities and they put on their
students<00:04:24.310> hash<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.730> they<00:04:25.120> experience<00:04:25.660> the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
students hash and they experience the

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.159 
students hash and they experience the
methodologies<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.830> from<00:04:27.790> from<00:04:28.030> being<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.480> the

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
methodologies and from from being in the

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.080 
methodologies and from from being in the
students<00:04:29.740> shoes<00:04:29.980> so<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:30.850> be<00:04:30.910> very

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
students shoes so that can be very

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.270 
students shoes so that can be very
difficult<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:31.990> be<00:04:32.050> very<00:04:32.140> hard<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.919> stop

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
difficult it can be very hard to stop

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.010 
difficult it can be very hard to stop
thinking<00:04:33.700> as<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> teacher<00:04:34.120> what<00:04:34.630> else<00:04:34.810> can<00:04:34.960> you

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
thinking as a teacher what else can you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.790 
thinking as a teacher what else can you
see<00:04:35.470> from<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.800> graph<00:04:36.870> parallel<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.500> what<00:04:38.680> did

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
see from the graph parallel so what did

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.850 
see from the graph parallel so what did
that<00:04:38.950> tell<00:04:39.190> us<00:04:39.310> about<00:04:39.490> their<00:04:39.880> growth<00:04:40.120> rate

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
that tell us about their growth rate

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.909 
that tell us about their growth rate
same<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.190> from<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.880> table<00:04:43.090> we<00:04:43.390> identified

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
same and from the table we identified

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.070 
same and from the table we identified
identified<00:04:44.919> as<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.250> same<00:04:45.490> rate<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.910> change<00:04:46.240> so

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
identified as the same rate of change so

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.320 
identified as the same rate of change so
what<00:04:47.320> should<00:04:48.030> what<00:04:49.030> way<00:04:49.150> would<00:04:49.270> that

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
what should what way would that

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.909 
what should what way would that

connected to the graph rate of change

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.150 
connected to the graph rate of change
would<00:04:51.430> be<00:04:51.460> equivalent<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.530> slope<00:04:53.530> I'm

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
would be equivalent to the slope I'm
