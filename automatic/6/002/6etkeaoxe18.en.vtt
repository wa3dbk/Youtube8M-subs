we can pull on the hair while it's
warming<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> relax<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> curl<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
warming is just to relax the curl so it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.050 
warming is just to relax the curl so it
isn't<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> becoming<00:01:31.680> too<00:01:31.950> too<00:01:32.549> elastic

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
you could really easily recreate this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170 
you could really easily recreate this
yourself<00:02:23.470> because<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.800> only<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.280> hand<00:02:24.520> to

yourself because you only one hand to

yourself because you only one hand to

kind of lit rather than using two now
you'll<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.650> me<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:32.800> very<00:02:33.160> lightly<00:02:33.520> just

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
you'll see me just very lightly just

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.060 
you'll see me just very lightly just
given<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> ends<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.020> fringe<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.560> very

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
given the ends of the fringe a very

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.160 
given the ends of the fringe a very
slight<00:02:36.280> level<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.270> bend<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.080> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
slight level just to bend it in to the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.060 
slight level just to bend it in to the
rest<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> wave<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.560> don't<00:02:41.740> want<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> curl

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
rest of the wave you don't want to curl

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.510 
rest of the wave you don't want to curl
this<00:02:42.190> too<00:02:42.459> much<00:02:42.640> as<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.540> will<00:02:43.630> gonna<00:02:43.840> shrink<00:02:44.110> up

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
this too much as it will gonna shrink up

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.770 
this too much as it will gonna shrink up
so<00:02:45.520> through<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> back<00:02:45.880> I'm<00:02:46.090> only<00:02:46.209> using<00:02:46.420> four

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
so through the back I'm only using four

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.190 
so through the back I'm only using four
sections<00:02:47.170> quite<00:02:47.800> deep<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.930> we're<00:02:50.020> just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
sections quite deep and then we're just

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720 
sections quite deep and then we're just
again<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.980> making<00:02:51.220> sure<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.400> has<00:02:51.550> got<00:02:51.700> a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
again just making sure that has got a

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
again just making sure that has got a
slight<00:02:52.090> bend<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.690> few<00:02:53.140> straight<00:02:53.440> bits<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.770> fine

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
slight bend a few straight bits is fine

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.440 
slight bend a few straight bits is fine
then<00:02:54.580> look<00:02:54.700> we're<00:02:54.820> going<00:02:54.940> for<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> bit

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
then look we're going for it's a bit

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.690 
then look we're going for it's a bit
more<00:02:55.570> relaxed<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.830> again<00:02:57.220> I've<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.370> taken

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
more relaxed and again I've just taken

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.330 
more relaxed and again I've just taken
alternating<00:02:58.510> sections<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.130> left

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
alternating sections so one to the left

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.360 
alternating sections so one to the left
and<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.330> right<00:03:02.040> which<00:03:03.040> we'll<00:03:03.220> see<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and one to the right which we'll see a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.780 
and one to the right which we'll see a
bit<00:03:03.550> more<00:03:03.700> clearly<00:03:03.970> here<00:03:05.580> holding<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.670> one

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
bit more clearly here holding the one

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030 
bit more clearly here holding the one
vertical<00:03:07.330> again<00:03:07.540> will<00:03:07.750> help<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.110> retain<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
vertical again will help you retain the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.979 
vertical again will help you retain the
lens<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.820> won't<00:03:10.030> give<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.300> roost<00:03:10.510> much<00:03:10.750> lift

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
lens it won't give the roost much lift

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.080 
lens it won't give the roost much lift
so<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:11.830> won't<00:03:12.070> lose<00:03:12.340> too<00:03:12.610> much<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so you won't lose too much of the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.199 
so you won't lose too much of the
overall<00:03:13.420> length<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.050> your<00:03:14.140> hair<00:03:14.200> cut<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
overall length of your hair cut and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.520 
overall length of your hair cut and
again<00:03:19.360> you'll<00:03:19.630> see<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.750> rotating<00:03:20.350> action

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
again you'll see that rotating action

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.850 
again you'll see that rotating action
makes<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.070> super<00:03:21.400> easy<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:22.060> curl<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.019> hair<00:03:25.860> in

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
makes it super easy to curl the hair in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.680 
makes it super easy to curl the hair in
quite<00:03:27.070> big<00:03:27.100> sections<00:03:27.519> we<00:03:28.120> don't<00:03:28.299> need<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.510> go

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
quite big sections we don't need to go

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.870 
quite big sections we don't need to go
too<00:03:28.930> small<00:03:29.200> because<00:03:30.160> we're<00:03:30.370> just<00:03:30.489> looking<00:03:30.730> for

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
too small because we're just looking for

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.130 
too small because we're just looking for
texture<00:03:31.239> moving<00:03:31.720> tomorrow<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.290> define<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
texture moving tomorrow then define the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.300 
texture moving tomorrow then define the
last<00:03:38.290> section<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:41.200> higher<00:03:41.410> up<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:41.709> go<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
last section the higher up we go the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.580 
last section the higher up we go the
more<00:03:42.489> roots<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.910> leave<00:03:43.060> out<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.470> mean

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
more roots we leave out so that mean

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
more roots we leave out so that mean
again<00:03:44.830> don't<00:03:45.610> get<00:03:45.820> too<00:03:46.000> much<00:03:46.209> volume<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
again don't get too much volume on the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.630 
again don't get too much volume on the
crown<00:03:49.530> you'll<00:03:50.530> notice<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> slightly<00:03:51.400> rough

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
crown you'll notice a slightly rough

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.630 
crown you'll notice a slightly rough
each<00:03:52.150> section<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.530> towards<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.920> top<00:03:54.190> just

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
each section just towards the top just

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.789 
each section just towards the top just
make<00:03:54.820> sure<00:03:55.030> there's<00:03:55.209> no<00:03:55.360> indentation<00:03:56.260> of

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
make sure there's no indentation of

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.920 
make sure there's no indentation of
where<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.130> straighter<00:03:57.700> hair<00:03:57.910> finishes<00:03:58.480> and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
where the straighter hair finishes and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.990 
where the straighter hair finishes and
the<00:03:59.170> waves<00:03:59.350> begin

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000 

now<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.630> last<00:04:06.810> piece<00:04:06.990> just<00:04:07.560> making<00:04:07.890> sure

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
now the last piece just making sure
