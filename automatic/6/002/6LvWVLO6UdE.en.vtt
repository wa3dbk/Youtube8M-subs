another commentary and this time I'm
doing<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.620> akimbo<00:00:05.009> Rangers<00:00:05.580> now<00:00:06.210> these<00:00:06.420> are

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
doing the akimbo Rangers now these are

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.299 
doing the akimbo Rangers now these are
my<00:00:06.660> old-time<00:00:07.080> flavored<00:00:07.529> shotguns<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
my old-time flavored shotguns in the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
my old-time flavored shotguns in the
game<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.730> think<00:00:09.059> they're<00:00:09.179> tied<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> model

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
game I think they're tied with the model

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.249 
game I think they're tied with the model
1887<00:00:11.370> akimbo<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.210> because<00:00:12.509> they're<00:00:12.690> really

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
1887 akimbo just because they're really

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.840 
1887 akimbo just because they're really
cool<00:00:13.440> animation<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.120> m1014<00:00:16.640> these<00:00:17.640> are

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
cool animation and the m1014 these are

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.640 
cool animation and the m1014 these are
the<00:00:17.940> strongest<00:00:18.390> shotguns<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> game<00:00:19.380> they

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the strongest shotguns in the game they

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.400 
the strongest shotguns in the game they
have<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.980> most<00:00:20.160> damage<00:00:20.670> per<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.180> shot<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
have the most damage per one shot I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.890 
have the most damage per one shot I
guess<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> real<00:00:23.400> skill<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.269> using<00:00:24.810> these

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
guess the real skill and using these

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
guess the real skill and using these
shotguns<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.710> knowing<00:00:26.039> when<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> fire<00:00:26.580> both

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
shotguns is knowing when to fire both

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.529 
shotguns is knowing when to fire both
barrels<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.750> barrel<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.410> four<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:29.539> etc

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
barrels one barrel all four of them etc

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
barrels one barrel all four of them etc
so<00:00:31.500> my<00:00:31.529> class<00:00:31.859> setup<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> marathon<00:00:32.820> pro

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so my class setup is marathon pro

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.729 
so my class setup is marathon pro
lightweight<00:00:33.510> pro<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> steady<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> pro<00:00:34.530> I'm

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
lightweight pro and steady a pro I'm

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
lightweight pro and steady a pro I'm
using<00:00:35.040> marathon<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.700> lightweight<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
using marathon and lightweight so I can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.069 
using marathon and lightweight so I can
run<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.870> forever<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:38.129> fast<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> main

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
run around forever really fast the main

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.180 
run around forever really fast the main
thing<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.070> using

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
thing you want to do when you're using

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
thing you want to do when you're using
shotguns<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.090> close<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> distance<00:00:42.840> between

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
shotguns is close the distance between

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.049 
shotguns is close the distance between
you<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:43.920> opponent<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.579> quickly<00:00:44.850> as

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you and your opponent as quickly as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.770 
you and your opponent as quickly as
possible

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
possible

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
possible
so<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> catch<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> guy<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.640> his<00:00:47.850> spawn

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
so I catch the guy right off his spawn

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
so I catch the guy right off his spawn
here<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.469> he<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.710> trying<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
here I think he was trying to do the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
here I think he was trying to do the
same<00:00:50.520> he<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.820> heading<00:00:51.030> towards<00:00:51.360> me<00:00:51.510> anyways

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
same he was heading towards me anyways

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.639 
same he was heading towards me anyways
steady<00:00:53.010> aim<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.570> blast<00:00:54.899> radius<00:00:55.230> will<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
steady aim so the blast radius will be

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.910 
steady aim so the blast radius will be
more<00:00:55.949> concentrated<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.239> focused<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.739> more

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
more concentrated and focused the more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.529 
more concentrated and focused the more
pellets<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.579> hit<00:00:59.699> your<00:00:59.789> opponent<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pellets that can hit your opponent the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.939 
pellets that can hit your opponent the
quicker<00:01:00.840> they'll<00:01:01.109> die<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> actually

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
quicker they'll die and it actually

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
quicker they'll die and it actually
increases<00:01:02.489> range<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> steady<00:01:03.539> aim<00:01:03.750> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
increases range when you steady aim so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.219 
increases range when you steady aim so
that's<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.970> okay<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.390> tips<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.840> using

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that's good okay so some tips to using

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's good okay so some tips to using
the<00:01:07.320> akimbo<00:01:07.590> Rangers<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.670> far

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the akimbo Rangers when there are at far

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.920 
the akimbo Rangers when there are at far
range<00:01:09.890> fire<00:01:10.890> both<00:01:11.340> barrels<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.720> each

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
range fire both barrels one from each

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
range fire both barrels one from each
shotgun<00:01:13.500> once<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> fire<00:01:15.030> both<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
shotgun once when you fire both at a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
shotgun once when you fire both at a
farther<00:01:16.470> distance<00:01:16.619> that'll<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
farther distance that'll actually well I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
farther distance that'll actually well I
find<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> increases<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> range<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.470> when

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
find it increases the range a bit when

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
find it increases the range a bit when
you're<00:01:20.520> very<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.030> close<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.509> should<00:01:21.659> only

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you're very up close you should only

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.289 
you're very up close you should only
fire<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:23.189> flare<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
fire one I actually flare two just to be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.990 
fire one I actually flare two just to be
safe<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.860> should<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.159> alternate<00:01:26.850> up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
safe and you should also alternate up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.560 
safe and you should also alternate up
close<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.140> me<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:29.009> each<00:01:29.189> side<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.790> right

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
close to for me on each side all right

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
close to for me on each side all right

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
call on my UAV that was I guess it was

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.070 
call on my UAV that was I guess it was
level<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.710> years<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> no<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.340> better

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
level three years and no any better

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.720 
level three years and no any better
not<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.350> sure<00:01:55.650> how<00:01:55.800> he<00:01:55.860> had<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> tactical

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
not really sure how he had a tactical

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.940 
not really sure how he had a tactical
insertion<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.330> level<00:01:57.570> three<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.650> all<00:01:58.770> one

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
insertion at level three you got all one

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.330 
insertion at level three you got all one
of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> default<00:01:59.550> classes<00:01:59.940> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
of the default classes I think has it I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.400 
of the default classes I think has it I
got<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.460> Fred<00:02:02.730> etre<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.600> catch<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:04.020> couple<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
got my Fred etre to catch a couple of

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.470 
got my Fred etre to catch a couple of
boosters<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.190> think<00:02:05.460> reduces<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.420> just

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
boosters I think reduces like I just

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.600 
boosters I think reduces like I just
stopped<00:02:06.930> running<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.620> went<00:02:07.980> for<00:02:08.160> him<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
stopped running so I went for him and I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
stopped running so I went for him and I
got<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.790> double<00:02:09.030> kill<00:02:09.180> so<00:02:09.630> I'm<00:02:09.810> guessing<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.320> was

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
got a double kill so I'm guessing he was

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.900 
got a double kill so I'm guessing he was
with<00:02:10.619> his<00:02:10.770> buddy<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.550> blood<00:02:11.790> or

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
with his buddy here for blood or

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.800 
with his buddy here for blood or
something

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810

was me s medium distance for these
shotguns<00:02:31.960> uh<00:02:32.580> when<00:02:33.580> you're<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.820> close<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.330> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
shotguns uh when you're up close like I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
shotguns uh when you're up close like I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
said fire fan down from the right one

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
said fire fan down from the right one
while<00:02:36.970> one's<00:02:37.210> reloading<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.960> can<00:02:38.110> still<00:02:38.350> fire

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
while one's reloading you can still fire

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.040 
while one's reloading you can still fire
from<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.100> left<00:02:39.340> one<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.450> you'll<00:02:40.600> see<00:02:40.780> me<00:02:40.930> do

from the left one and you'll see me do

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.400 
from the left one and you'll see me do
that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.210 
that
I<00:02:41.440> did<00:02:41.740> yes<00:02:42.460> come<00:02:42.640> included<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.650> I'm<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:44.920> kind

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I did yes come included so I'm just kind

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.400 
I did yes come included so I'm just kind
of<00:02:45.250> running<00:02:45.370> around<00:02:45.610> trying<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.720> find<00:02:46.810> people

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
of running around trying to find people

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.630 
of running around trying to find people
on<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> Harriers<00:02:48.010> they're<00:02:48.190> doing<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
on the Harriers they're doing all the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.880 
on the Harriers they're doing all the
work<00:02:48.820> for<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:50.350> find<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.680> guy<00:02:50.830> right<00:02:51.040> there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
work for me you find a guy right there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.790 
work for me you find a guy right there
moving<00:02:53.890> along<00:02:54.250> pretty<00:02:54.640> quickly<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.620> guess<00:02:56.620> you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
moving along pretty quickly I guess you

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.410 
moving along pretty quickly I guess you
could<00:02:57.070> use<00:02:57.250> me<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:57.610> check<00:02:57.790> row<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.300> your

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
could use me in check row so your

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.449 
could use me in check row so your
footsteps<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.200> would<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.740> silent<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.310> you're

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
footsteps and would be silent and you're

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.250 
footsteps and would be silent and you're
invisible<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.060> heartbeat<00:03:01.390> sensors<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.020> I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
invisible to heartbeat sensors but I

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.020 
invisible to heartbeat sensors but I
just<00:03:02.590> prefer<00:03:02.680> steady<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.490> find<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.880> helped

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
just prefer steady and I find it helped

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.170 
just prefer steady and I find it helped
with<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.270> range<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.750> damage<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:06.060> instead<00:03:07.060> of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
with the range and damage and instead of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.730 
with the range and damage and instead of
light<00:03:07.330> weight<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.690> could<00:03:07.930> substitute<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.709> for

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
light weight you could substitute it for

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.610 
light weight you could substitute it for
stopping<00:03:09.280> power<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:11.170> light<00:03:11.410> weight

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
stopping power but I think light weight

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.440 
stopping power but I think light weight
helps<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.950> lot<00:03:12.130> more<00:03:12.340> with<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> Rangers

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
helps a lot more with the Rangers

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.660 
helps a lot more with the Rangers
especially<00:03:14.050> maybe<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.160> much<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.550> other

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
especially maybe not so much with other

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.880 
especially maybe not so much with other
shotguns<00:03:16.240> especially<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.230> Stryker<00:03:17.590> that

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
shotguns especially not the Stryker that

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880 
shotguns especially not the Stryker that
shotgun<00:03:18.190> needs<00:03:18.670> stopping<00:03:19.180> power<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:20.170> this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
shotgun needs stopping power and this

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.470 
shotgun needs stopping power and this
guy<00:03:21.100> right<00:03:21.280> here<00:03:21.430> he's<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.850> out<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> my<00:03:22.300> reach

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
guy right here he's just out of my reach

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.270 
guy right here he's just out of my reach
until<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.989> get<00:03:23.200> there<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.650> may<00:03:23.800> get<00:03:24.010> killed

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
until I get there and I may get killed

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.420 
until I get there and I may get killed
by<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.550> guy<00:03:24.760> at<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.000> tar<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.010> run<00:03:27.280> around

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
by a guy at the tar so I run around

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.960 
by a guy at the tar so I run around
trying<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.150> intercept<00:03:28.630> him<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.640> waste<00:03:30.640> four

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
trying to intercept him and waste four

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.199 
trying to intercept him and waste four
shots<00:03:31.269> on<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.540> flying<00:03:31.840> dead<00:03:32.080> body<00:03:32.760> get<00:03:33.760> fire<00:03:33.970> two

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
shots on a flying dead body get fire two

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.479 
shots on a flying dead body get fire two
from<00:03:34.480> one<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.870> stole<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.260> other<00:03:35.350> barrel<00:03:35.709> view

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
from one I stole the other barrel view

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.040 
from one I stole the other barrel view
from<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> other<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.060> only<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.600> two<00:03:37.780> shots

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
from the other I only have two shots

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.550 
from the other I only have two shots
left<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:40.720> don't<00:03:40.959> know<00:03:41.050> I'm<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:41.320> kind<00:03:41.470> of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
