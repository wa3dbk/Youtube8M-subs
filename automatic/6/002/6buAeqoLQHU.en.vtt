00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
maker in Minecraft this is a pretty cool

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.240 
maker in Minecraft this is a pretty cool
minecraft<00:00:12.870> invention<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.679> eases<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
minecraft invention that eases the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.250 
minecraft invention that eases the
process<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.910> making<00:00:15.480> high<00:00:15.809> amounts<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
process of making high amounts of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.140 
process of making high amounts of
fireworks<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.670> makes<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> that's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
fireworks and it just makes it that's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.490 
fireworks and it just makes it that's
much<00:00:18.390> easier<00:00:18.420> instead<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.960> having<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.260> sort

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
much easier instead of having to sort

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.810 
much easier instead of having to sort
through<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> million<00:00:19.949> different<00:00:20.189> chess<00:00:20.580> time

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
through a million different chess time

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
through a million different chess time
because<00:00:21.090> fireworks<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:22.080> quite<00:00:22.529> complicated

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
because fireworks are quite complicated

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
because fireworks are quite complicated
in<00:00:23.369> Minecraft<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:24.060> there's<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
in Minecraft there there's a lot of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.080 
in Minecraft there there's a lot of
different<00:00:25.199> stuff<00:00:25.410> happening<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.250> first

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
different stuff happening here and first

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
different stuff happening here and first
of<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:27.269> let<00:00:27.420> me<00:00:27.449> explain<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.410> work<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
of all let me explain how they work so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
of all let me explain how they work so
firework<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> made<00:00:29.789> using<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.689> firework<00:00:31.140> star<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
firework is made using a firework star a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.700 
firework is made using a firework star a
paper<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.630> two<00:00:33.840> three<00:00:34.110> gun<00:00:34.320> powders

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
paper and then one two three gun powders

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
paper and then one two three gun powders
and<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> determines<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.730> height<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and this determines the height so you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.319 
and this determines the height so you
can<00:00:36.390> add<00:00:36.540> extra<00:00:37.020> height<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can add extra height right here so the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.340 
can add extra height right here so the
first<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> you're<00:00:39.870> gonna<00:00:39.930> want<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> do

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
first thing that you're gonna want to do

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
first thing that you're gonna want to do
is<00:00:40.590> make<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:40.980> firework<00:00:41.520> star<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.000> depending

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is make your firework star now depending

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.779 
is make your firework star now depending
on<00:00:42.600> what<00:00:42.870> dies<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.010> modifiers<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
on what dies and the modifiers that you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.299 
on what dies and the modifiers that you
use<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.480> determine<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.950> firework

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
use it will determine how your firework

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
use it will determine how your firework
looks<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.480> first<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
looks like so the first thing that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
looks like so the first thing that
you're<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.829> choose<00:00:50.100> your

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you're gonna want to do is choose your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
you're gonna want to do is choose your
primary<00:00:50.879> color<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.570> colors<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.649> firework

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
primary color or colors now a firework

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.680 
primary color or colors now a firework
can<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.120> colour<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.449> believe

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
can be more than one colour I believe

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.819 
can be more than one colour I believe
it'd<00:00:54.809> give<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> seven<00:00:55.680> different

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it'd give me up to seven different

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.420 
it'd give me up to seven different
depending<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.610> many<00:00:56.670> modifiers<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> have

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
depending on how many modifiers you have

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
depending on how many modifiers you have
so<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.579> I'm<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.910> ahead<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.349 
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is
choose<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.489> choose<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.789> primary

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
choose my I'm gonna choose my primary

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
choose my I'm gonna choose my primary
colors<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> firework

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
colors first this is when the firework

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
colors first this is when the firework
initially<00:01:05.820> blows<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.659> color<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> going

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
initially blows up what color is going

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
initially blows up what color is going
to<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.760> firework

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to be so I'm going to have my firework

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.320 
to be so I'm going to have my firework
be<00:01:09.390> red<00:01:09.799> orange<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> yellow<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.060> sort<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
be red orange and yellow will do sort of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
be red orange and yellow will do sort of
a<00:01:12.450> fiery<00:01:12.750> firework<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.680> that'll<00:01:13.890> look

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a fiery firework I think that'll look

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
a fiery firework I think that'll look
cool<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:15.630> colors

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cool so now that we have those colors

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
cool so now that we have those colors
picked<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.320> we're<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> determine

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
picked out we're gonna want to determine

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
picked out we're gonna want to determine
the<00:01:17.400> height<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.060> default<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.659> gives<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the height so by default it gives you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.859 
the height so by default it gives you
enough<00:01:19.619> gunpowder<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.280> make<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.610> um<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.659> one

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
enough gunpowder to make it um the one

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.270 
enough gunpowder to make it um the one
height<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.680> increase<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
height but if you want to increase it to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.359 
height but if you want to increase it to
two<00:01:23.450> gunpowder's<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:25.200> three<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.280> go

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
two gunpowder's or three then you can go

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.649 
two gunpowder's or three then you can go
ahead<00:01:26.460> flip<00:01:26.700> those<00:01:26.880> switches<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
ahead flip those switches so now this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
ahead flip those switches so now this
will<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> max<00:01:28.259> height<00:01:28.549> then<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
will be the max height then we got to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
will be the max height then we got to
pick<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.659> different<00:01:30.990> modifiers<00:01:31.380> these

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
pick the two different modifiers these

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.310 
pick the two different modifiers these
are<00:01:32.070> optional<00:01:32.579> obviously<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
are optional obviously but we can go

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020 
are optional obviously but we can go
ahead<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> firework<00:01:35.430> creeper

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
ahead and make this firework creeper

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
ahead and make this firework creeper
face<00:01:36.210> shaped<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.810> large<00:01:37.380> ball<00:01:37.710> explosion

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
face shaped a large ball explosion

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880 
face shaped a large ball explosion
star-shaped<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.270> burst<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.770> we're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
star-shaped or burst so I think we're

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
star-shaped or burst so I think we're
gonna<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.189> ahead<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.619> burst

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
gonna go ahead and do a will do burst

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
gonna go ahead and do a will do burst
burst<00:01:44.310> looks<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.880> cool<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
burst looks kind of cool and so then you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
burst looks kind of cool and so then you
got<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> pick<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.680> modifier<00:01:47.189> which<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
got to pick your other modifier which is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.670 
got to pick your other modifier which is
either<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.880> twinkle<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> trail<00:01:49.110> effect<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
either a twinkle or a trail effect I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.960 
either a twinkle or a trail effect I
think<00:01:49.710> we'll<00:01:50.070> go<00:01:50.220> ahead<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> trail

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.749 
think we'll go ahead and do a trail
effect<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.770> now<00:01:52.770> over<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> little

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.240 
effect and now over here is a little
steps<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> crafting<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.219> to

go ahead and trigger the dropper up here

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.990 
go ahead and trigger the dropper up here
but<00:06:43.590> since<00:06:43.740> this<00:06:43.980> guy's<00:06:44.220> already<00:06:44.580> powered

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
but since this guy's already powered

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.090 
but since this guy's already powered
it's<00:06:45.270> not<00:06:45.480> gonna<00:06:45.630> do<00:06:45.810> anything<00:06:46.070> except<00:06:47.070> for

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
it's not gonna do anything except for

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.040 
it's not gonna do anything except for
this<00:06:47.460> guy<00:06:47.610> this<00:06:47.730> guy<00:06:48.030> is<00:06:48.090> going<00:06:48.330> to<00:06:48.510> be<00:06:48.660> on<00:06:48.840> this

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
this guy this guy is going to be on this

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.900 
this guy this guy is going to be on this
guy<00:06:49.200> isn't<00:06:49.470> powered<00:06:49.890> from<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.070> torch<00:06:50.370> so<00:06:50.790> it's

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
guy isn't powered from the torch so it's

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.610 
guy isn't powered from the torch so it's
gonna<00:06:51.030> have<00:06:51.180> a<00:06:51.240> chance<00:06:51.540> to<00:06:51.720> dispense<00:06:52.110> its<00:06:52.320> item

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
gonna have a chance to dispense its item

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.920 
gonna have a chance to dispense its item
and<00:06:52.830> then<00:06:53.430> basically<00:06:53.820> that<00:06:54.150> just<00:06:54.330> makes<00:06:54.720> it<00:06:54.870> so

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
and then basically that just makes it so

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.710 
and then basically that just makes it so
each<00:06:55.380> dropper<00:06:55.950> dispenses<00:06:56.550> it<00:06:56.730> when<00:06:57.480> you<00:06:57.570> have

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
each dropper dispenses it when you have

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.990 
each dropper dispenses it when you have
the<00:06:57.750> item<00:06:58.290> selected<00:06:58.800> so<00:06:59.070> it's<00:06:59.640> some<00:06:59.880> pretty

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
the item selected so it's some pretty

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.210 
the item selected so it's some pretty
simple<00:07:00.300> system<00:07:00.810> here<00:07:00.840> and<00:07:01.230> then<00:07:01.740> I<00:07:01.800> just<00:07:01.980> have

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
simple system here and then I just have

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.850 
simple system here and then I just have
you<00:07:02.400> know<00:07:02.430> a<00:07:02.550> waterway<00:07:03.350> going<00:07:04.350> through<00:07:04.620> here

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
you know a waterway going through here

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.500 
you know a waterway going through here
now<00:07:05.010> I'm<00:07:05.070> not<00:07:05.220> gonna<00:07:05.340> be<00:07:05.550> doing<00:07:05.790> a<00:07:05.880> tutorial<00:07:06.060> on

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
now I'm not gonna be doing a tutorial on

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.320 
now I'm not gonna be doing a tutorial on
this<00:07:06.720> machine<00:07:07.190> simply<00:07:08.190> because<00:07:08.730> it<00:07:08.850> is<00:07:09.030> sort

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
this machine simply because it is sort

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.030 
this machine simply because it is sort
of<00:07:09.390> a<00:07:09.480> ridiculous<00:07:10.050> machine<00:07:10.230> I'm<00:07:10.620> sure<00:07:10.800> not<00:07:10.980> a

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
of a ridiculous machine I'm sure not a

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.620 
of a ridiculous machine I'm sure not a
whole<00:07:11.430> lot<00:07:11.700> of<00:07:11.730> you<00:07:11.880> guys<00:07:12.030> are<00:07:12.210> gonna<00:07:12.270> want<00:07:12.570> to

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
base because it would just be easiest to

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.070 
base because it would just be easiest to
make<00:07:16.770> a<00:07:16.830> chest<00:07:17.190> but<00:07:18.030> again<00:07:18.270> if<00:07:18.480> you<00:07:18.720> guys<00:07:18.840> are

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
pretty easy machine to build because

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.370 
pretty easy machine to build because
it's<00:07:32.640> just<00:07:32.880> you<00:07:33.000> know<00:07:33.150> a<00:07:33.360> block<00:07:33.900> on<00:07:34.140> the<00:07:34.260> back

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
it's just you know a block on the back

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.020 
it's just you know a block on the back
of<00:07:34.560> a<00:07:34.620> block<00:07:34.830> a<00:07:35.010> torch<00:07:35.370> then<00:07:35.760> we<00:07:35.880> have<00:07:36.000> a

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
of a block a torch then we have a

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.750 
of a block a torch then we have a
dropper<00:07:36.540> here<00:07:36.840> with<00:07:37.050> the<00:07:37.140> item<00:07:37.470> in<00:07:37.560> it<00:07:37.680> a<00:07:38.310> torch

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
dropper here with the item in it a torch

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.910 
dropper here with the item in it a torch
beneath<00:07:39.120> it<00:07:39.330> and<00:07:39.510> a<00:07:39.840> redstone<00:07:40.230> line<00:07:40.380> powering

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:40.920 
beneath it and a redstone line powering

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.040 
beneath it and a redstone line powering
them<00:07:41.070> and<00:07:41.310> then<00:07:41.640> just<00:07:41.850> depending<00:07:42.780> on<00:07:42.870> how<00:07:42.990> many

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050 
them and then just depending on how many

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.260 
them and then just depending on how many
ticks<00:07:43.440> you<00:07:43.560> deliver<00:07:43.890> it<00:07:43.980> that<00:07:44.820> will<00:07:44.970> dispense

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.270 
ticks you deliver it that will dispense

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.720 
ticks you deliver it that will dispense
that<00:07:45.480> number<00:07:45.690> of<00:07:45.780> items<00:07:46.140> and<00:07:46.380> yeah<00:07:47.310> that's

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:47.730 
that number of items and yeah that's

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.580 
that number of items and yeah that's
pretty<00:07:47.880> much<00:07:48.000> it<00:07:48.150> so<00:07:48.360> I<00:07:48.750> hope<00:07:49.170> you<00:07:49.380> guys
