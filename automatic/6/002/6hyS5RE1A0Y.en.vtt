00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
multiple scales I guess if Godzilla

didn't say anything about the Muto's but

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.200 
didn't say anything about the Muto's but
if<00:01:58.080> if<00:01:59.080> they<00:01:59.410> release<00:01:59.620> any<00:02:00.220> kind<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.580> toys<00:02:00.850> or

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
if if they release any kind of toys or

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.660 
if if they release any kind of toys or
not<00:02:01.810> necessarily<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.500> public<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.370> sale

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
not necessarily to the public for sale

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.450 
not necessarily to the public for sale
but<00:02:04.540> if<00:02:04.630> they<00:02:04.750> reveal<00:02:05.350> any<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.830> toy<00:02:06.160> or<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
but if they reveal any of the toy or the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.710 
but if they reveal any of the toy or the
action<00:02:06.850> figures<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:08.649> gonna<00:02:08.950> say<00:02:09.369> before<00:02:10.330> that

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
action figures I'm gonna say before that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540 
action figures I'm gonna say before that
happens<00:02:11.500> we'll<00:02:11.860> probably<00:02:12.069> see<00:02:12.340> another

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
happens we'll probably see another

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.580 
happens we'll probably see another
trailer<00:02:12.940> now<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> think<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.930> Super<00:02:14.200> Bowl<00:02:14.379> is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
trailer now I think the Super Bowl is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.220 
trailer now I think the Super Bowl is
probably<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.280> next<00:02:15.430> prime<00:02:15.730> spot<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.360> an

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
probably the next prime spot for an

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.979 
probably the next prime spot for an
additional<00:02:17.739> trailer<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.659> think<00:02:19.870> maybe

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
additional trailer and I think maybe

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.270 
additional trailer and I think maybe
perhaps<00:02:20.230> that's<00:02:20.530> when<00:02:20.709> we'll<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.010> mute

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
perhaps that's when we'll see the mute

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.660 
perhaps that's when we'll see the mute
oh<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:22.269> think<00:02:22.450> Warner<00:02:23.110> Brothers<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:24.459> they

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
oh I don't think Warner Brothers if they

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.690 
oh I don't think Warner Brothers if they
allow<00:02:24.879> these<00:02:25.030> toys<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.659> revealed<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.700> don't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
allow these toys to get revealed I don't

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.790 
allow these toys to get revealed I don't
think<00:02:27.879> they're<00:02:28.000> gonna<00:02:28.090> want<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.629> have<00:02:29.470> people

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
think they're gonna want to have people

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.210 
think they're gonna want to have people
see<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.190> mutilation<00:02:30.730> mute<00:02:31.150> offs<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:32.230> toy<00:02:32.830> form

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
see the mutilation mute offs in toy form

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.680 
see the mutilation mute offs in toy form
before<00:02:33.850> seeing<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.600> big<00:02:34.750> screen

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
before seeing them on the big screen

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.660 
before seeing them on the big screen
so<00:02:35.780> I'm<00:02:36.110> gonna<00:02:36.260> say<00:02:36.620> if<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:37.370> were<00:02:37.430> predicting

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
so I'm gonna say if we were predicting

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.510 
so I'm gonna say if we were predicting
another<00:02:37.970> trailer<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> come<00:02:38.630> out<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:38.840> Godzilla

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
another trailer to come out for Godzilla

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.860 
another trailer to come out for Godzilla
February<00:02:40.520> would<00:02:40.640> make<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.940> most<00:02:41.120> sense<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
February would make the most sense it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.930 
February would make the most sense it
would<00:02:42.050> be<00:02:42.110> almost<00:02:42.440> eight<00:02:42.770> weeks<00:02:43.010> from<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
would be almost eight weeks from the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.370 
would be almost eight weeks from the
time<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.300> released<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:44.960> we<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.110> saw

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
time they released the one we just saw

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.700 
time they released the one we just saw
and<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.450> be<00:02:47.600> roughly<00:02:47.870> three<00:02:48.560> months

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
and that would be roughly three months

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.380 
and that would be roughly three months
before<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.160> release<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.520> movie<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.000> say

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
before the release of the movie so I say

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.540 
before the release of the movie so I say
February<00:02:50.690> would<00:02:51.050> be<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:52.010> next<00:02:52.250> trailer

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
February would be the next trailer

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.950 
February would be the next trailer
rocket<00:02:52.940> right<00:02:53.090> around<00:02:53.210> superbowl<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.870> then

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
rocket right around superbowl and then

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960 
rocket right around superbowl and then
it<00:02:54.110> may<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.350> released<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.860> theaters<00:02:55.190> then

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
it may be released in theaters then

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.310 
it may be released in theaters then
we'll<00:02:56.150> get<00:02:56.300> another<00:02:56.570> probably<00:02:57.560> final<00:02:58.340> trailer

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
we'll get another probably final trailer

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.600 
we'll get another probably final trailer
probably<00:03:00.320> somewhere<00:03:00.620> around<00:03:00.680> April<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.550> month

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
probably somewhere around April a month

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.880 
probably somewhere around April a month
and<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.840> half<00:03:02.870> before<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.470> movie's<00:03:03.860> release

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
and a half before the movie's release

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.290 
and a half before the movie's release
and<00:03:04.370> then<00:03:04.460> that's<00:03:04.700> when<00:03:04.850> you'll<00:03:04.940> start<00:03:05.030> seeing

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
and then that's when you'll start seeing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.580 
and then that's when you'll start seeing
maybe<00:03:05.570> some<00:03:05.780> commercial<00:03:06.230> spots<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:08.030> know

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
maybe some commercial spots so you know

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.310 
maybe some commercial spots so you know
we've<00:03:09.590> got<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.280> much<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.610> dissect<00:03:11.140> since<00:03:12.140> this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
we've got so much to dissect since this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.780 
we've got so much to dissect since this
last<00:03:12.620> trailer<00:03:13.070> as<00:03:13.280> well<00:03:13.580> as<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.420> mute<00:03:14.990> os--

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
last trailer as well as the mute os--

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.760 
last trailer as well as the mute os--
viral<00:03:16.790> website<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.960> really<00:03:18.380> think

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
viral website and and I really think

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.450 
viral website and and I really think
that<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.840> next<00:03:21.080> trailer<00:03:21.320> will<00:03:21.500> be<00:03:21.530> more<00:03:22.070> Mutis

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
that the next trailer will be more Mutis

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.770 
that the next trailer will be more Mutis
than<00:03:22.670> anything<00:03:22.850> else<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.240> think<00:03:23.300> what's<00:03:23.660> gonna

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
than anything else I think what's gonna

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.600 
than anything else I think what's gonna
happen<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.290> they're<00:03:24.920> gonna<00:03:25.010> kick<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.490> the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
happen is they're gonna kick on the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.920 
happen is they're gonna kick on the
viral<00:03:25.970> side<00:03:26.120> again<00:03:26.360> some<00:03:26.570> of<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> keywords

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
viral side again some of the keywords

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
viral side again some of the keywords
we've<00:03:27.350> been<00:03:27.530> typing<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:28.040> will<00:03:28.220> probably<00:03:28.460> start

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
we've been typing in will probably start

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.480 
we've been typing in will probably start
to<00:03:29.090> work<00:03:29.300> start<00:03:30.230> revealing<00:03:30.500> another<00:03:30.770> series

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
to work start revealing another series

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.090 
to work start revealing another series
of<00:03:31.670> videos<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.540> will<00:03:33.110> lead<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.560> trailer

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
of videos that will lead to a trailer

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.070 
of videos that will lead to a trailer
where<00:03:34.310> they're<00:03:34.550> gonna<00:03:34.640> highlight<00:03:35.270> some<00:03:36.050> of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
where they're gonna highlight some of

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.570 
where they're gonna highlight some of
the<00:03:36.200> mute<00:03:36.350> those<00:03:36.530> monsters<00:03:36.950> not<00:03:37.130> maybe<00:03:37.340> see

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
the mute those monsters not maybe see

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.860 
the mute those monsters not maybe see
them<00:03:37.730> in<00:03:37.820> full<00:03:38.030> scale<00:03:38.330> but<00:03:38.570> we'll<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.840> a

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
them in full scale but we'll get a

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.970 
them in full scale but we'll get a
little<00:03:39.170> hint<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.500> them<00:03:39.650> kind<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.890> like

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
little hint of them kind of like

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.540 
little hint of them kind of like
Godzilla<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.810> then<00:03:41.980> we'll<00:03:42.980> probably<00:03:43.190> see<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
Godzilla and then we'll probably see the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.510 
Godzilla and then we'll probably see the
toys<00:03:44.530> might<00:03:45.530> not<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.100> them<00:03:46.280> all<00:03:46.459> of

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
toys might not see it all of them all of

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.620 
toys might not see it all of them all of
them<00:03:46.670> depending<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.180> what<00:03:47.270> they<00:03:47.330> have<00:03:47.450> planned

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
them depending on what they have planned

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.120 
them depending on what they have planned
depending<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.320> on<00:03:48.530> what<00:03:48.560> they<00:03:48.860> want<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.070> show

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
depending on on what they want to show

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.490 
depending on on what they want to show
what<00:03:49.489> they<00:03:49.610> don't<00:03:49.910> want<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.239> show<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.720> think<00:03:51.380> I

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
what they don't want to show I think I

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.270 
what they don't want to show I think I
think<00:03:51.770> they<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:51.920> something<00:03:52.100> up<00:03:52.250> their

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
think they have something up their

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.710 
think they have something up their
sleeve<00:03:52.430> they<00:03:52.790> want<00:03:53.000> they<00:03:53.209> don't<00:03:53.330> want<00:03:53.450> us<00:03:53.690> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
sleeve they want they don't want us to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.250 
sleeve they want they don't want us to
see<00:03:53.989> until<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> movie<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.459> think<00:03:55.790> probably

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
see until the movie but I think probably

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.140 
see until the movie but I think probably
one<00:03:57.370> depending<00:03:58.370> on<00:03:58.459> how<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.760> mute<00:03:58.970> those

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
one depending on how this mute those

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.550 
one depending on how this mute those
things<00:03:59.450> worked<00:03:59.720> out<00:03:59.900> because<00:04:00.020> like<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.500> said

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
things worked out because like I said

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.530 
things worked out because like I said
we've<00:04:00.890> been<00:04:01.040> doing<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:01.489> much<00:04:01.610> speculating<00:04:02.420> on

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
we've been doing so much speculating on

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.930 
we've been doing so much speculating on
the<00:04:02.739> idea<00:04:03.739> of<00:04:03.860> what<00:04:04.040> these<00:04:04.190> monsters<00:04:04.640> are<00:04:04.790> and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
the idea of what these monsters are and

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.430 
the idea of what these monsters are and
what<00:04:05.060> they<00:04:05.180> look<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.840> as<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.140> whether<00:04:06.320> or

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
what they look like and as to whether or

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.210 
what they look like and as to whether or
not<00:04:06.530> they'll<00:04:06.739> have<00:04:06.920> an<00:04:07.040> evolutionary<00:04:09.220> process

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
not they'll have an evolutionary process

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.790 
not they'll have an evolutionary process
they<00:04:10.700> go<00:04:10.850> through<00:04:10.900> perhaps<00:04:11.900> we'll<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.500> some

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
they go through perhaps we'll see some

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.640 
they go through perhaps we'll see some
of<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.950> more<00:04:13.100> common<00:04:13.700> mutants<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.480> then<00:04:15.110> they

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
of the more common mutants and then they

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.979 
of the more common mutants and then they
won't<00:04:15.920> release<00:04:16.070> anything<00:04:16.669> on<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.359> primary

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
won't release anything on the primary

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.750 
won't release anything on the primary
mute<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.320> still<00:04:18.620> later<00:04:18.830> on<00:04:19.070> after<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> movies

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
mute so still later on after the movies

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.450 
mute so still later on after the movies
revealed<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.419> toy<00:04:20.570> will<00:04:20.750> come<00:04:20.900> out<00:04:21.460> but

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
revealed and the toy will come out but

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.480 
revealed and the toy will come out but
like<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.090> said<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:23.330> think<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.960> think<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.710> decent

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
like I said I think I think a decent

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.060 
like I said I think I think a decent
prediction<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.450> feel<00:04:27.290> personally<00:04:27.560> for<00:04:27.950> its

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
prediction I feel personally for its

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.310 
prediction I feel personally for its
timeline<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.700> next<00:04:28.970> trailer<00:04:29.660> will<00:04:30.290> be

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
timeline for the next trailer will be

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.830 
timeline for the next trailer will be
Superbowl<00:04:31.040> if<00:04:31.280> not<00:04:31.550> shortly<00:04:32.030> before<00:04:32.419> shortly

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
Superbowl if not shortly before shortly

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.470 
Superbowl if not shortly before shortly
after<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.440> think<00:04:34.190> it's<00:04:34.310> gonna<00:04:34.400> be<00:04:34.580> mutilated<00:04:35.360> I

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
after I think it's gonna be mutilated I

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.440 
after I think it's gonna be mutilated I
think<00:04:35.660> it's<00:04:35.780> gonna<00:04:35.900> fire<00:04:36.260> up<00:04:36.470> on<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.980> Muto

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
think it's gonna fire up on the Muto

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.020 
think it's gonna fire up on the Muto
research<00:04:38.450> website<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:40.520> then<00:04:40.700> that'll

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
research website and then that'll

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.330 
research website and then that'll
spearhead<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.840> campaign<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.980> continue

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
spearhead the campaign to continue

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.740 
spearhead the campaign to continue
forward<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.760> some<00:04:43.880> a

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
forward and some a

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.440 
forward and some a
you<00:04:45.050> know<00:04:45.170> as<00:04:45.530> long<00:04:46.220> as<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.610> as<00:04:46.910> far<00:04:47.210> as<00:04:47.330> it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
you know as long as it is as far as it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.540 
you know as long as it is as far as it
may<00:04:47.570> seem<00:04:47.630> away<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:49.070> know<00:04:49.160> time<00:04:49.370> goes<00:04:49.400> by

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
may seem away you know time goes by

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.250 
may seem away you know time goes by
pretty<00:04:49.850> fast<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.540> then<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.870> said<00:04:50.930> we<00:04:51.080> have

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
pretty fast and then like I said we have

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.870 
pretty fast and then like I said we have
so<00:04:51.410> many<00:04:51.500> good<00:04:51.680> movies<00:04:51.830> coming<00:04:52.250> coming<00:04:52.670> out

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
next year that I think we have a decent

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.320 
next year that I think we have a decent
amount<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.190> keep<00:04:55.310> us<00:04:55.490> busy<00:04:55.520> but<00:04:55.970> let's<00:04:56.120> face<00:04:56.300> it

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330
