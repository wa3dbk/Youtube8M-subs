00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.869
 you have to use filial flowers

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609

 regarding the subject of the debate 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.459

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.840

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.290
 is made of acrylic paint 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.410
 wooden accessories

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.210
 as commented by tsonga 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 but it will be like that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.950
 of what yes fast 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 parker at the moment that I have to paste the napkin 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.410
 name I do not care about the background color of your suitcase 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.140
 original 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.070
 now you do not remember 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 Applied 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.509
 White glue 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730
 the stick 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.060
 and add a little water to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 what do you want mourinho for now 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050
 how does he see 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
 verona in a joint way a plan 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.870
 applied neither glue 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.870
 in all its surface 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.250
 As you can see, it's a very easy way 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.830
 in which we are going to carry out this work 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.920
 josé millás girls 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.939
 to dare to do things 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.969
 probably the first time you do that job 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 We are not perfect for this festival that here waiting to know that the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.389
 creativity 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.759
 it's a matter of developing it 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.719
 good to what I'm going to do 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.799
 Napkin 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.999
 that here I bring my napkin which I already remove 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.889
 the other one who was carrying regular napkin August 30 but is capable 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.859
 really only beach 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.900
 a tent 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
 and what I will be inhabited 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.749
 thus 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.709
 and only to press a little 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.709
 yes one day if the series is 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.329
 no problem because at the moment 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.570
 this is perfectly fine 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.370
 which millet will attend 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.140
 and who put together in a report 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.259
 this is important 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.669
 DC 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.059
 once I have me and napkin 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.160
 pegadita 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.139
 with the bases 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.329
 Now what you can do is applying some glue 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.349
 on all the surfaces of my napkin 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.939
 thus 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.359
 It is very strong 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.049
 Lavrov called the brush that we use because because the napkin actually 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.429
 It is very soft 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 if we pull hard we can break it 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.269
 in squares but how to repeat them again when being injected 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.499
 in colones in flowers 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.479
 in drawings very a 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.039
 also for the boys 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.489
 here used 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.489
 because what he wants is to give life to my kitchen 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.389
 this circus that we let it dry approximately 24 hours the only thing that 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.029
 they are going to do 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.529
 expose the napkins and back to the back 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:00.559
 just like the central part of this form we break the center we invent 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.209
 into 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.119
 well I will now have shortly ap paint what is the frame can 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.119
 there surface to not stain that is very important 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.230
 because of that 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.290
 the Paraguayan I'm going to paint with an acrylic paint of this color I 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.919
 I chose beatriz pérez to everyone's taste 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.029
 and to the unbeaten east that when they perform any kind of abnormality 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.860
 you are relaxed 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.629
 bad things 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.110
 those express 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.060
 well, sometimes 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.330
 things do not come out 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.380
 it is important that they have all the material to the most serious 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.389
 it's like having at hand 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.629
 kept things do not come out 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.629
 in this way that I am I would like no 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.240
 calm girl 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.270

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.430
 the two tents 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.370
 to our tea base 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.370
 to perfectly cover our godmother 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.330
 here I have 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.349
 what is the back of the inside of the eye 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.629
 in this way as h 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.339
 I used some accessory accessions which 3 4 these 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.340
 accessories are to make bracelets in Colombia really 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.319

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.939
 for the bachelorette parties that are used for the memories and I 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.529
 what I did at this time and in this way 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.639
 and he uses a green background the only thing he did is 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.639
 put a little machine that we had 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.659
 ambac imitates that they already had cotarelo and in promoting 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 it's very easy now what you can do is 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.300
 base 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.009
 unbalanced 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.110
 thus 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.490
 they like girl and use 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.919

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.180

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.699
