00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.580 
ingredient first a whip and we're going
to<00:02:02.659> whip<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.930> up<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.170> going<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.320> be<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
to whip it up it's going to be like a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.190 
to whip it up it's going to be like a
marshmallow<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:05.060> half<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.330> jar<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.869> maple

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
marshmallow so half the jar of maple

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.350 
marshmallow so half the jar of maple
syrup<00:02:06.229> actually<00:02:06.740> no<00:02:07.070> don't<00:02:07.369> dump<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.119> whole

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
syrup actually no don't dump the whole

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.020 
syrup actually no don't dump the whole
thing<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.770> much<00:02:10.190> syrup<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:13.850> just<00:02:13.940> gonna

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
thing in so much syrup so I'm just gonna

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.820 
thing in so much syrup so I'm just gonna
eyeball<00:02:14.300> about<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.900> tablespoons<00:02:15.470> worth<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
eyeball about a tablespoons worth of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.590 
eyeball about a tablespoons worth of
this<00:02:15.980> versatile<00:02:16.310> whipping<00:02:16.640> here<00:02:16.790> what's<00:02:17.360> that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
this versatile whipping here what's that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.580 
this versatile whipping here what's that
going<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:17.989> Richard

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
going to do Richard

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.870 
going to do Richard
so<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> versa<00:02:19.100> whip<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.280> going<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.489> react<00:02:19.790> with

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
so the versa whip is going to react with

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.070 
so the versa whip is going to react with
the<00:02:20.060> maple<00:02:20.360> syrup<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.750> we're<00:02:20.870> going<00:02:21.020> to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the maple syrup and we're going to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.199 
the maple syrup and we're going to
totally<00:02:21.500> manipulate<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> texture<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.760> this

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
totally manipulate the texture of this

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.270 
totally manipulate the texture of this
maple<00:02:23.569> syrup

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 

that's<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.850> changing<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> textures

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that's really changing the textures

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.220 
that's really changing the textures
right<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.650> front<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> my<00:02:32.130> eyes<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:37.020> see
