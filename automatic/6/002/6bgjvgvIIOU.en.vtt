00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
use this for a number of different

00:00:40.179 --> 00:01:19.950 
use this for a number of different
examples<00:00:40.239> here<00:00:41.230> we<00:00:41.289> go

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.459 

the<00:02:49.879> great<00:02:50.030> thing<00:02:50.209> about<00:02:50.239> this<00:02:50.629> sus<00:02:50.930> chord<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
it doesn't have this resolution in it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.000 
it doesn't have this resolution in it
but<00:02:53.659> it<00:02:53.749> does<00:02:53.930> have<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.409> lot<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.829> notes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
but it does have a lot of the notes

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.830 
but it does have a lot of the notes
tying<00:02:55.400> together<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:56.269> we<00:02:56.359> were<00:02:56.450> using<00:02:56.749> before

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
tying together that we were using before

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.379 
tying together that we were using before
it<00:02:57.170> keeps<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.530> f-sharp<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.879> it<00:02:59.030> keeps<00:02:59.239> that

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
it keeps that f-sharp and it keeps that

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.110 
it keeps that f-sharp and it keeps that
a<00:02:59.689> happening<00:03:00.680> throughout<00:03:01.459> quite<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.849> bit<00:03:02.030> of

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
a happening throughout quite a bit of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.610 
a happening throughout quite a bit of
the<00:03:02.239> progression<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:05.170> really<00:03:06.170> dig<00:03:06.349> it<00:03:06.469> because

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the progression I really dig it because

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.170 
the progression I really dig it because
I<00:03:06.709> think<00:03:06.769> it's<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.129> sophisticated<00:03:07.280> sounding

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
I think it's a sophisticated sounding

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.440 
I think it's a sophisticated sounding
turnaround<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.519> kind<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.790> note<00:03:13.969> kind

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
turnaround it's that kind of note kind

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.909 
turnaround it's that kind of note kind
