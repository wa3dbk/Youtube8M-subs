behaviors that a rat would exhibit when

certainly there's no limitation on the

reason of course and that fit with the

interest<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> keeping<00:00:42.510> them<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.079> strongly

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
interest in keeping them I strongly

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.369 
interest in keeping them I strongly
recommend<00:00:44.309> having<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:45.120> least<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:46.140> any

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
recommend having at least two at any

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.240 
recommend having at least two at any
time<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> not<00:00:47.010> keeping<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.610> single<00:00:47.969> rat<00:00:48.149> alone

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
time and not keeping a single rat alone

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.439 
time and not keeping a single rat alone
certainly<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.579> may<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.760> instances<00:00:51.059> where

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
certainly there may be instances where

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.360 
certainly there may be instances where
keeping<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> single<00:00:52.320> rat<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> acceptable<00:00:53.280> but

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
keeping a single rat is acceptable but

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
keeping a single rat is acceptable but
as<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> general<00:00:53.969> rule<00:00:54.110> having<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.379> small

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
as a general rule having them in small

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
as a general rule having them in small
groups<00:00:56.039> having<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.910> family<00:00:57.300> units<00:00:57.559> what

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
groups having them in family units what

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
groups having them in family units what
often<00:00:58.920> works<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> number<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> people<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
often works for a number of people is to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
often works for a number of people is to
set<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.199> call<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> harem<00:01:01.949> where

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
set up what they call a harem where

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.579 
set up what they call a harem where
they'll<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:03.239> male<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.199> lives<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
they'll have one male that lives with a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.429 
they'll have one male that lives with a
group<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.040> two<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.430> females<00:01:06.439> certainly

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
group of two or three females certainly

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
group of two or three females certainly
in<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.680> instance<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.250> male<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
in this instance that male is going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
in this instance that male is going to
have<00:01:09.270> been<00:01:09.479> sterilized<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.290> he<00:01:10.409> can't

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
have been sterilized so he can't

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
have been sterilized so he can't
reproduce<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.780> generally<00:01:13.020> tends<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
reproduce but that generally tends to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
reproduce but that generally tends to
work<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.159> well<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> live<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
work out really well for them to live in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.920 
work out really well for them to live in
groups<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:17.009> cases<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:18.240> isn't<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> big

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
groups in most cases there isn't a big

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
groups in most cases there isn't a big
difference<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.680> whether<00:01:20.009> sexes<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
difference in whether sexes will get

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
difference in whether sexes will get
along<00:01:21.150> although<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> possibility

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
along although there is the possibility

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.550 
along although there is the possibility
that<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:23.250> males<00:01:23.520> may<00:01:23.820> become<00:01:24.150> territorial

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
that two males may become territorial

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
that two males may become territorial
may<00:01:25.560> become<00:01:25.920> argumentative<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.729> actually

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
may become argumentative and actually

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.330 
may become argumentative and actually
fight<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:28.530> instances<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
fight in these instances it's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
fight in these instances it's
recommended<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.420> neutered<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
recommended to have them neutered so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
recommended to have them neutered so
that<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.560> along<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.070> well

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that they can get along really well

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.880 
that they can get along really well
together<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.110> introducing<00:01:34.380> large

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
together and if you're introducing large

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
together and if you're introducing large
numbers<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> rats<00:01:35.820> where<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
numbers of rats where you want to have a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
numbers of rats where you want to have a
large<00:01:37.380> community<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> lived<00:01:38.250> together<00:01:38.460> it's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
large community that lived together it's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
large community that lived together it's
strongly<00:01:39.659> recommended<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
strongly recommended to make sure that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
strongly recommended to make sure that
the<00:01:41.159> animals<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.700> spayed<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:41.939> neutered<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the animals are spayed or neutered so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
the animals are spayed or neutered so
that<00:01:42.600> there's<00:01:42.810> no<00:01:43.020> no<00:01:43.710> accidental<00:01:44.369> breeding

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that there's no no accidental breeding

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.080 
that there's no no accidental breeding
but<00:01:45.840> overall<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.740> important<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> rats

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
but overall it's important for the rats

health and well-being it's important for

health and well-being it's important for

the times that no one is around that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
the times that no one is around that
they're<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.560> left<00:01:52.920> alone<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.149> also

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
they're not just left alone and it also

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
they're not just left alone and it also
allows<00:01:54.750> them<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> groom<00:01:55.380> each<00:01:55.530> other<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.100> play

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
allows them to groom each other to play

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
allows them to groom each other to play
with<00:01:56.520> each<00:01:56.670> other<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.509> exhibit<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.290> the

with each other to exhibit a lot of the
normal<00:01:58.680> behaviors<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.640> rats<00:01:59.880> show<00:02:00.180> with

by themselves alone during the times
you're<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.700> overall<00:02:06.060> it's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you're not there so overall it's
