00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 the motorola moto go yes you could 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 almost say that this device is motorola 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.530
 the existence has saved if you have it 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 times so a bit says says 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 even if everyone is always after 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.949
 Flagship products look the engine 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.279
 Giving was the last two years 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 one of the bestsellers in the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.269
 middle class range around 200 euros 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.099
 and now there is a new generation 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.070
 namely the third generation 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.260
 photo g the third generation we have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.059
 it here and we'll take a look 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.059
 what the whole offers what it looks like 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.289
 Here comes our pretty little one 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.260
 tab box 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.809
 we have already and kindly 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.120
 here is the same by sticker said what 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.000
 here the special features are the moto g 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.500
 the third generation comes from the factory 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.570
 right in the middle version, so to speak 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.610
 In the old days you still have to pay a lot 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.210
 buy extra version that is now 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.799
 right in 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.449
 the camera is significantly improved by 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.360
 at least so instead of resolution 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.600
 before 8 megapixel in the back and two in front 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 are now 13 megapixels and 5 in front 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.929
 there is still a memory card 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.220
 of course that creates one 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.539
 relief for all those now 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.630
 Little frustration had with the high end 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.069
 devices in android camp not something like that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.840
 more a quad core processor is 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.409
 standard of the battery is again one 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.549
 bit stronger 2470 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.830
 milliamperes thats about that 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.819
 100 million and more than the lte 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.860
 version of the second generation and 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.950
 practically the highlight px that means him 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.310
 The thing is waterproof for half 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.300
 hour to water depths of one 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.489
 meter says that the norm pull yes 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:56.019
 Let's get the slide off and we can 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:58.700
 turn on so while that 

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:02.780
 Right here, you can see it android 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.569
 You can hear 51 or it can be seen and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 While on so it is 5 inch displays 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.129
 that's practically the size that is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.200
 at the moment, as a standard 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.230
 has established that is just so with 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 a hand to use is not correct 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.010
 comfortable but quite neat and the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.200
 screen is still nice and big 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.720
 that you can surf or watch videos for 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 a lot has to see then behind 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.980
 you can see that there is such a ripple here 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.780
 plastic surface on the sides 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.540
 here are volume and one and 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 switch and a micro USB socket is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.440
 nothing at all and here you can see pretty well 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.379
 that it's always against the trend 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.689
 the thinner cell phones retains motorola each 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.700
 design with that in the middle is a 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.260
 a little thicker is the whole effect 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 bit more stable and it sure as well 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.420
 more 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.880
 for a battery in here is a sticker 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.070
 I do not know if you can see how 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.020
 All waterproof equipment where to go 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.450
 the back can still open like 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.190
 Here are a few things to consider 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.860
 So here's a note 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.540
 that you have turned it on so here 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.880
 that one should press on it so that he 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.370
 no gaps arise and that can 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 we'll demonstrate once 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.170
 already something solid that also completely 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.170
 Well, that's the envelope interesting one 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 does not see a rubber seal here 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.530
 obviously there is another way 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.090
 to seal that but already here 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.920
 backside looks pretty well shielded 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.340
 and where I so falls just look 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.020
 me a thing a yes the battery 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.400
 you can not change that but that is 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.660
 Almost always so if you look the back 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.170
 You can also lose the battery 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.880
 exchange 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.340
 that is not really a pity here 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 but it probably depends on that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.320
 together that it is waterproof right now 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.709
 is and here at least memory card and 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.630
 a sim card slot for one 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.060
 micro-sim card is practically like that 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.720
 back up and watch that with the 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.380
 software is yes that is practically after 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.670
 as before at android practically pure 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.290
 android with such a few extras 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.720
 By the way, you can see that again here 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.420
 Note that motorola says here again 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.800
 per per man to Display to the 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.280
 Check whether the cover really 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.350
 it is clear that hamburg made and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.000
 Now there are some features that have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.490
 Motorola thinks about you 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.110
 show one of the few apps that 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.020
 additionally installed 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.570
 they call themselves motor and there they are 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.890
 different automations in it and 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.630
 I would like to show something 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.820
 if somebody might do that now 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.490
 light could just turn off then 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.180
 could we demonstrate something and 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.990
 Although protect this now and zack 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.610
 the bags of the train 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.160
 I find that very cool clear 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.440
 flashlights tax liability even at 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.630
 the senior cell phones started it iphone has 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.669
 but now it's that easy 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.100
 I do not even attempt it two 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.580
 shake or chop and do the thing 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.380
 goes to 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.409
 so now you can turn the light on again 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.569
 make bags shake out of it again 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.789
 and there is still a second gesture 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.830
 I also find it very practical has one 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.559
 other manufacturers also ever 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.249
 turn in hand and immediately goes the 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.469
 camera on 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.239
 Who looks exactly he will notice here 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.909
 there is no button for 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:21.569
 trigger and camera button, there are synonymous 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:24.839
 not so you have to trigger differently and 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.349
 although by the tread on the display 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.699
 the focus needs to change to focus 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.289
 activate circle here and then I can 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.439
 push back and forth 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.550
 But then I solve it here on the 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.249
 I have a few more on one side 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.409
 Simple hdr setting is automatic 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.599
 indeed there is good with us 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.129
 thing lightning and the gallery the 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.149
 Just reach if I'm from the right 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.809
 in 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:52.139
 so fischer yes makes a whole 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:54.449
 good impression and a thing is that 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.979
 motto go that 's in several 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.159
 So technically, there are two versions 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.259
 8GB versions with 16GB memory 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.909
 the 16gb version also has more 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.669
 RAM and afterwards there are too 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.779
 a thousand adjustments you can find in the shop 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.009
 Can think about different colors and colors 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.990
 so on that is also a news 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.329
 a small hook at the small 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.229
 version you can see here you know it 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:18.089
 can detect total memory 45 3 gb 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.129
 they are now available in just where 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.800
 I took a few pictures just under 4 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.279
 So gigabyte after unpacking so round 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.409
 4 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.509
 that's damned little then so 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.789
 I would rather the 16 gb version 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.679
 buy but how good the device is now 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.029
 really that is only the first 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:35.029
 fully laboratory test show
