00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
because I mean it's not really bit of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.080

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
split so that's a good way to stretch

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.250 
split so that's a good way to stretch

the<00:02:34.470> basic<00:02:34.860> stretches<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> should<00:02:36.600> do

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the basic stretches that you should do

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.990 
the basic stretches that you should do
before<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.350> tumble<00:02:37.800> or<00:02:38.280> start<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:38.880> do

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
before you like tumble or start or do

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.290 
before you like tumble or start or do
anything<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.940> any<00:02:42.150> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
anything and so before you do any of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.710 
anything and so before you do any of
those<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.170> should<00:02:43.380> probably<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.890> run<00:02:44.820> like

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
those you should probably like run like

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.790 
those you should probably like run like
you're<00:02:45.870> at<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.080> your<00:02:46.110> back<00:02:46.290> yard<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.680> something

or<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.310> jumping<00:02:47.610> jacks<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.230> don't

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
or do jumping jacks because you don't

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.020 
or do jumping jacks because you don't
want<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.560> tear<00:02:49.770> any<00:02:50.040> muscle<00:02:50.430> or<00:02:50.790> pull

want to tear any muscle or pull

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.880 
want to tear any muscle or pull
something<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> summer<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.260> pulled<00:02:52.770> my

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
something like this summer I pulled my

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.280 
something like this summer I pulled my
hamstring<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.730> was<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> most<00:02:54.290> horrible

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
hamstring and it was the most horrible

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.110 
hamstring and it was the most horrible
thing<00:02:55.440> ever

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.900 

so<00:03:00.120> stretch<00:03:00.510> sack<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.320> see<00:03:01.710> like<00:03:02.100> everyone<00:03:02.550> do

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
so stretch sack you see like everyone do

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.330 
so stretch sack you see like everyone do
is<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> bridge<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.590> that's<00:03:04.710> one<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.160> we've

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
is a bridge and that's one that we've

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
is a bridge and that's one that we've
known<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:06.270> forever<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:07.080> sent<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> your

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.760 
known like forever like sent to your
little<00:03:07.770> kid<00:03:07.980> maybe<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.380> some<00:03:10.380> people<00:03:10.650> have

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
little kid maybe and some people have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.930 
little kid maybe and some people have
different<00:03:11.100> ways<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.490> into<00:03:11.700> their

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
different ways of going into their

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.810 
different ways of going into their
bridges<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:13.080> sometimes<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.340> stand<00:03:14.610> up

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
bridges like I sometimes just stand up

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000 
bridges like I sometimes just stand up
and<00:03:15.060> bend<00:03:15.870> backwards<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.530> into<00:03:16.800> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and bend backwards and get into it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.150 
and bend backwards and get into it
rest<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.820> time<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.390> bring<00:03:19.050> one<00:03:19.290> arm<00:03:19.620> over

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
rest in time I just bring one arm over

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.390 
rest in time I just bring one arm over
and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.739> your<00:03:22.770> bridge<00:03:23.130> like

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
and then you can do your bridge like

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.510 
and then you can do your bridge like
really<00:03:23.670> well<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.989> should<00:03:25.320> bring<00:03:26.190> both<00:03:26.489> of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
really well you should bring both of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.840 
really well you should bring both of
your<00:03:26.730> legs<00:03:26.850> together<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:29.070> pull<00:03:29.700> them

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
your legs together then just pull them

your legs together then just pull them
straight<00:03:30.120> back<00:03:30.660> because<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.709> stretches<00:03:32.040> on

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
straight back because it stretches on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.020 
straight back because it stretches on
your<00:03:32.310> shoulders<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:34.140> helps<00:03:34.470> you

your shoulders and that helps you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.310

those<00:04:34.250> are<00:04:34.460> -<00:04:34.700> um<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.680> think<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:37.010> most

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
those are - um I think the most

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.840 
those are - um I think the most
beneficial<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:39.260> other<00:04:39.350> one<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:42.700> one<00:04:43.700> that

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
beneficial and the other one is one that

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.100 
beneficial and the other one is one that
you<00:04:43.970> doing<00:04:44.210> your<00:04:44.330> splits<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.880> can<00:04:47.600> either<00:04:47.840> do

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
you doing your splits you can either do

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.690 
you doing your splits you can either do
try<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.470> do<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.680> by<00:04:48.830> yourself<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:49.490> have

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
try to do this by yourself or have

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.350 
try to do this by yourself or have
someone<00:04:49.990> here<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.020> push<00:04:51.380> your<00:04:51.950> arms<00:04:52.370> back<00:04:52.610> but

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
someone here to push your arms back but

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.380 
someone here to push your arms back but
what<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.690> do<00:04:53.870> is<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:55.000> reach<00:04:56.000> both<00:04:56.180> your

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
what you do is you just reach both your

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.300 
what you do is you just reach both your
arms<00:04:56.540> up<00:04:56.750> in<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.960> air<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.440> then<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:58.040> try<00:04:58.280> to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
arms up in the air and then you try to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.120 
arms up in the air and then you try to
get<00:04:58.580> as<00:04:58.670> far<00:04:58.880> back<00:04:59.150> as<00:04:59.930> you<00:04:59.990> can<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:03.130> that's

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
get as far back as you can and that's

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.310 
get as far back as you can and that's
one<00:05:04.430> that's<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:05.210> think<00:05:05.810> it's<00:05:05.900> really<00:05:06.110> hard

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
one that's I think it's really hard

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.350 
one that's I think it's really hard
probably<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.280> hardest<00:05:07.640> but<00:05:09.850> so<00:05:10.850> those<00:05:11.150> are

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
probably the hardest but so those are

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.530 
probably the hardest but so those are
all<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.950> back<00:05:12.970> stretches<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.150> have<00:05:14.330> for
