here but if you notice that these are
total<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.550> perfectly<00:01:38.910> round<00:01:39.120> they're<00:01:39.450> having

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
total are perfectly round they're having

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.970 
total are perfectly round they're having
to<00:01:39.750> use<00:01:39.870> this<00:01:40.080> watch<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.800> demonstrate

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
to use this watch here to demonstrate

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.860 
to use this watch here to demonstrate
how<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.790> works<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.510> you<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.780> an

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
how that works so you have an

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.410 
how that works so you have an
understanding<00:01:43.050> of<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.770> gears<00:01:44.130> work

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
understanding of how these gears work

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
understanding of how these gears work
let's<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> closer<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:47.250> first<00:01:47.520> thing

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
let's take a closer look the first thing

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
let's take a closer look the first thing
you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.000> notice<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.220> over<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.550> now

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
you want to notice is that over here now

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.220 
you want to notice is that over here now
it's<00:01:51.150> ready<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.660> installed

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
it's ready to be installed

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's ready to be installed
as<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.980> can<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> crystal<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:53.940> got

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
as you can see on the crystal it's got

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.490 
as you can see on the crystal it's got
the<00:01:54.240> sticker<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.630> here<00:01:54.870> and<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.080> need<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.350> take

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the sticker on here and we need to take

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160 
the sticker on here and we need to take
that<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.880> we'll<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.060> use<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> cotton<00:01:57.810> swab

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that off we'll just use a cotton swab

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
that off we'll just use a cotton swab
with<00:01:58.470> some<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.920> these<00:01:59.010> larger<00:01:59.370> ones<00:01:59.550> I<00:01:59.670> keep

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
with some of these larger ones I keep

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.720 
with some of these larger ones I keep
separate<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.630> case<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:01.050> need<00:02:01.230> one<00:02:01.470> if<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> lose

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
separate so in case I need one if I lose

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.940 
separate so in case I need one if I lose
one<00:02:02.760> or<00:02:03.240> sometimes<00:02:03.840> you'll<00:02:04.260> get<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.440> watch<00:02:04.650> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
one or sometimes you'll get a watch to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.250 
one or sometimes you'll get a watch to
repair<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.490> they'll<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.660> end<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
repair and they'll be that the end is

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.130 
repair and they'll be that the end is
concave<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> reason<00:02:09.570> why<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.960> way

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
concave and the reason why it's that way

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
concave and the reason why it's that way
is<00:02:10.350> because<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.040> want<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> outer<00:02:11.580> rim<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
is because you want the outer rim of the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.870 
is because you want the outer rim of the
tool<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.410> press<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.250> jewel<00:02:14.459> setting

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
tool to press on the jewel setting

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.220 
tool to press on the jewel setting
without<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.360> should<00:02:15.540> use<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.959> type<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
without you should use this type of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.479 
without you should use this type of
plier<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.830> where<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.220> flat

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
plier see where it's flat

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.780 
plier see where it's flat
there's<00:02:18.060> no<00:02:18.920> serrated<00:02:19.920> edges<00:02:20.220> there<00:02:20.520> like

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
there's no serrated edges there like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.449 
there's no serrated edges there like
this<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.200> want<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
this one because you don't want to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.280 
this one because you don't want to
destroy<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.640> T<00:02:23.820> end<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.630> use<00:02:24.840> these<00:02:25.020> type<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
destroy the T end so use these type of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
destroy the T end so use these type of
pliers<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:25.830> wheels<00:02:26.070> make<00:02:26.790> sure<00:02:26.910> there's<00:02:27.150> no

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
pliers or wheels make sure there's no

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.449 
pliers or wheels make sure there's no
dirt<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.810> need<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.320> get<00:02:28.560> some<00:02:28.709> magnification

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
dirt you need to get some magnification

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.520 
dirt you need to get some magnification
and<00:02:29.580> examine<00:02:30.000> them<00:02:30.120> closely<00:02:30.380> then<00:02:31.380> you'll

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and examine them closely then you'll

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.229 
and examine them closely then you'll
need<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.890> some<00:02:32.130> pith<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.580> buttons<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
need to get some pith with buttons and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.940 
need to get some pith with buttons and
here's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> pith<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.870> button<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
here's a pith with button here and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.380 
here's a pith with button here and
before<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.370> put<00:02:35.520> these<00:02:35.670> pieces<00:02:35.910> together<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
before we put these pieces together we

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.600 
before we put these pieces together we
need<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.570> put<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> little<00:02:36.840> bit<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.110> oil<00:02:37.320> between

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
need to put a little bit of oil between

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
drop of oil right there that's plenty so

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.819 
drop of oil right there that's plenty so
that<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.599> have<00:02:49.719> changed<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.349> effective

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
that we have changed the effective

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.849 
that we have changed the effective
