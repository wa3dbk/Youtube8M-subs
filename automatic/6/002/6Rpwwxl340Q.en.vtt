00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240 
and he is a incredibly personality he's
very<00:02:12.640> smart<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> very<00:02:13.510> kind<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.590> quirky<00:02:14.860> horse

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
very smart and very kind of quirky horse

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
very smart and very kind of quirky horse
so<00:02:15.730> he's<00:02:16.269> been<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> lot<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.140> fun<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.739> know

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so he's been a lot of fun to get to know

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.000 
so he's been a lot of fun to get to know
and<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.670> build<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.269> relationship<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.440> so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and to build a relationship with and so

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.619 
and to build a relationship with and so
I<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:21.849> good<00:02:22.030> bond<00:02:22.269> and

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
I think we have a really good bond and

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.100 
I think we have a really good bond and
and<00:02:23.790> hopefully<00:02:24.790> my<00:02:25.180> black<00:02:25.420> dragon<00:02:25.930> I've

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and hopefully my black dragon I've

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.059 
and hopefully my black dragon I've
trained<00:02:26.650> him<00:02:26.830> well

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
trained him well

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.070 
trained him well
so<00:02:27.400> hopefully<00:02:27.780> he<00:02:29.310> stays<00:02:30.310> within<00:02:30.519> his<00:02:30.790> realm

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.660 

when<00:02:35.080> she<00:02:35.200> was<00:02:35.319> born<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.830> knew<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.129> knew<00:02:36.430> she

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
when she was born I knew I knew she

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.900 
when she was born I knew I knew she
would<00:02:36.819> be<00:02:36.849> becoming<00:02:37.660> here<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.110> we<00:02:38.410> came<00:02:38.620> here

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
would be becoming here we we came here

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.100 
would be becoming here we we came here
probably<00:02:39.910> when<00:02:40.060> she<00:02:40.299> was<00:02:40.420> about<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> four<00:02:40.959> year

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
probably when she was about a four year

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.350 
probably when she was about a four year
old<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.519> Susan<00:02:42.519> Wainwright<00:02:42.880> had<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.120> horse

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
old and Susan Wainwright had a horse

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
old and Susan Wainwright had a horse
competing<00:02:43.959> here<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.290> that's<00:02:44.440> when<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.769> wasn't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
competing here and that's when it wasn't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.500 
competing here and that's when it wasn't
I<00:02:45.280> believe<00:02:45.660> still<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.829> start<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.340> point<00:02:48.700> it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
I believe still to start that point it

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.479 
I believe still to start that point it
was<00:02:49.630> years<00:02:50.019> ago<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.500> she<00:02:50.709> held<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> horse

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
was years ago and she held that horse

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.190 
was years ago and she held that horse
and<00:02:51.849> we<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> picture<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.720> her<00:02:52.810> holding<00:02:52.930> a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and we have a picture of her holding a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.550 
and we have a picture of her holding a
horse<00:02:53.799> out<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.640> Rolex<00:02:55.030> signs<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
horse out with Rolex signs and and you

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.589 
horse out with Rolex signs and and you
know<00:02:56.680> she's<00:02:56.980> coming<00:02:57.190> she's<00:02:57.489> grown<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.269> in<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
know she's coming she's grown up in this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.990 
know she's coming she's grown up in this
world<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.290> she<00:02:59.590> has<00:02:59.920> always<00:03:00.099> put<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.519> as<00:03:00.760> as

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
world and she has always put this as as

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.140 
world and she has always put this as as
her<00:03:01.750> first<00:03:02.140> step<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.829> really<00:03:03.099> coming<00:03:03.579> into<00:03:03.849> it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
her first step of really coming into it

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.809 
her first step of really coming into it
and<00:03:04.360> she<00:03:05.049> has<00:03:05.140> done<00:03:05.260> her<00:03:05.440> homework<00:03:05.650> she's<00:03:06.430> put

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
and she has done her homework she's put

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.110 
and she has done her homework she's put
in<00:03:06.940> her<00:03:07.150> time<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.680> think<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.340> think

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
in her time and I think I think I think

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.699 
in her time and I think I think I think
she<00:03:10.660> would<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:10.900> been<00:03:10.989> here<00:03:11.170> earlier<00:03:11.290> it's

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
she would have been here earlier it's

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.379 
she would have been here earlier it's
just<00:03:11.829> unfortunately<00:03:12.730> things<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.209> happened

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
just unfortunately things have happened

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.300 
just unfortunately things have happened
that<00:03:13.750> got<00:03:13.989> in<00:03:14.170> her<00:03:14.260> way<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.769> she<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:14.950> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
that got in her way and here she is and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.120 
that got in her way and here she is and
I<00:03:15.400> think<00:03:15.609> she's<00:03:15.760> ready<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.090> prove<00:03:16.720> herself

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
I think she's ready to prove herself

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.289 
I think she's ready to prove herself
which<00:03:18.130> she<00:03:18.160> doesn't<00:03:18.609> really<00:03:18.700> need<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.030> do<00:03:19.180> I

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
which she doesn't really need to do I

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.059 
which she doesn't really need to do I
mean<00:03:19.450> obviously<00:03:19.600> when<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> wild<00:03:20.859> one<00:03:21.040> and

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
mean obviously when I get a wild one and

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.849 
mean obviously when I get a wild one and
there's<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.489> lot<00:03:21.760> more<00:03:21.970> time<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:23.230> has<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.709> be

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
there's a lot more time that has to be

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.629 
there's a lot more time that has to be
put<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.970> make<00:03:25.150> sure<00:03:25.180> they're<00:03:25.780> safe<00:03:26.049> and

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
put in to make sure they're safe and

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.759 
put in to make sure they're safe and
especially<00:03:27.639> when<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.359> have<00:03:28.750> horses<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.620> are

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
especially when I have horses that are

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.009 
especially when I have horses that are
ambassadors<00:03:30.579> for<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.880> breed<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.329> need<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.870> make

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019
