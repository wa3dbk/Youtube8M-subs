into like high school is mainly because
of<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.269> beginning<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.720> book<00:03:17.810> she<00:03:17.870> talks

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
of the beginning of the book she talks

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.410 
of the beginning of the book she talks
about<00:03:18.350> how<00:03:18.920> she<00:03:18.950> doesn't<00:03:19.459> belong<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.120> I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
about how she doesn't belong and I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.610 
about how she doesn't belong and I
definitely<00:03:20.600> could<00:03:20.900> relate<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.560> because

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
definitely could relate to that because

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.560 
definitely could relate to that because
I<00:03:22.040> didn't<00:03:22.250> necessarily<00:03:22.310> belong<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.239> certain
