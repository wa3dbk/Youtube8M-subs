00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the heated seats you just press the clip

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.300 
the heated seats you just press the clip
and<00:01:12.090> it'll<00:01:12.390> come<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.580> also<00:01:16.310> cigarette

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lighter you have to press on this clip

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
lighter you have to press on this clip
and<00:01:20.880> I'll<00:01:21.030> also<00:01:21.240> come<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.500> might<00:01:22.740> separate

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and I'll also come off it might separate

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789 
and I'll also come off it might separate
the<00:01:24.210> heated<00:01:24.630> switches<00:01:25.049> might<00:01:25.229> separate<00:01:25.650> they

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the heated switches might separate they

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.390 
the heated switches might separate they
come<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.690> just<00:01:27.690> like<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.650> something

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
come off just like that so if something

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.649 
come off just like that so if something
like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.549> happens<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.119> push<00:01:30.479> them

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
like that happens you just push them

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.859 
like that happens you just push them
back<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.080> that's<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> next<00:01:33.330> step<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
back and that's it so the next step is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.289 
back and that's it so the next step is
underneath<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.760> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> see

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
underneath here you're going to see

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.719 
underneath here you're going to see
there's<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:38.360> there's<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.630> bolt<00:01:39.900> right<00:01:40.200> here

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
there's a there's one bolt right here

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.530 
there's a there's one bolt right here
and<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:41.970> another<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.750> here

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
and there's another one right here

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
and there's another one right here
those<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:45.960> Phillips<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.310> you're

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
those look like Phillips but if you're

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.859 
those look like Phillips but if you're
going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> small<00:01:48.509> phillips

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
going to use a small phillips

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.210 
going to use a small phillips
screwdriver<00:01:49.080> you're<00:01:49.470> most<00:01:49.650> likely<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
screwdriver you're most likely going to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850 
screwdriver you're most likely going to
strip<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.600> why<00:01:51.869> we're<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
strip them so that's why we're going to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
strip them so that's why we're going to
use<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.369> small<00:01:54.000> ratchet<00:01:54.330> with<00:01:54.900> 8<00:01:55.170> millimeter

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
use this small ratchet with 8 millimeter

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
use this small ratchet with 8 millimeter
socket<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.130> we're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.820> ahead<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
socket and we're going to go ahead and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
socket and we're going to go ahead and
remove<00:01:57.540> those<00:01:57.720> two<00:01:58.110> bolts<00:01:58.290> right<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.579> we

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
remove those two bolts right now so we

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520 
remove those two bolts right now so we
just<00:01:59.700> remove<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> two<00:02:00.570> bolts<00:02:00.780> underneath<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
just remove the two bolts underneath the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.280 
just remove the two bolts underneath the
radio<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.159> good<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.939> look<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
radio so good so they look like that now

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
radio so good so they look like that now
like<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.590> said<00:02:04.890> don't<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.549> Phillips<00:02:06.329> screw

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
like I said don't use Phillips screw

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
like I said don't use Phillips screw
driver<00:02:06.619> on<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:07.979> most<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.970> you're

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
driver on them because most like you're

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.570 
driver on them because most like you're
going<00:02:09.299> to<00:02:09.360> strip<00:02:09.599> them<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:11.069> use<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> eight

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
going to strip them just use the eight

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.360 
going to strip them just use the eight
millimeter<00:02:11.970> socket<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.530> next<00:02:13.739> step<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
millimeter socket so the next step is to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.040 
millimeter socket so the next step is to
remove<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
remove the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.340 
remove the
and<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:17.180> gonna<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> little<00:02:17.900> harder<00:02:18.320> for

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
and it's gonna be a little harder for

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.740 
and it's gonna be a little harder for
you<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.850> push<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.360> from<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you but you have to push it from the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.320 
you but you have to push it from the
back<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.670> when<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:25.400> gonna

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
back and when you do that it's gonna

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.390 
back and when you do that it's gonna
come<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:26.660> but<00:02:27.050> if<00:02:27.230> yours<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.710> not<00:02:27.740> coming<00:02:28.280> up

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
come off but if yours is not coming up

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.500 
come off but if yours is not coming up
this<00:02:28.610> easy<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:29.990> go<00:02:30.140> ahead<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.710> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
this easy you can just go ahead with the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.150 
this easy you can just go ahead with the
with<00:02:32.510> your<00:02:32.660> clip<00:02:33.260> removal<00:02:33.650> tool<00:02:33.890> or<00:02:34.070> your

with your clip removal tool or your

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.800 
with your clip removal tool or your
flathead<00:02:34.640> screwdriver<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.240> just<00:02:35.390> work<00:02:35.780> your

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
flathead screwdriver and just work your

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.840 
flathead screwdriver and just work your
way<00:02:35.990> around<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:37.010> going<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> show<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.580> where

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
way around I'm going to show you where

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.540 
way around I'm going to show you where
the<00:02:37.970> clips<00:02:38.240> are<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.770> once<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.130> remove<00:02:40.400> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
start for one place you just work your

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.310 
start for one place you just work your
way<00:03:00.620> around<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.810> once<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.900> remove<00:03:03.020> the

way around it and once you remove the
radio<00:03:03.820> you're<00:03:04.820> going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.060> see<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.450> open<00:03:06.320> port

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
radio you're going to see this open port

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.430 
radio you're going to see this open port
right<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.810> where<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.020> kit<00:03:09.290> is

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
right here so this is where I kit is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.500 
right here so this is where I kit is
going<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.710> plug<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.510> if<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.720> haven't<00:03:13.510> if

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
going to plug in so if you haven't if

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.690 
going to plug in so if you haven't if
you<00:03:14.720> if<00:03:15.020> your<00:03:15.230> stereo<00:03:15.830> looks<00:03:16.130> like<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.490> one

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the kit will work if you have a built-in

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.670 
the kit will work if you have a built-in
six<00:03:19.670> disc<00:03:19.940> changer<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:21.110> there

there's no port like that at the back of
the<00:03:24.380> radio<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.830> our<00:03:24.950> solution<00:03:25.459> will<00:03:25.580> not<00:03:25.640> work

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
