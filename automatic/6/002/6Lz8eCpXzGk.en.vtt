low whatever the case may be let's take
a<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.880> another<00:01:12.000> example<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> are

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
a look at another example so here we are

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
a look at another example so here we are
on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> map<00:01:14.130> carrier<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> let's<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
on the map carrier and let's say you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
on the map carrier and let's say you
just<00:01:15.570> spawned<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.290> after<00:01:16.619> dying<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
just spawned back in after dying and you
need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> B<00:01:17.909> flag<00:01:18.330> fast<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.170> run

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
need to get to the B flag fast you run

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
need to get to the B flag fast you run
up<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> middle<00:01:19.890> alleyway<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> nice

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
up this middle alleyway you get a nice

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
up this middle alleyway you get a nice
line<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.570> sight<00:01:21.750> down<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.409> flag<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
line of sight down the be flag and you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
line of sight down the be flag and you
taking<00:01:23.790> people<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> turns<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
taking people out but it turns out this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.830 
taking people out but it turns out this
