throughout the rest of the program they

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.510 
throughout the rest of the program they
continue<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.570> build<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.200> our<00:01:09.830> students

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
continue to build on that our students

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.359

Ohio<00:01:19.940> once<00:01:20.600> we<00:01:20.750> get<00:01:21.020> into<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.380> clinical

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
Ohio once we get into the clinical

Ohio once we get into the clinical
setting<00:01:22.070> we're<00:01:22.310> working<00:01:22.580> with<00:01:22.670> other

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
setting we're working with other

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.150 
setting we're working with other
departments<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.510> daily<00:01:23.720> basis<00:01:24.260> really<00:01:25.010> on<00:01:25.130> a

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
departments on a daily basis really on a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.100 
departments on a daily basis really on a
patient<00:01:25.550> by<00:01:25.640> patient<00:01:25.670> basis<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.020> think

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
patient by patient basis and so I think

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.450 
patient by patient basis and so I think
it's<00:01:27.290> critical<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.770> we<00:01:27.890> learn<00:01:28.070> how<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.310> do

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
it's critical that we learn how to do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.490 
it's critical that we learn how to do
that<00:01:28.580> early<00:01:28.940> on<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.330> one<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.050> ways<00:01:30.080> that's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
that early on and one of the ways that's

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.499 
that early on and one of the ways that's
been<00:01:30.710> unique<00:01:31.009> for<00:01:31.250> me<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.640> our<00:01:31.940> program

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
case and see how each department would

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.150 
case and see how each department would
help<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.660> help<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.500> patient<00:01:48.649> through<00:01:49.039> their

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
time in the hospital and so that's been

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.570 
time in the hospital and so that's been
unique<00:01:51.170> when<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.619> enter<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.979> program<00:01:52.220> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.969 
through the program I'm only in my
second<00:01:59.780> semester<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:00.350> already<00:02:00.590> seeing<00:02:00.860> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
second semester and I'm already seeing a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.160 
second semester and I'm already seeing a
huge<00:02:01.160> difference<00:02:01.479> from<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.539> beginning<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
huge difference from the beginning to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.809 
huge difference from the beginning to
now<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.619> have<00:02:03.860> no<00:02:04.069> doubt<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.490> at<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> end

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
now so I have no doubt that at the end

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.740 
now so I have no doubt that at the end
of<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.940> program<00:02:05.090> i'll<00:02:05.420> feel<00:02:05.569> very
