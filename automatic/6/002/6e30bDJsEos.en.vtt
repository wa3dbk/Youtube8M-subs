00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
umber 5 do you use the star rating

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
umber 5 do you use the star rating
system<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> star

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
system I do but I don't like the star

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.510 
system I do but I don't like the star
rating<00:01:54.540> system<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.170> still<00:01:55.619> use<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> don't

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
rating system I still use it but I don't

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
rating system I still use it but I don't
like<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> wish<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.110> give<00:01:58.259> us

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
like it I wish that they would give us

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.649 
like it I wish that they would give us
something<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.740> half<00:01:59.130> stars<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.880> even<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
something like half stars or even just a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
something like half stars or even just a
percentage<00:02:01.320> rating<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.189> would

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
percentage rating I think that would

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
percentage rating I think that would
just<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.670> rating<00:02:03.090> books<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.930> much<00:02:04.200> easier

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
just make rating books so much easier

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
just make rating books so much easier
but<00:02:05.070> no<00:02:05.250> Goodreads<00:02:05.939> has<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.270> annoying<00:02:06.540> and

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
I don't even really

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.430 
I don't even really
care<00:06:32.850> that<00:06:33.030> much<00:06:33.180> about<00:06:33.240> all<00:06:33.690> those<00:06:33.900> things<00:06:34.200> on

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
that list but those are just some things

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.130 
that list but those are just some things
that<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.120> think<00:06:36.210> that<00:06:36.360> they<00:06:36.510> could<00:06:36.570> improve<00:06:36.960> on

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140
