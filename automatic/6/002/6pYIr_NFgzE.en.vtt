00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.110> simulating<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.770> power<00:00:01.979> outage<00:00:02.250> right

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay I'm simulating a power outage right

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.050 
okay I'm simulating a power outage right
now<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.090> obviously<00:00:04.100> you<00:00:05.100> get<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.250> back<00:00:05.520> siphon

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
now and obviously you get a back siphon

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.870 
now and obviously you get a back siphon
from<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.540> return<00:00:06.839> pump<00:00:07.140> if<00:00:07.950> it's<00:00:08.189> beneath<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
from the return pump if it's beneath the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
from the return pump if it's beneath the
water<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.110> that's<00:00:10.290> why<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> drilled<00:00:10.830> this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
water and that's why I drilled this

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
water and that's why I drilled this
little<00:00:11.190> hole<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> once<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.610> gets<00:00:14.730> below

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
little hole here so once it gets below

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
little hole here so once it gets below
that<00:00:15.269> level<00:00:15.480> that's<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.470> breaks<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.920> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that level that's like an breaks in it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
that level that's like an breaks in it
doesn't<00:00:17.160> overflow<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.539> sum<00:00:20.359> in<00:00:21.359> there

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
doesn't overflow into your sum in there

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
doesn't overflow into your sum in there
from<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.230> alone<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:23.850> water

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
from that alone but there's water

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.880 
from that alone but there's water
everywhere<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> floor<00:00:25.019> because<00:00:25.380> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
everywhere on the floor because it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.540 
everywhere on the floor because it's
raining<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:28.619> never<00:00:28.800> rains<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.189> Arizona

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
raining and it never rains in Arizona

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
raining and it never rains in Arizona
only<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> try<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.539> stuff<00:00:32.270> but<00:00:33.270> I'm

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
only when I try to do stuff but I'm

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.630 
only when I try to do stuff but I'm
gonna<00:00:34.230> turn<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> power<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> minute

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
gonna turn the power back on a minute

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
gonna turn the power back on a minute
the<00:00:35.730> seat<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.210> my<00:00:37.050> pike<00:00:37.320> kept<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> siphoned<00:00:38.960> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the seat if my pike kept it siphoned and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
the seat if my pike kept it siphoned and
let's<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> now

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
let's do that now

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
let's do that now
I<00:00:42.079> have<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> pump<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:44.040> set<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.489> now

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I have the pump actually set right now

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
I have the pump actually set right now
at<00:00:45.289> 1,000<00:00:46.289> gallons<00:00:46.620> per<00:00:46.829> hour

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
at 1,000 gallons per hour

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.810 
at 1,000 gallons per hour
I'm<00:00:47.760> sure<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.719> losing<00:00:49.260> something<00:00:49.640> because<00:00:50.640> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I'm sure I'm losing something because it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
I'm sure I'm losing something because it
goes<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
goes up a little bit but I don't think

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
goes up a little bit but I don't think
I'm<00:00:53.100> losing<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.520> much<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.910> pump<00:00:54.180> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I'm losing all that much this pump is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
I'm losing all that much this pump is
really<00:00:54.510> working<00:00:54.989> well<00:00:58.370> just<00:00:59.370> turned<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> back

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really working well just turned it back

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.170 
really working well just turned it back
on<00:01:00.710> let's<00:01:01.710> watch<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> water<00:01:02.399> level<00:01:02.760> rise<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
on let's watch the water level rise it's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.130 
on let's watch the water level rise it's
already<00:01:03.420> above<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.030> hole<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> drove<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
already above just the hole I drove in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
already above just the hole I drove in
the<00:01:07.260> return

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.490 

let's<00:01:12.600> focus<00:01:12.870> on<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:14.660> overflow<00:01:15.660> right<00:01:16.320> now

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
let's focus on the overflow right now

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:46.719 
let's focus on the overflow right now
and<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.040> happens

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.060 

it<00:01:47.180> looks<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.630> be<00:01:47.659> working<00:01:48.460> perfect<00:01:49.460> right<00:01:49.670> now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
it looks to be working perfect right now

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.849 
it looks to be working perfect right now
very<00:01:52.070> strong<00:01:52.219> place

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.819 

have<00:01:57.859> not<00:01:58.189> completed<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:59.409> just<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> hole

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
have not completed I just have a hole

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.529 
have not completed I just have a hole
cut<00:02:00.979> out<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.280> top<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:02.030> don't<00:02:02.750> have<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:03.020> giftie

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
cut out and top I don't have to giftie

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.699 
cut out and top I don't have to giftie
plunges<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:06.049> have<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.380> buy<00:02:06.530> owe<00:02:06.560> me

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.929 

I<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.579> be<00:02:14.700> working<00:02:15.230> perfectly<00:02:16.230> fine

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.220 

water<00:02:20.939> level<00:02:21.299> has<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.659> risen

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
water level has not risen

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.320 
water level has not risen
there's<00:02:22.379> risen<00:02:22.920> above

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.600 

the<00:02:27.600> pipeline<00:02:29.090> Catholic<00:02:30.090> faith<00:02:30.330> farewell

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:03:14.020 

we<00:02:34.940> say<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.210> can<00:02:35.450> pee<00:02:35.720> again

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.060 

and<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.900> tell<00:03:14.960> water<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.530> starting<00:03:15.890> to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and as you can tell water is starting to

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.930 
and as you can tell water is starting to
go<00:03:16.280> back<00:03:16.550> into<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.970> sump<00:03:17.270> because<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.260> has<00:03:18.440> not

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
go back into the sump because it has not

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:37.449 
go back into the sump because it has not
broken<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.180> siphon<00:03:20.570> yet<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.860> return

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:04:23.350 

and<00:03:38.000> let's<00:03:38.390> put<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.599> power<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:38.930> one<00:03:39.170> more<00:03:39.349> time

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.270 

and<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.900> just<00:04:24.050> got<00:04:24.259> a<00:04:24.319> little<00:04:24.439> noisy<00:04:24.949> right<00:04:25.099> now

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
and it just got a little noisy right now

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.540 
and it just got a little noisy right now
however<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.819> do<00:04:25.909> not<00:04:26.180> have<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.629> silencer<00:04:27.259> on

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
however I do not have the silencer on

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.089 
however I do not have the silencer on
also<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.990> water<00:04:30.229> is<00:04:30.379> a<00:04:30.409> straight<00:04:30.740> up<00:04:30.770> fitting

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
also the water is a straight up fitting

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:45.270 
also the water is a straight up fitting
into<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:32.240> um<00:04:32.509> instead<00:04:33.289> of<00:04:33.530> going<00:04:33.860> to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:55.539 

probably<00:04:46.280> really<00:04:52.120> thanks<00:04:53.120> for<00:04:53.240> watching
