coming<00:03:06.430> we<00:03:06.549> aren't<00:03:06.790> not<00:03:07.000> exactly<00:03:07.540> sure

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
coming we aren't not exactly sure

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.930 
coming we aren't not exactly sure
PlayStation<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.010> probably<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.489> tell<00:03:09.790> us

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
PlayStation will probably not tell us

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.509 
PlayStation will probably not tell us
either<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.959> gaming<00:03:11.379> projects<00:03:11.859> where<00:03:12.129> the<00:03:12.250> ps4

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
either but gaming projects where the ps4

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.000 
either but gaming projects where the ps4
have<00:03:13.329> begun<00:03:13.690> throughout<00:03:14.049> various<00:03:14.260> companies

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
have begun throughout various companies

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.500 
have begun throughout various companies
so<00:03:15.400> basically<00:03:15.910> companies<00:03:16.299> have<00:03:16.480> started

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
so basically companies have started

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.080 
so basically companies have started
making<00:03:17.139> games<00:03:17.440> for<00:03:17.590> them<00:03:17.919> and<00:03:18.130> formatting

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
games for the ps4 so that could mean

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.690 
games for the ps4 so that could mean
that<00:03:22.540> ps4<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.620> coming<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.040> we<00:03:24.190> aren't<00:03:24.340> exactly

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.059 
any earlier than 2014 mainly because
Vita<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:37.000> coming<00:03:37.630> out<00:03:37.750> next<00:03:37.930> year<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:38.799> could

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
Vita is coming out next year so could

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.830 
Vita is coming out next year so could
delay<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.370> launch<00:03:39.669> maybe<00:03:40.209> even<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.660> couple

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
delay the launch maybe even a couple

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.569 
delay the launch maybe even a couple
years<00:03:41.019> past<00:03:41.319> 2014<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.220> most<00:03:42.430> likely

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
years past 2014 but most likely

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.360 
years past 2014 but most likely
somewhere<00:03:43.180> around<00:03:43.299> then<00:03:43.690> when<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.440> xbox<00:03:44.889> 720

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
somewhere around then when the xbox 720

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.240 
somewhere around then when the xbox 720
does<00:03:45.700> come<00:03:46.030> out<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.480> 2014<00:03:46.989> as<00:03:47.319> well<00:03:47.980> most

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
does come out in 2014 as well most

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.949 
does come out in 2014 as well most
likely<00:03:48.669> I<00:03:48.819> mean<00:03:49.000> these<00:03:49.180> are<00:03:49.299> all<00:03:49.389> rumors<00:03:49.840> I'm

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
likely I mean these are all rumors I'm

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.839 
likely I mean these are all rumors I'm
just<00:03:50.109> putting<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.530> rumors<00:03:50.829> there<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.639> yes

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
just putting out the rumors there so yes

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.860

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.990
