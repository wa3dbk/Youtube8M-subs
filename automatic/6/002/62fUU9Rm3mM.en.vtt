now<00:00:04.200> fluid<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:05.120> constantly<00:00:06.120> on<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.359> move<00:00:06.710> must

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
now fluid is constantly on the move must

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.780 
now fluid is constantly on the move must
it<00:00:07.799> feel<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:08.069> unless<00:00:08.250> your<00:00:08.429> ankles<00:00:08.670> are

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
it feel like unless your ankles are

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.009 
it feel like unless your ankles are
swollen<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> doesn't<00:00:09.420> feel<00:00:09.510> like<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.750> moves

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
swollen and doesn't feel like it moves

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.499 
swollen and doesn't feel like it moves
anywhere<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.250> fluid<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.670> generally<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
anywhere but fluid is generally on the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780 
anywhere but fluid is generally on the
move<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.410> moves<00:00:13.620> three<00:00:14.190> different<00:00:14.639> ways

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
move and it moves three different ways

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.279 
move and it moves three different ways
active<00:00:15.780> transport<00:00:16.609> diffusion<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.820> osmosis

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
active transport diffusion and osmosis

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.510 
active transport diffusion and osmosis
so<00:00:19.289> we've<00:00:19.380> got<00:00:19.500> fluid<00:00:19.800> constantly<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
so we've got fluid constantly on the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
so we've got fluid constantly on the
move<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.060> moving<00:00:21.510> three<00:00:21.869> ways<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.380> are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
move it's moving three ways what are

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.290 
move it's moving three ways what are
they<00:00:22.650> active<00:00:23.490> transport<00:00:25.849> okay<00:00:26.849> let's<00:00:27.150> walk

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
they active transport okay let's walk

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.189 
they active transport okay let's walk
through<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> look<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.840> those<00:00:27.960> look<00:00:28.140> like

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
through and look at what those look like

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
through and look at what those look like
no<00:00:28.439> active<00:00:28.949> transport<00:00:29.519> means<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
no active transport means it's kind of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.580 
no active transport means it's kind of
going<00:00:30.179> against<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> stream<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> think

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
going against the stream if you think

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.260 
going against the stream if you think
they'll<00:00:31.769> salmon<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.489> upstream<00:00:32.850> right

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
they'll salmon they go upstream right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.700 
they'll salmon they go upstream right
because<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> moves<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.440> higher

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because it moves from a higher

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
because it moves from a higher
concentration<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.610> lower<00:00:35.820> concentration<00:00:36.059> I'm

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
concentration a lower concentration I'm

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.500 
concentration a lower concentration I'm
sorry<00:00:36.870> moves<00:00:37.440> from<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> higher<00:00:37.890> concentration

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
sorry moves from a higher concentration

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
sorry moves from a higher concentration
could<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.570> try<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> again<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> can

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
could I try that again we see if I can

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.240 
could I try that again we see if I can
get<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.120> mixed<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.629> before<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.020> go

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
get you really mixed up before we go

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.760 
get you really mixed up before we go
active<00:00:44.250> transport<00:00:44.879> requires<00:00:45.420> energy<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
active transport requires energy it

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
active transport requires energy it
moves<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> lower<00:00:47.370> concentration<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
moves from a lower concentration to a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
moves from a lower concentration to a
higher<00:00:48.870> concentration<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.829> molecules<00:00:50.370> are

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
higher concentration the molecules are

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
higher concentration the molecules are
moving<00:00:51.180> against<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> concentration<00:00:52.620> now

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
moving against the concentration now

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.770 
moving against the concentration now
here's<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> good<00:00:54.000> news<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.719> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here's the good news now that you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
here's the good news now that you
confused<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.320> active<00:00:55.770> transport<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.730> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
confused about active transport it's not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
confused about active transport it's not
the<00:00:57.239> main<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> talk<00:00:58.320> about

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the main one we're going to talk about

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
the main one we're going to talk about
today<00:00:58.649> okay<00:00:58.980> we're<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:00:59.969> more<00:01:00.329> on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
today okay we're going to get more on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
today okay we're going to get more on
diffusion<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.829> osmosis<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.699> let's<00:01:02.850> get

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
diffusion and osmosis so let's get

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.329 
diffusion and osmosis so let's get
active<00:01:03.180> transport<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> way<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
active transport out of the way and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.240 
active transport out of the way and
let's<00:01:05.640> move<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.350> osmosis<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:07.979> water

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
let's move on osmosis is when water

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
let's move on osmosis is when water
moves<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:08.790> selectively<00:01:09.750> permeable

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
moves through selectively permeable

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
moves through selectively permeable
membranes<00:01:10.950> from<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.729> lower<00:01:12.090> concentration<00:01:12.479> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
membranes from a lower concentration of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.310 
membranes from a lower concentration of
ions<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> higher<00:01:15.000> concentration<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:16.140> ions

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
ions to a higher concentration of ions

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.609 
ions to a higher concentration of ions
so<00:01:16.920> what's<00:01:17.100> moving<00:01:17.659> water<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.380> moving

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
so what's moving water and it's moving

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
so what's moving water and it's moving
from<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.310> lower<00:01:20.820> concentration<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> higher

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
from a lower concentration to a higher

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
from a lower concentration to a higher
concentration<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> what's<00:01:24.750> trying<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
concentration so what's trying to do is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460 
concentration so what's trying to do is
to<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.030> homeostasis<00:01:27.259> that's<00:01:28.259> why

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to get to homeostasis that's why

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
to get to homeostasis that's why
whatever<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> talk<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:29.939> fluids<00:01:30.900> being

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
whatever is we talk about fluids being

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
whatever is we talk about fluids being
saltier<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.009> means<00:01:32.159> they<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> higher

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
saltier that means they have a higher

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
saltier that means they have a higher
concentration<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:34.049> lower<00:01:34.259> concentration

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
concentration the lower concentration

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
concentration the lower concentration
will<00:01:35.070> move<00:01:35.310> toward<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> bring

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
will move toward that to try to bring

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.609 
will move toward that to try to bring
everything<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.799> normal<00:01:38.630> okay<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.200> fluid

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
everything back to normal okay so fluid

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
everything back to normal okay so fluid
moves<00:01:40.890> between<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.520> extracellular<00:01:42.180> space

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
moves between the extracellular space

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.109 
moves between the extracellular space
and<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.890> intracellular<00:01:44.369> space<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and the the intracellular space and the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.870 
and the the intracellular space and the
extracellular<00:01:45.659> space<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.979> intravascular

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
extracellular space the intravascular

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.530 
extracellular space the intravascular
and<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.899> extravascular<00:01:49.710> okay<00:01:50.369> that's<00:01:50.820> kind

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and the extravascular okay that's kind

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
and the extravascular okay that's kind
of<00:01:51.630> where<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.990> headed<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
of where we're headed so you think and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280 
of where we're headed so you think and
do<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.220> need<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> whole<00:01:53.729> slide<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.259> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
do we need a whole slide just for that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
do we need a whole slide just for that
when<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.310> say<00:01:56.630> intracellular<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
when we say intracellular and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
when we say intracellular and
extracellular<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.740> means<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.700> cell<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
extracellular that means in the cell and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.840 
extracellular that means in the cell and
out<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> cell<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.130> circulation<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
out of the cell in the circulation and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
out of the cell in the circulation and
all<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> circulation<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.600> diffusion<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
all the circulation now diffusion is a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.139 
all the circulation now diffusion is a
couple<00:02:05.130> things<00:02:06.140> hydrostatic<00:02:07.140> pressure<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
couple things hydrostatic pressure and

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
couple things hydrostatic pressure and
oncotic<00:02:09.149> pressure<00:02:10.069> then<00:02:11.069> we're<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
oncotic pressure then we're going to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.070 
oncotic pressure then we're going to
break<00:02:11.550> those<00:02:11.730> down<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.300> talk<00:02:12.720> about<00:02:12.930> what

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
break those down and talk about what

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.880 
break those down and talk about what
they<00:02:13.230> are<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.440> exam

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
they are in exam

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.570 
they are in exam
actually<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.610> work<00:02:15.860> okay<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.220> diffusion

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
actually how they work okay so diffusion

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.340 
actually how they work okay so diffusion
is<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.000> passive<00:02:18.690> movement<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.170> molecules

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
is this passive movement of molecules

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.080 
is this passive movement of molecules
across<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.040> membrane<00:02:20.370> from<00:02:20.819> what

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
across a membrane from what

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.530 
across a membrane from what
concentration<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:22.020> higher<00:02:22.800> concentration<00:02:23.540> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
concentration a higher concentration to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.080 
concentration a higher concentration to
a<00:02:24.569> lower
