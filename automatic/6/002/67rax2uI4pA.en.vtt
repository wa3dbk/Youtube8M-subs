00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
style but let's not take that in as you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
style but let's not take that in as you
know<00:02:48.950> as<00:02:49.340> ink<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.330> paper<00:02:50.540> because<00:02:51.110> sometimes

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
now there is no kdz file so there's no

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.300 
now there is no kdz file so there's no
way<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.630> flashing<00:02:57.230> your<00:02:57.320> phone<00:02:57.530> back<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:58.010> stock

and of course we don't have tort

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
recovery so we can't build like you know

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.450 
recovery so we can't build like you know
we<00:03:03.230> can't<00:03:03.410> take<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.620> system<00:03:03.770> update<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.370> be

able to flash it through custom recovery

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.390 
able to flash it through custom recovery
because<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.570> don't<00:03:08.720> have<00:03:08.900> one<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.740> if<00:03:10.070> you<00:03:10.220> own

they're like how do we update our phones
or<00:03:54.800> whatever<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.880> reason<00:03:56.210> why<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:56.360> can't<00:03:56.720> is

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
or whatever the reason why you can't is

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.590 
or whatever the reason why you can't is
because<00:03:57.260> while<00:03:57.590> LG<00:03:57.830> how<00:03:58.370> some<00:03:58.670> people<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.480> an

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
because while LG how some people have an

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.210 
because while LG how some people have an
opinion<00:03:59.840> that<00:03:59.960> LG<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.410> kind<00:04:00.740> of<00:04:00.800> adopted

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
opinion that LG is kind of adopted

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.260 
opinion that LG is kind of adopted
things<00:04:01.460> from<00:04:01.610> Samsung<00:04:02.060> like<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.200> previous<00:04:03.830> um

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
things from Samsung like the previous um

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.190 
things from Samsung like the previous um
Optimus<00:04:05.270> launcher<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.810> kind<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.080> looked

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
Optimus launcher that kind of looked

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.290 
Optimus launcher that kind of looked
like<00:04:06.230> TouchWiz<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:07.250> also<00:04:07.460> adopted<00:04:07.880> what

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
like TouchWiz they also adopted what

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.199 
like TouchWiz they also adopted what
Samsung<00:04:08.570> has<00:04:09.470> which<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:09.980> what's<00:04:10.670> called<00:04:10.880> Knox

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
Samsung has which is what's called Knox

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.930 
Samsung has which is what's called Knox
now<00:04:11.900> in<00:04:12.080> LG<00:04:12.440> it's<00:04:12.620> not<00:04:12.770> called<00:04:13.040> Knox<00:04:13.370> but

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
now in LG it's not called Knox but

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.630 
now in LG it's not called Knox but
basically<00:04:14.420> it's<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.930> file<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.920> once<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.430> root

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
basically it's a file that once you root

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.900 
basically it's a file that once you root
your<00:04:16.670> device<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:18.470> severs<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> file<00:04:19.520> and<00:04:19.790> you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
your device it severs the file and you

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.960 
your device it severs the file and you
cannot<00:04:20.330> ever<00:04:21.070> reset<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.220> file<00:04:22.460> back<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.760> the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
cannot ever reset that file back to the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.460 
cannot ever reset that file back to the
way

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
way

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.680 
way
like<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:23.950> factory<00:04:24.370> reset<00:04:24.550> even<00:04:25.180> if<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.360> factory

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
like a factory reset even if you factory

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.270 
like a factory reset even if you factory
reset<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:26.080> device<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.500> does<00:04:26.620> not<00:04:26.800> fix<00:04:27.100> that

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
reset your device it does not fix that

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.620 
reset your device it does not fix that
file<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.670> once<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.210> just<00:04:28.390> think<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.570> it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
file so once you can just think of it

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.430 
file so once you can just think of it
like<00:04:28.690> like<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.620> bridge<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.460> once<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.390> root<00:04:31.690> you

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
like like a bridge and once you root you

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.500 
like like a bridge and once you root you
sever<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.950> bridge<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.610> cannot<00:04:34.000> repair<00:04:34.390> the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
sever that bridge you cannot repair the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.870 
sever that bridge you cannot repair the
bridge<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.020> when<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.950> update<00:04:36.280> goes<00:04:36.520> through

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
bridge and when the update goes through

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.090 
bridge and when the update goes through
weather<00:04:37.840> system<00:04:38.200> update<00:04:38.410> does<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.830> when<00:04:38.980> it

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
weather system update does is when it

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.770 
weather system update does is when it
first<00:04:39.340> begins<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.910> install<00:04:40.240> what<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.510> does<00:04:40.660> is

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
first begins to install what it does is

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.210 
first begins to install what it does is
it<00:04:40.900> goes<00:04:41.050> through<00:04:41.350> your<00:04:41.440> system<00:04:41.770> files<00:04:42.010> and

update files now that one bridge I'm

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.410 
update files now that one bridge I'm
telling<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.310> about<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.610> file<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.210> is

telling you about that file that is

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.240 
telling you about that file that is
broken<00:04:52.720> when<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.050> root<00:04:53.320> once<00:04:53.710> that's<00:04:53.920> broken

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
broken when you root once that's broken

while it's going through the system
files<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.500> make<00:04:56.950> sure<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.520> able<00:04:57.610> to

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790

files to make sure that it is able to
flash<00:04:58.000> over<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:59.070> finds<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.220> one<00:05:00.460> file<00:05:00.790> that's

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
flash over it finds that one file that's

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.570 
flash over it finds that one file that's
broken<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.930> automatically<00:05:02.680> Eric<00:05:03.070> rejects

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
broken and it automatically Eric rejects

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.760 
broken and it automatically Eric rejects
so<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.600> reason<00:05:04.750> why<00:05:05.020> no<00:05:05.530> matter<00:05:05.680> what

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
so that's the reason why no matter what

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.860 
so that's the reason why no matter what
you<00:05:06.010> do<00:05:06.190> if<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.670> ungrouped<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.420> can<00:05:07.570> put<00:05:07.750> back

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
you do if you ungrouped you can put back

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.250 
you do if you ungrouped you can put back
all<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.350> bloatware<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:09.520> will<00:05:09.670> not<00:05:10.000> update<00:05:10.720> so

styler or pick another device or
something<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.680> don't<00:05:38.740> know

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
something I don't know

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.740 
something I don't know
hopefully<00:05:41.940> LG<00:05:42.940> will<00:05:43.120> release<00:05:43.390> a<00:05:43.419> stock

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
hopefully LG will release a stock

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.450 
hopefully LG will release a stock
firmware<00:05:44.020> I'm<00:05:44.320> really<00:05:44.650> hoping<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:44.980> they

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
firmware I'm really hoping that they

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.360 
firmware I'm really hoping that they
will<00:05:45.610> they<00:05:46.270> did<00:05:46.540> release<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.110> stock<00:05:47.320> kbz<00:05:48.130> file

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
will they did release the stock kbz file

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.250 
will they did release the stock kbz file
for<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.880> metro<00:05:49.120> pcs<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:49.540> t-mobile<00:05:49.810> version

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
for the metro pcs and t-mobile version

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.450 
for the metro pcs and t-mobile version
so<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:50.440> think<00:05:50.560> it's<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.800> little<00:05:50.890> unfair<00:05:51.070> they

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
so I think it's a little unfair they

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.740 
so I think it's a little unfair they
won't<00:05:51.700> do<00:05:51.850> it<00:05:51.970> for<00:05:52.000> the<00:05:52.390> Sprint<00:05:52.660> Boost<00:05:52.900> Mobile
