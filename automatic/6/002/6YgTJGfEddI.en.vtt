00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.529
 new from kangaroo with markovic always at 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.529
 kangaroo together 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.519
 The kangaroo is totally on a wallach 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.589
 used to be at the concrete and chasing now 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 just the penguin but only incidentally 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.070
 down to business 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.119
 we have a Vietnamese coast 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.890
 upholstered 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.230
 in a small tourist bungalow with 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.259
 Air conditioning whirlpool and own 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 palm grove all the luxury costs almost 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.309
 outrageously looking for two dollars a night 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.989
 The kangaroo says suddenly and try 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.550
 to prevent him from being vicious 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.390
 neoliberal world if I go through the plan 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.170
 can implement 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.339
 Ok, I say lying in the whirlpool without 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.050
 to open my eyes 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.760
 we have to make a knock 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 so that upon my return knows that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.280
 I'm not a danger consist okay 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.909
 that should be our sign says that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.449
 kangaroo and knocking on the door three times 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.940
 that's the stupidest sign of that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.010
 I've ever heard then say 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.710
 Expired is no sign 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.760
 Nonsense does not matter , nobody says 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.540
 the kangaroo and disappear 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.970
 out there right after knocking three times yes 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.619
 What's the question? I'm doing the door 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:24.729
 an unknown person asks me 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.130
 Vietnamese good day said one 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.990
 Friendly to cure you no length too 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.039
 much for your dsl connection 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.789
 I'm baff saying I have already 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.920
 from co2 note name from legal 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.600
 Founded by the editorial 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.760
 it's with the r I wonder why 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.290
 i can use you i want you 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.550
 not overwhelm us with that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.030
 ClichÃ©s correspond to that of me 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.530
 to have 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.120
 this diminishes according to the latest polls 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.120
 the probability of one 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100
 contract that overtaxed me 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.960
 Now I'm forgiving 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 a bit I say and close the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 door still screaming from outside 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.730
 I lie down in the whirlpool again 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.560
 a few minutes later there is a knock on the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.140
 door 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.520
 Three times I leave the hot tub 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.900
 The door is a fat women 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550
 little boy in an even smaller one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.200
 suit 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.570
 Take a short five minutes 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.480
 for god says the woman has you 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.240
 nowhere is his peace call i god 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.400
 Everywhere the woman says close the door 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.820
 get back in the whirlpool and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.490
 Sleep a knock me company 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.500
 knocking again is five times 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.700
 then it knocks twice with a long break 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.260
 in between and then twice with a short one 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.190
 break calls the mark forget 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.480
 call me twice, come in! 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.480
 I give you a castle
