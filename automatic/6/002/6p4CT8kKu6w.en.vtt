00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.589
 hello my name is mario martÃ­nez I live in 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
 Chile I came to the sea 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.610
 I want to invite us to see my blog that is 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.980
 www dot receives art chile dot 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.960
 blogspot.com I have already uploaded new photos 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.050
 new videos so I invite you there 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.050
 are the links now today I want 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.140
 teach them to recycle already for those who 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.810
 they like to see this lining by bicycle 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.800
 of bicycle tires already with 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.800
 we are going to do 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.870
 and purses you can do all kinds of 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.160
 things billboards also then we go 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.210
 to logically need the lining 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 zipper and not crochet 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 scissors and a needle for the are the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 materials that we are going to use now 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.340
 that I'm going to do, I'm going to measure this with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.610
 regarding the size of true me always 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.850
 I leave you a little bit longer than 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.089
 is 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.260
 the base of closure and there we cut the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.070
 appropriate size 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.070
 then we cut here 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.210
 and then we're going to open something else that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.880
 let's also let's cut here we're going to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.880
 occupy in this is the take out bite 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.020
 then with punch we go 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.720
 to go making holes 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.160
 here by loris 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.619
 always and I'm going there drilling 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.840
 making the holes 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.720
 and once we have all of our 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.830
 little camera so we have everything with the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.870
 holes we're going to make a fabric by the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.920
 shore d 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.380
 a medium 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 soon two low points as they call 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.090
 some people then we're going to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.050
 shine all the parts and it's like this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.150
 Now I want me to always do with 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.060
 this and I'm combining colors already of the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.550
 closures with the thread usually part 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.210
 of a little corner and we are doing the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.670
 low point 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.340
 so now I 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.349
 What am I doing? I am placing two 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:41.349
 points for each hole so two points 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:44.620
 for each hole and now when and 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:48.190
 after doing all this the two 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.209
 points in each hole a detail in 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.030
 the corners already to go bending one 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.050
 place five points in the hole of the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.709
 corner 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.040
 to be able to turn around correctly 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:07.450
 here we always go two points two points 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.690
 in each hole like this until you reach the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.690
 corner 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.740
 Oh 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.540
 then as I told you in this part 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.650
 let's place 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 5 point here I got to the corner 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.900
 we make 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.100
 one 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.100
 two 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.230
 already 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.230
 3 this third that is for the corner 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.819
 4 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.760
 and 5 and she have marked the corner and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.340
 we keep making the 2 low points by 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.250
 each 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.140
 once 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:56.880
 what we have done all around we are going 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.570
 To weave a circle we are going to weave a 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.570
 circle 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.660
 to this part the part of here to be able 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.400
 cover our side and purse 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 so here we have to go 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.530
 measuring me in this case I do two 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.880
 high- point runs and once point 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.000
 low that makes me the diameter 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.120
 more the width of the closing I have to 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.120
 consider for that circle the diameter 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.510
 which has the lining with the diameter of the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.280
 close and once after that I'll 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:41.520
 I hit here so it goes hitting it goes away 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.850
 doing and then proceed to place 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.000
 the closing there I always leave by 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.250
 example I make this circle and left you 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.170
 the long thread for this same thread 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.780
 get to know him at al fort and afterwards 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.960
 we proceed to glue the closure I 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.290
 I always stick with the same thread that I've 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.170
 had to be part of it already 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.420
 of our work now once we 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.040
 we have stuck the closure and we can enter 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.040
 to decorate to paint 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.340
 it's going to stay like that, I painted it in this case 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.160
 you use relief painting like that and how 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.530
 they said they can be used different 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:31.810
 colors and using here I used silk 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.730
 different threads that harmonizes the thread with 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.910
 the zipper or zipper as you 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.980
 says in some countries 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.529
 subscribe week to week I will be 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.109
 uploading new videos 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.909
 there it is and even here they always 

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:49.189
 I try to do something that characterizes 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:53.100
 this red for example and copihue them 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:55.440
 what is the national flower of chile 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.130
 subscribe if we see you in a following 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.130
 tutorial
