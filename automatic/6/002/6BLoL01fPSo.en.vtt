00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
 as well as in this generation we are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.180
 surrounded by such successful consoles there were 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 some who tried to innovate the way 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
 play is simply they died in the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.730
 I try for that reason I bring you today 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.059
 the top 5 of the consoles that failed 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.059
 in the attempt 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.230
 place number 5 takes it in that 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.880
 manufactured so in the year 2003 today 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.619
 in day if we think of a cell phone with the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.380
 ability to play high video games 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.779
 quality is quite common but 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.669
 in 2003 things were pretty 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.350
 different although the cell phones already 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.269
 they had little games there 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.519
 that quality that distinguishes a console 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.320
 Portable common cell within 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.300
 that environment does not mean I launch a 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.250
 laptop that will innovate by combining 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.650
 cell functions and virtues of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.900
 a console and so steal the land that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.910
 they have completely dominated nintendo 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.920
 with your game boy advance at the start 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.570
 commission was promising the idea of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 combine a portable console with a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.379
 cellular was something new at that time but 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.770
 the design of the console did 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.230
 uncomfortable and difficult to play video games 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.879
 as well as making calls provoking 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.640
 that it would fail having only 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.020
 60 games at your disposal and one 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.180
 disappointment for the people that the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 acquired by leaving the nokia the only 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 option not to produce it anymore 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.710
 instead of 4 it takes it has been 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.900
 manufactured by phillips in the year 1991 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.390
 it was the beginning of the 90s and the consoles 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.580
 of video games were just those devices 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.230
 that nothing else produced games for 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.180
 philips was the right time to 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.700
 create a multimedia system that will encompass 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 a wider field not only reproduced 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.390
 games but we could also see 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.280
 videos videos encyclopedias and obviously 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.440
 audio in addition to other applications 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.760
 multimedia the problem is that it was used 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.430
 a type of disc created specifically 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.530
 for the console doing quite 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.550
 limited the content that could be 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.500
 to take advantage of 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.870
 had very few games people 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 really did not have any interest in this 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.790
 supposed console making it a 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.790
 great commercial failure for philips 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 place number 3 takes it tweed and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 manufactured by panasonic in the year 1993 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.620
 in theory the tweet was one of the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 consoles that everyone wanted to have was a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.390
 powerful 32-bit console capable of 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 make graphics in trade and the bruno of 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.020
 this console was neither the capacity nor 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.060
 quality but the cost that it had in the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.760
 market at its launch had a price 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 of 700 dollars few people could give themselves the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.110
 luxury of paying so much for a console and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 taking into account that nintendo with the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.540
 snet and arrives with the genesis dominated the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.560
 market and had the largest catalog 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.730
 of video games 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 simply these two consoles 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.630
 they ended up killing the console 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.060
 panasonic leaving it in oblivion 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.480
 just a console that you did not want 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.480
 acquire 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.720
 instead the number 2 is carried tarija 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.730
 manufactured by atari in the year 1993 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.950
 jaguar is one of those consoles in the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.480
 that promises to be amazing and powerful 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.540
 atari assured that it was one of those 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.880
 64-bit consoles later it was discovered 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.010
 that his graphic chip was only 32 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.890
 bits in addition to having a full catalog 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.120
 of bad video games and companies 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.920
 they stopped giving him their support 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.920
 selling after one year the amount 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.720
 miserable of 100,000 units and this was 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 the end of atari as a developer of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 video game consoles 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.740
 the number one place takes it 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.950
 unquestionably virtual I'm manufactured 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.810
 by nintendo in the year 1995 although 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 Nintendo is known for its peculiar 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.430
 way to innovate the way videogames 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.040
 a clear has not always gone well 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.569
 example of it is virtual boy and a 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.819
 console that I would supposedly give you 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.950
 graphics between depp and the problem was 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.079
 that the graphics looked pretty bad and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.150
 all the usual red color if a 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.370
 that we add the need to put 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.169
 six double batteries to be able to have 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.510
 barely a span of two miserable 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.640
 hours of play and a little the catalog of 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.890
 titles and the discomfort of playing in the 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.780
 console this caused that virtual 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.560
 it became the biggest failure of the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.560
 Japanese company 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.660
 Cleaning 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.149
 if you liked this video remember carmen 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.249
