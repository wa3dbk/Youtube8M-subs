the<00:01:05.909> last<00:01:06.090> time<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.450> were<00:01:06.540> booked<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the last time they were booked in a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
the last time they were booked in a
decent<00:01:07.470> match<00:01:07.619> where<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> good

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
decent match where there was a good

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
decent match where there was a good
effort<00:01:08.850> gone<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> match<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
effort gone into the match and really

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
effort gone into the match and really
this<00:01:10.680> matter<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> good<00:01:11.460> decent<00:01:11.640> effort

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this matter is not a good decent effort

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.250 
this matter is not a good decent effort
towards<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> bills<00:01:13.080> been

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
towards that I think the bills been

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
towards that I think the bills been
really<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:13.890> towards<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> match

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
really really good towards this match

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
really really good towards this match
and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.630> could<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.020> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and I think it could be really really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.480 
and I think it could be really really
big<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.460> contender<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> show<00:01:18.659> stealer<00:01:18.900> on

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
big be contender to be a show stealer on

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.350 
big be contender to be a show stealer on
Sunday<00:01:20.490> night<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.060> think<00:01:21.119> there's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
Sunday night because I think there's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
Sunday night because I think there's
been<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.720> much<00:01:21.840> effort<00:01:22.080> gone<00:01:22.380> into<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.680> match

where<00:02:14.710> Johnson<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.460> here<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.910> think

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
where Johnson is not here I think

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.600 
where Johnson is not here I think
there's<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.720> really<00:02:16.960> really<00:02:17.380> big<00:02:17.740> chance<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
there's a really really big chance the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.340 
there's a really really big chance the
Cody<00:02:18.910> Rhodes<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.390> going<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.930> nod<00:02:20.140> and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
Cody Rhodes is going to get the nod and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.560 
Cody Rhodes is going to get the nod and
slip<00:02:20.950> into<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.370> main<00:02:21.670> event<00:02:22.030> spot<00:02:22.180> for<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
slip into that main event spot for the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.450 
slip into that main event spot for the
next<00:02:22.930> few<00:02:23.080> months<00:02:23.230> because<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.310> only

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
next few months because really the only

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.610 
next few months because really the only
thing<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.910> was<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.780> downfall<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.320> Cody

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
thing that was the the downfall of Cody

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.170 
thing that was the the downfall of Cody
Rhodes<00:02:26.800> before<00:02:27.220> he<00:02:27.280> went<00:02:27.430> away<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:28.060> his

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
Rhodes before he went away on his

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.570 
Rhodes before he went away on his
honeymoon<00:02:28.210> was<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.470> Cody<00:02:29.800> Rhodes<00:02:30.040> had<00:02:30.280> never

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
honeymoon was the Cody Rhodes had never

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.250 
honeymoon was the Cody Rhodes had never
really<00:02:30.880> had<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> decent<00:02:31.330> chance<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.080> beating

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
really had a decent chance of beating

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.350 
really had a decent chance of beating
the<00:02:32.560> main<00:02:32.740> event<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.670> think<00:02:33.880> he's<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:34.210> he's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the main event and I think he's if he's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.540 
the main event and I think he's if he's
given<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.810> good<00:02:35.050> opportunity<00:02:35.890> he<00:02:36.340> can

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
given that good opportunity he can

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.610 
given that good opportunity he can
really<00:02:36.820> show<00:02:37.150> what<00:02:37.180> he's<00:02:37.540> worth<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.410> fact

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
really show what he's worth and the fact

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.860 
really show what he's worth and the fact
that<00:02:38.680> John<00:02:38.980> Cena's<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.460> here<00:02:39.760> gives<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.390> huge

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that John Cena's not here gives a huge

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.750 
that John Cena's not here gives a huge
gap<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.410> guy<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.650> Cody<00:02:42.100> Rhodes<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.490> slip

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
gap for a guy like Cody Rhodes to slip

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.550 
gap for a guy like Cody Rhodes to slip
in<00:02:42.940> there<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.900> really<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> name

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
in there and really really make a name
for<00:02:44.620> himself<00:02:44.830> why<00:02:45.310> John<00:02:45.670> Cena<00:02:46.000> isn't<00:02:46.420> there

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
for himself why John Cena isn't there

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.180 
for himself why John Cena isn't there
and<00:02:46.810> honestly<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:47.560> they're<00:02:47.680> gonna<00:02:47.800> waste<00:02:48.010> time

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
himself when Johnson isn't this I think

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630 
himself when Johnson isn't this I think
it's<00:03:07.360> pretty<00:03:07.480> much<00:03:07.660> urgent<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:09.190> Cody<00:03:09.430> Rhodes

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
it's pretty much urgent that Cody Rhodes

that<00:03:12.280> he<00:03:12.490> can<00:03:12.670> take<00:03:12.850> up<00:03:13.030> John<00:03:13.270> Cena's<00:03:13.630> main

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that he can take up John Cena's main

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.720 
that he can take up John Cena's main
event<00:03:14.110> spot<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.620> really<00:03:15.040> started<00:03:15.310> building

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
event spot and really started building

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
himself as a main eventer and I think

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.810 
himself as a main eventer and I think
that<00:03:17.560> would<00:03:17.620> be<00:03:17.710> really<00:03:17.740> really<00:03:18.310> beneficial

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
for Cody Rhodes I also think as soon as

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.150 
for Cody Rhodes I also think as soon as
you<00:03:21.640> get<00:03:21.760> goldis<00:03:22.240> back<00:03:22.570> he<00:03:23.170> can<00:03:23.440> really<00:03:23.950> start

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
you get goldis back he can really start

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.100 
you get goldis back he can really start
putting<00:03:24.460> over<00:03:24.580> guys<00:03:24.880> such<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:25.330> Dean<00:03:25.540> Ambrose<00:03:25.990> I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
putting over guys such as Dean Ambrose I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.900 
putting over guys such as Dean Ambrose I
think<00:03:26.290> it'd<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.500> great<00:03:26.740> if<00:03:26.770> Goldust<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
think it'd be great if Goldust you get a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.970 
think it'd be great if Goldust you get a
really<00:03:28.240> really<00:03:28.540> good<00:03:28.810> United<00:03:29.500> States<00:03:29.710> tile
