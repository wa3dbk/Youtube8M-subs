00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.729 
hot-rodded Marshalls what uses Peavy now
but<00:03:30.690> he<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:30.900> uses<00:03:31.230> Marshall<00:03:31.650> and

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
but he also uses Marshall and

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.349 
but he also uses Marshall and
Chickenfoot<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:32.879> were<00:03:33.000> looking<00:03:33.329> for

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
Chickenfoot what we were looking for

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.420 
Chickenfoot what we were looking for
really<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.019> something<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> JVM<00:03:34.950> but

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
really for something like a JVM but

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.710 
really for something like a JVM but
within<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.760> budget<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.269> really<00:03:36.450> hard<00:03:36.629> to

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
within the budget it was really hard to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.220 
within the budget it was really hard to
get<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.139> now<00:03:37.859> because<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.549> jet<00:03:38.760> city<00:03:39.230> is

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
get that now because the jet city is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.559 
get that now because the jet city is

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
based on Saldana designer Silvano's are

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.379 
based on Saldana designer Silvano's are
really<00:03:43.109> hot<00:03:43.379> rodded<00:03:43.650> Marshall<00:03:43.980> types<00:03:44.389> this

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
really hot rodded Marshall types this

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.020 
really hot rodded Marshall types this
worked<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.129> we<00:03:47.129> wish<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.430> found<00:03:47.639> it<00:03:47.730> earlier

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
worked and we wish we found it earlier

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.839 
worked and we wish we found it earlier
because<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.629> spent<00:03:48.870> hours<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.650> hours<00:03:49.849> trying

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
because you spent hours and hours trying

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.089 
because you spent hours and hours trying
to<00:03:50.879> find<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.299> tog<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.569> would<00:03:51.930> work<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.440> and

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
to find the tog that would work and and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.610 
to find the tog that would work and and
finally<00:03:53.609> we<00:03:53.730> did<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.389> were<00:03:54.480> about<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.870> try<00:03:55.139> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
finally we did we were about to try the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.819 
finally we did we were about to try the
HT<00:03:56.250> 5<00:03:56.489> by<00:03:56.730> Blackstar<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> crack

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
HT 5 by Blackstar I think for a crack

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.619 
HT 5 by Blackstar I think for a crack
we're<00:03:59.129> going<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.519> anyway<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.030> as

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
we're going to do that anyway so as

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.360 
we're going to do that anyway so as
promised<00:04:01.139> since<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.650> brought<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.919> up<00:04:02.010> anyway

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
promised since we brought it up anyway

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.750 
promised since we brought it up anyway
we're<00:04:02.760> using<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.180> blackstar<00:04:04.109> HT<00:04:04.139> 5<00:04:04.620> combo<00:04:04.919> now

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
we're using the blackstar HT 5 combo now

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.800 
we're using the blackstar HT 5 combo now
we've<00:04:06.599> just<00:04:06.629> nailed<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.980> sach<00:04:08.489> tone<00:04:08.819> yet

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
we've just nailed the sach tone yet

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.319 
we've just nailed the sach tone yet
again<00:04:10.139> I<00:04:10.410> would<00:04:10.919> say<00:04:11.069> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.430> possibly<00:04:12.060> even

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
again I would say this is possibly even

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.099 
again I would say this is possibly even
more<00:04:12.449> authentic<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:14.329> we<00:04:15.329> didn't<00:04:15.629> even<00:04:15.810> need

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
more authentic and we didn't even need

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.870 
more authentic and we didn't even need
saturate<00:04:16.919> out<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.280> my<00:04:17.400> box

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
saturate out of my box

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.819 
saturate out of my box
so<00:04:18.510> we've<00:04:18.690> discarded<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.440> we're<00:04:19.799> just

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
so we've discarded this we're just

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.199 
so we've discarded this we're just
easing<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.370> overdrive<00:04:20.729> from<00:04:20.910> near<00:04:21.060> the

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
easing the overdrive from near the

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.779 
easing the overdrive from near the
amplifier<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.410> we<00:04:23.010> thought<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:23.430> with<00:04:23.580> us<00:04:23.669> to

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
amplifier and we thought this with us to

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.570 
amplifier and we thought this with us to
spend<00:04:23.970> budget<00:04:24.360> why<00:04:24.870> not<00:04:25.050> work<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.590> an<00:04:26.190> awesome

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
spend budget why not work in an awesome

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.570 
spend budget why not work in an awesome
electro<00:04:27.360> harmonix<00:04:27.780> cathedral<00:04:28.410> reverb<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.520> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
electro harmonix cathedral reverb so you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.380 
electro harmonix cathedral reverb so you
get<00:04:29.789> this<00:04:29.910> kind<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.210> bleed

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.659 

yeah

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.600

beautiful<00:04:57.699> Saturday<00:04:58.289> it's<00:04:59.289> I<00:04:59.560> mean<00:04:59.710> what<00:04:59.979> a

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
beautiful Saturday it's I mean what a

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.679 
beautiful Saturday it's I mean what a
great<00:05:00.099> sounding<00:05:00.610> amplifier<00:05:01.120> here's<00:05:01.599> the

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
great sounding amplifier here's the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.990 
great sounding amplifier here's the
thing<00:05:01.900> though<00:05:02.080> it's<00:05:02.349> five<00:05:02.620> watts<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.669> if

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
thing though it's five watts so if

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.550 
thing though it's five watts so if
you're<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.389> gig<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:04.990> you've<00:05:05.169> got<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.379> play<00:05:05.530> a

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you're a gig and you've got to play a

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.950 
you're a gig and you've got to play a
volume<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.129> race<00:05:06.310> for<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.550> band<00:05:06.789> I<00:05:07.090> know<00:05:07.780> you

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
volume and race for the band I know you

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.839 
volume and race for the band I know you
can<00:05:08.229> do<00:05:08.469> it<00:05:08.530> as<00:05:08.860> long<00:05:08.979> as<00:05:09.219> you<00:05:09.280> can<00:05:09.430> make<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.610> up

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
can do it as long as you can make it up

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.230 
can do it as long as you can make it up
but<00:05:10.060> this<00:05:11.280> beautiful<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.400> 20<00:05:12.699> watt<00:05:12.849> head<00:05:13.060> would

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
but this beautiful in 20 watt head would

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.209 
but this beautiful in 20 watt head would
do<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.449> job<00:05:13.500> possibly<00:05:14.500> more<00:05:14.650> practically

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
do the job possibly more practically

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.029 
do the job possibly more practically
than<00:05:15.849> a<00:05:15.879> 5<00:05:16.150> watt<00:05:16.360> combo<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.409> you<00:05:17.590> wanted<00:05:17.860> an

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
than a 5 watt combo if you wanted an

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:20.279 
than a 5 watt combo if you wanted an
absolutely<00:05:18.520> authentic<00:05:18.729> tone<00:05:19.330> for<00:05:19.870> under<00:05:20.080> a
