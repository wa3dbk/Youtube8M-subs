00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.200
 we decided with rolando bins of the 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.249
 roland car toyota dealership for 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.929
 arezzo and province to answer 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:14.480
 monthly to your questions as 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.619
 a tire service was on the air 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:23.210
 thermal and their obligation up to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.599
 when until April 15 until 15 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.079
 April 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.929
 one of our first spectators 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.750
 he writes to us but not in this heat 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.079
 they consume too much forced franceschi ti 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.250
 it's convenient so they sell more 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.300
 let's clarify that there is no percentage 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.219
 on the tires sold by the news and then 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.890
 there is no percentage 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.600
 on the tires sold and also loyal injured 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.399
 because I don't need very little 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.160
 let alone they are imposed allow 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.109
 from the percentages from him however it is done it is 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.219
 that the thermal tires are of the law from 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.710
 first of November to 15 April then the 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.339
 law plans to mount these tires 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.739
 thermal 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.200
 it is true that temperatures are not so 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.410
 however, it hardens the thermal rubber up to one 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.180
 10 15 degrees temperature is fine 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.580
 and then later it is not that you wear little rejection 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710
 the use depends on which one the stage 1 the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.040
 tire stress even on the road 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.950
 normal ones are consumed and deteriorate 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.480
 however the thermal rubber starts the fact that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.130
 of law according to the uses in way 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.500
 normal we have customers who 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.900
 they hold both summer and winter is one 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.870
 rubber slightly softer than one 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.750
 however, normal rubber is not consumed 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.630
 so or the thing then deteriorates 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.270
 fundamental in my opinion is not so much the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.910
 rubber consumption and not even the law 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.920
 which obliges us to love security 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.100
 which is fundamental that is always put into 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.930
 second floor which in my opinion is not good 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 that is, first we look at security then 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.580
 better to change in life than 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 a car two more tires than 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.600
 go to the brawls months of hospital 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.050
 pay luciano special site if this 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 consular type I keep the tires myself 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.640
 thermal throughout the year 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.840
 I remember that many years ago and the other 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 it is no longer a day that comes 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.510
 cars when they came especially 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.610
 winter customers from northern europe 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.520
 they already had all the tires fitted to them 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.580
 in the newspapers and I also said then 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.500
 but look a little at these Germans 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.450
 Austrians who were I say are 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 porn set and instead slowly plan if 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.360
 is verifying that winter tires 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 they are really fantastic for use 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.550
 in winter not only if more if it snows or if 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.709
 there is ice because that is obvious 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.380
 that we want but also with the fund 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.010
 road is very cold or wet 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.959
 winter rubber has a sharp yield 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.410
 much better then we don't look 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 on the side they are consumed then they cost 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.910
 as the others then not even the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.550
 Today's tires are no longer no longer have 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.190
 a hyperbolic figure as in the years 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.350
 past summaries as they are finding already 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.930
 boari good prices but tires or you 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.590
 we send for the bridgestone I do 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.180
 for example in a needle with 340 euros if 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.080
 Fits four winter tires 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.519
 I don't think that's the figure 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.019
 may jeopardize security 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.660
 of a family 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.940
 thank you ronaldo is his availability 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.980
 obviously as Lucian did you can 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.760
 ask us through www.chiarelettere.it 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.670
 your questions in your doubts and us 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.980
 as far as we can compete we will try 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.760
 to risk every clarify everything 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.760
 thank you thank you
