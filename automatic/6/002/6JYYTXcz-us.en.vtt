00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.320
 at g leygues we are assembler of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.809
 industrial gensets us 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 work a range that goes from 20 cellar 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.359
 and up to 350 kg in two sets and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.320
 then we know how to go up to 1200 kg ha in 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 group on order 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.380
 our research has defined a specification 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.590
 loads in 1997 which allowed us 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.660
 to standardize our manufacturing 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 we have here the beginning of the range 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.360
 the iphone that will start at 160 cellar and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
 to all of our group is composed 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 on the same principle 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.110
 they are all on skid with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 inside a tank integrated into 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.719
 the bottoms and on top an engine 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.329
 industrial 1500 laps it's a motor 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 long play in this case here a 6 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.680
 turbo diesel cylinders 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.110
 we have at the other end the generator 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.659
 it's a generator gelek over 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.250
 the generator the vr the system of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.820
 electronic regulation this chip 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.500
 themes form a boot system 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.630
 low price of 12 volts which allows us 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 to start in 24 volts with the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 starter at this place all our 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 together is cocooned 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 soundproofing our cocoon the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 sound system allows us to be eligible 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 to European standards and especially to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 code of work since in France we are 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.780
 request to be below 90 decibels 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.100
 thanks to the cocoons we are at 68 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.860
 the entire machine is driven 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.439
 end here by the control board 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 control board from smart I like 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.119
 under US license and this chart is going 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.460
 thanks to a drop-down menu after 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 simplify allow us to have access 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 to all the parameters of the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 machine and at the same time to be able to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.570
 implemented in the management of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 starts the table of cons 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.650
 Paul will check oil pressure 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.260
 temperature where the engine starts 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.210
 height of 900 rounds he performed a 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.479
 count down a few seconds and then 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.680
 we will go up to 1500 turns ie 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.410
 we're going to have a soft start 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.290
 which allows us to avoid preheating 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.530
 of the machine we will have this same type of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.280
 reasonings 1500 900 turns at the moment 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.280
 of the control room 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.920
 so we hear on Thursday the sound of 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:38.060
 six cylinders but the goal of the cocoon 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.100
 is even to succeed at the smothered at 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 gec we simplified your life 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.820
 the connection board is located at 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.220
 group edge 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.960
 indeed we have here below the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.480
 circuit breaker the system 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.860
 ats automatic start system and 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.050
 which will allow at the same time 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.240
 machine connection I'm going 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 bring my network cable underneath 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.160
 on the one- eyed and three-phase neutral and 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.960
 I'm leaving from above to my 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.050
 building fuel the turn is played 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.360
 the group will monitor the network and in 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.310
 case of cuts or malfunction 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 of for example side shift networks 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.210
 substitute and replace it all 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.980
 from the sav gelek is assured from the 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.930
 logistics platform that is based in 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.930
 brittany right next to saint brieuc
