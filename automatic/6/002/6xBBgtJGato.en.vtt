have the transmitter from the B 912
which<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.749> got<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:41.989> couple<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.499> days<00:00:42.679> ago<00:00:42.859> and<00:00:44.079> I'm

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
which I got a couple of days ago and I'm

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.149 
which I got a couple of days ago and I'm
going<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:45.769> try<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.070> find<00:00:46.719> the<00:00:47.719> 911<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.769> 912

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
going to try to find the 911 to the 912

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.059 
going to try to find the 911 to the 912
transmitter<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.999> then<00:00:50.899> fly<00:00:51.589> it<00:00:51.620> here's<00:00:51.949> the

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
transmitter and then fly it here's the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:56.470 
transmitter and then fly it here's the
911<00:00:52.579> battery<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.920> then<00:00:54.920> I'll<00:00:55.190> fly<00:00:55.519> it<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:55.940> if

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
911 battery and then I'll fly it and if

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.200 
911 battery and then I'll fly it and if
that<00:00:56.539> works<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.949> really<00:00:58.760> good<00:00:58.969> thing

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that works it's a really good thing

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.779 
that works it's a really good thing
because<00:00:59.479> this<00:01:00.019> V<00:01:00.229> 912<00:01:00.739> transmitter<00:01:01.249> is<00:01:01.640> a

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
because this V 912 transmitter is a

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.540 
because this V 912 transmitter is a
whole<00:01:02.120> lot<00:01:02.359> nicer<00:01:02.629> than<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.559> B<00:01:03.739> 911

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
whole lot nicer than the B 911

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.610 
whole lot nicer than the B 911
transmitter<00:01:05.030> which<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.780> have<00:01:05.960> here<00:01:06.440> as<00:01:06.560> a

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
transmitter which I have here as a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.219 
transmitter which I have here as a
little<00:01:07.070> comparison<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.360> actually<00:01:09.050> no

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
little comparison so actually no

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.149 
little comparison so actually no
comparison<00:01:10.270> alright<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.810> let's<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:12.439> put<00:01:12.799> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
comparison alright so let's just put the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:29.180 
comparison alright so let's just put the
battery<00:01:13.399> in<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.850> little<00:01:17.360> H<00:01:17.570> 912<00:01:18.820> switch<00:01:19.820> on

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:02:57.240 

find<00:01:29.850> fine<00:01:30.990> alright<00:01:31.530> time<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.160> little<00:01:32.280> ABBA

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
