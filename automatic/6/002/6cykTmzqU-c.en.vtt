 that you can actually find online
what<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.500> like<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.250> axillary<00:03:00.700> port

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
what I like is like the axillary port

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.869 
what I like is like the axillary port
that's<00:03:01.359> good<00:03:01.599> stuff<00:03:01.840> what<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:02.859> don't<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.519> it's

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
that's good stuff what I don't like it's

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.530 
that's good stuff what I don't like it's
that<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.930> doesn't<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.440> an<00:03:05.620> axillary<00:03:06.519> out<00:03:06.730> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that it doesn't have an axillary out so

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.979 
that it doesn't have an axillary out so
that<00:03:07.840> means<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.440> cannot<00:03:09.659> use<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:10.959> a

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
that means you cannot use it as a

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.309 
that means you cannot use it as a
Bluetooth<00:03:11.440> device<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.129> send<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:13.599> music<00:03:14.140> out
