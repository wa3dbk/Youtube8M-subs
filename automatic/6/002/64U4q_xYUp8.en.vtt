00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.530
 Hello people come to a first video 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.370
 how lived hall / mz 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.169
 from Nokia 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
 provided in all with the administration for the first time 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.990
 it weighs only with Thomas Eichhorn 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.140
 So I also had reading sat and this year 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.689
 like to end 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.919
 it will determine dead itself 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.189
 The ECDC I also look good on the design 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.359
 because it also has one 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.009
 product 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.380
 that's the Ruhr 2010 is a year ago 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 That's possible on this day 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 so much at the top 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.210
 this is the rating 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 it was set to the weir 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.250
 and that is disgusting that then happens 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.250
 as for the note and revealing good 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540
 is back miss-choice 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.680
 also the tracks 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.210
 The model is called Nokia Bluetooth Headset BH Stress 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 if 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.140
 So 60 courses of German living is one piece that they are so much more 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 you do not need to say 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.440
 so and it was indeed very closed off 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 18 00 slides 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 So Jesus is telling 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.950
 Handke is still earning money as easily as a trunk 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.770
 and that was not perceived 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.770
 quite well 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.760
 but what is the field 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.190
 that suits because it's worth the Rhine 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.100
 she's here too late 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.259
 So with me you're on the cupboard already trying out 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.860
 but I had to find solutions for the PlayStation 3 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 because Bruchhagen has nothing to do 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.180
 Biologists unbelievable 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.320
 hereby Marko from Nokia 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.119
 you also know that like z 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.739
 here the St 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 besides that makes it so mini 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.389
 DAPD 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
 The Alpenhof Murnau has nothing to say 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.899
 these still on wires destroyed APA 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 This study is indicated 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.919
 I think explosives okay but I have to try it out for myself 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.369
 If you want to describe in Mirow if so then below comments if not 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:44.239
 then not 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.399
 but I think my life is being used to her team not needed 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:49.249
 I can too 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:50.569
 Test cousin 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.569
 is not so expensive so only costs 20 euros 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.339
 So I already have 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.689
 he ordered 20 euros 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.669
 I agree with the price 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.469
 there is also still the takes 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.469
 as soon as my first one can be new channel 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.509
 would be mine 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.379
 he was 95 subscribers 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.669
 Comments and some favor 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.309
 thanks to bulk
