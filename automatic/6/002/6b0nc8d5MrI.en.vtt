00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.180 
light tripod if you walk it and then try
turn<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> will<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.319> some<00:02:13.560> bumps<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
turn it will be some bumps so you just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.530 
turn it will be some bumps so you just
have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.520> careful<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:16.130> but<00:02:17.540> besides

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
have to be careful with that but besides

that great feature you know really
utilizes<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.650> fluid<00:02:23.100> head<00:02:23.360> system<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
utilizes that fluid head system and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.949 
utilizes that fluid head system and
works<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.069> well<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.490> like<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.840> right

works really well I like it all right
here's<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> bubble<00:02:28.770> system<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.370> really

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
here's the bubble system this is really

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.900 
here's the bubble system this is really
helpful<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.270> leveling<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> tripod<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
here we have a little knob that controls

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.820 
here we have a little knob that controls
that<00:02:45.930> locks<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.410> center<00:02:47.190> arm<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:49.110> if

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that locks the center arm here that if

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.509 
that locks the center arm here that if
you<00:02:50.070> unscrew<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.269> take<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.870> fist<00:02:52.170> up

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
you unscrew it and then take the fist up

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.830 
you unscrew it and then take the fist up
and<00:02:53.519> then<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.030> either<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.690> play

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and then you can either you can play

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.570 
and then you can either you can play
just<00:02:54.900> pull<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:57.950> there<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.190> an

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
just pull it and there you have an

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.970 
just pull it and there you have an
extender<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.600> does<00:03:00.959> increase<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
extender this does increase the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.460 
extender this does increase the
shakiness<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.760> whole<00:03:02.940> thing<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.200> while

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
shakiness of the whole thing so while

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.470 
shakiness of the whole thing so while
when<00:03:05.100> shooting<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.519> don't<00:03:05.850> recommend<00:03:06.150> having

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
when shooting I don't recommend having

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.479 
when shooting I don't recommend having
this<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.410> since<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.069> already<00:03:08.220> like

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
this up because since it's already like

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.940 
this up because since it's already like
tripod<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.720> suffer<00:03:10.080> shakes<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.739> will

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
tripod and can suffer shakes this will

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.210 
tripod and can suffer shakes this will
increase<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.959> it'll<00:03:12.959> decrease<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.650> stability

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
increase it it'll decrease the stability

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.420 
increase it it'll decrease the stability
so<00:03:14.489> yeah<00:03:14.940> watch<00:03:15.390> out<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.100> all<00:03:17.100> right<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
so yeah watch out for that all right so

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.640 
so yeah watch out for that all right so
then<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.670> got<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:18.000> quick<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.870> easy<00:03:19.170> flaps

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
then you got these quick and easy flaps

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.310 
then you got these quick and easy flaps
to<00:03:20.130> extend<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> legs<00:03:21.360> out<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.780> let's<00:03:22.019> move

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
to extend the legs out so let's move

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.840 
to extend the legs out so let's move
pretty<00:03:22.799> well<00:03:24.140> they<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:28.230> know<00:03:28.340> very<00:03:29.340> smooth

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
pretty well they you know very smooth

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.289 
pretty well they you know very smooth
that<00:03:30.360> Luminum<00:03:30.900> works<00:03:31.380> well<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> extend

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
that Luminum works well so if you extend

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.840 
that Luminum works well so if you extend
them<00:03:33.480> both<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:35.100> get<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> lot<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
them both out you get a lot of the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.539 
them both out you get a lot of the
center<00:03:36.269> there<00:03:36.450> Lock<00:03:37.079> them<00:03:37.230> back<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.650> I'll

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
center there Lock them back in I'll

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.530 
center there Lock them back in I'll
collecting<00:03:39.060> at<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.570> end<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.519> these<00:03:42.299> nice
