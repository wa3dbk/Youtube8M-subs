00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
defense tonight I think we got after it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
defense tonight I think we got after it
we<00:00:35.160> convert<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> field<00:00:37.440> on

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
we convert it I got off the field on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
we convert it I got off the field on
third<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.980> obviously<00:00:38.790> where<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.000> went

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
third down obviously where they went

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.610 
third down obviously where they went
they<00:00:39.480> went<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.230> forth<00:00:40.500> their

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
they went for some you know forth their

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
they went for some you know forth their
conversions<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.879> successful<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
conversions and I was successful and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840 
conversions and I was successful and
some<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:42.899> uh<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.489> came

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
some but uh I think you know we all came

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.420 
some but uh I think you know we all came
out<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.120> play<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:46.079> sure<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:47.100> things

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
out to play I'm sure that is some things

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.619 
out to play I'm sure that is some things
that<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> mix<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.300> offend<00:00:48.480> but

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that we have to mix up don't offend but

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.790 
that we have to mix up don't offend but
ultimately<00:00:49.020> i<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.620> came<00:00:49.770> up

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
ultimately i think you know we came up

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
ultimately i think you know we came up
with<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.850> were<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> differences

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
with what were some of the differences

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
with what were some of the differences
to<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.140> between<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> first<00:00:52.829> half<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to you it between the first half and the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.360 
to you it between the first half and the
second<00:00:53.820> half<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:55.170> felt<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.890> though<00:00:56.010> date<00:00:56.160> they

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
second half I felt as though date they

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.029 
second half I felt as though date they
were<00:00:56.570> converting<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.829> he

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
were converting a little more and he

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.549 
were converting a little more and he
gave<00:00:59.190> us<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> little<00:00:59.489> bit<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.149> tempo<00:01:00.559> but

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
gave us a little bit more up tempo but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349

ball<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.740> better<00:04:00.920> but<00:04:01.190> no<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:01.910> did<00:04:02.090> what<00:04:02.210> we

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
ball of it better but no we did what we

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.870

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
half's it seemed like things were

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780
