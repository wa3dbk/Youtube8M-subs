00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hey, what are you talking about? 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.240
 This is the channel forza motosport brazuca 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 I will bring this second video is 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.820
 The series I'm doing with golf is in the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.270
 first part 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 I pointed to the false air outlet 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.650
 the side also made an extension until 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.200
 to wet with the stickers 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 If you stick to carbon fiber now I go 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.370
 show you how to make a ceiling 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.020
 very simple and fast solar and one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.239
 cool look for the car 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.090
 in the case of golf that does not have a sunroof 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.980
 This is what I'm doing there. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.309
 You take the sticker that has the edges 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.629
 rounded dimensions in size 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.440
 The ideal you think is copy and put 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 three and you just increasing the desire 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.369
 black on top in the second layer that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.680
 underneath the black you put a little 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.860
 bigger and in the third a little bigger 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 that 's how you 're going to get on a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 feeling deep and there you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.049
 the black then 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.530
 gray and then a lighter tone every time 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.860
 so take care that you do 10 to 10 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 example of this type is you have 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.240
 that is at 0 there you put 10 and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.250
 in the last layer puts 20 and you go 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.049
 have a sense of depth 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 maybe the video is not very visible 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:51.600
 but in the game you can see you are 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 Can you get this idea from me? 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.399
 principle that I do I put colors 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.360
 vibrant mainly red 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.100
 that you can get a sense of the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.450
 How much are you going to put the part of? 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.759
 Low higher than that at top 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 to have this part tackles with color 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.710
 different then always use one you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.300
 put the black adhesive 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.730
 It's the same size places red 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.770
 because when you increase 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.770
 sides you see you will get a notion 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.750
 of how much you are going to increase 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.350
 Then you'll put the colors 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.990
 what do you think you think 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.620
 necessary in my case I always put it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.540
 every 10 minutes to have this feeling of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.710
 depth and it's really cool if you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.990
 50 will put you in the next 60 places 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.640
 in the next 75 onwards 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.980
 each time you increase your 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.990
 sticker that 's underneath you if you 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.050
 can not understand 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.620
 I hope so, yes, I'm putting it there. 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.600
 I always wear this sticker , or I put it 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.790
 a vibrant color playing red there I 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.280
 I really have a sense of how I'm going. 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.750
 leave it and then chose the color it 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
 get better 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.490
 I chose a tone of gray as well 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.880
 close to black just to create this 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.740
 sense of reflection to give a realism 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.740
 greater not in the idea that it is the sunroof 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.690
 in the video I do not know the quality that goes 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.480
 being the video maybe you can not 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.740
 to notice more in the game 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.790
 I assure you that you will stay. 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.959
 very real and then a recommendation that I 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.300
 I do 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:43.170
 you make a ceiling group everything saves this 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.670
 group of layers because whenever you 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.280
 want you to have a car that does not 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.320
 have sunroof you just go there is already 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.030
 ready you only dimension also you 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.090
 want and you're only going to do it once 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.120
 in this case the sunroof as it is 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.800
 standard you can use in any car 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.340
 just gonna choose the size is everything 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.410
 right then you group saves lets 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.210
 except that whenever you needed 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.050
 be there 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.770
 I showed the side I made the side now 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.920
 I showed the ceiling in the next video I go 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:24.360
 show the part of the field that I've already 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.950
 I made an opening in the field there and went 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.370
 develop a picture on the internet 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.070
 I'll try that car engine. 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.070
 recreates the engine with 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.590
 put there underneath and that impression 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.500
 of which is open with motor support 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.830
 appearing will be the next video I will 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.070
 show it there 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.810
 If you liked the video of a like 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.320
 if you are not typed in the channel if 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.850
 I'll always post videos 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.250
 related shift and I hope you guys 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.790
 have liked and until the next video 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.790
 said
