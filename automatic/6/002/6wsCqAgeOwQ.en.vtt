00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.770
 Welcome to our channel 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 nail decoration today we are going to make a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.530
 very spring model to see more 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.059
 models you can enter our website www 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.059
 corner of patrick puntocom 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 let's make a couple of very little butterflies 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 funny and ideal for this spring 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:31.300
 we will be applying the transparent base 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.300
 that will give protection to our nail 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 let's paint the base of our nail 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.680
 White color 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 In this way , the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 butterflies that we have also chosen 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 we have to keep in mind that it is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 convenient to give a couple of layers so that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.670
 the color that uniform and the entire nail 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670
 well covered 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.140
 we started the design making four 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.409
 large dots in fuchsia color we will 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.930
 two up and two down and we're going to 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.930
 perform with a large size doping 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.689
 we continue making two dots a 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.869
 little smaller 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.880
 just stick to the big ones for it 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.880
 we use a medium size booty 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.770
 i 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:55.340
 Once dry it's more melting let's go 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.640
 making small dots in color 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.640
 light pink inside the fuchsia spots 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.210
 as you see in the video we are using 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.210
 a small size doping 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.430
 the head of the butterfly we're going to 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.980
 Do in black color and we will use 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.989
 a small size doping 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.650
 we will make a head to each of the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.650
 butterflies 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 the body of the butterfly will not be a 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.849
 finite hairline that we are going to do from the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 head to the end of the wings to 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.380
 we are making use of a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.420
 incentive 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550

 same fine brush doing two 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.570
 Peritoid strips on the head 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.340

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.819
