all as well take a look at that launch
one<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.679> time<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.819> what<00:01:20.999> they<00:01:21.119> call<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
one more time this is what they call a

you know the Indians have been in the

you know the Indians have been in the
space<00:01:29.969> business<00:01:30.270> since<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.929> early<00:01:31.170> 1960s

space business since the early 1960s

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.399 
space business since the early 1960s
they've<00:01:32.280> launched<00:01:32.639> all<00:01:32.759> kinds<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.409> satellites

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
they've launched all kinds of satellites

free the communications of scientific

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.629 
free the communications of scientific
purposes<00:01:36.749> but<00:01:37.499> this<00:01:37.679> is<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:37.889> big<00:01:38.130> deal

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
purposes but this is a big deal

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.440 
purposes but this is a big deal
leaving<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.109> bounds<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> Earth<00:01:41.249> gravity<00:01:41.969> is<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
leaving the bounds of Earth gravity is a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
leaving the bounds of Earth gravity is a
significant<00:01:43.409> step<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> puts<00:01:44.700> them

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
significant step and so this puts them

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.599 
significant step and so this puts them
on<00:01:45.179> a<00:01:45.209> literally<00:01:46.109> on<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.289> trajectory<00:01:46.609> toward

on a literally on a trajectory toward

on a literally on a trajectory toward

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
much bigger things in space and it is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440 
much bigger things in space and it is
their<00:01:50.039> stated<00:01:50.340> objective<00:01:50.999> although<00:01:51.270> it's

their stated objective although it's
they<00:01:51.539> don't<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:51.869> official<00:01:52.079> program<00:01:52.649> yet

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
they don't have an official program yet

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.340 
they don't have an official program yet
coach'll<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.729> put<00:01:53.969> human<00:01:54.420> beings<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.869> orbit<00:01:55.200> to

coach'll to put human beings in orbit to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
coach'll to put human beings in orbit to
have<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.709> own<00:01:55.950> manned<00:01:56.819> spacecraft<00:01:57.479> and

have their own manned spacecraft and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.269 
have their own manned spacecraft and
that<00:01:58.109> would<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.619> fourth<00:01:59.009> member

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
that would make them the fourth member

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:04.580 
that would make them the fourth member
of<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.539> elite<00:02:00.869> club<00:02:03.499> obviously<00:02:04.499> it

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
of that very elite club obviously it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.529 
of that very elite club obviously it
takes<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.829> lot<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> precise<00:02:05.459> maneuvering<00:02:06.240> there

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
takes a lot of precise maneuvering there

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.719 
takes a lot of precise maneuvering there
but<00:02:07.170> once<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.799> takes<00:02:08.009> off<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.490> looked<00:02:08.670> very

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
but once it takes off and it looked very

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.600 
but once it takes off and it looked very
successful<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.659> mean<00:02:09.869> when<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.129> find<00:02:11.370> out

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
successful I mean when do we find out

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.399 
successful I mean when do we find out
exactly<00:02:12.420> how<00:02:12.689> it<00:02:12.840> goes

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
exactly how it goes

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.600 
exactly how it goes
well<00:02:13.769> million<00:02:14.129> things<00:02:14.250> can

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610

to<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.780> moon<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.710> will<00:02:19.800> happen<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
to the moon what will happen now is it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.360 
to the moon what will happen now is it
will<00:02:20.880> establish<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.660> highly<00:02:22.380> elliptical<00:02:22.740> Earth

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
will establish a highly elliptical Earth

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.780 
will establish a highly elliptical Earth

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
a time it just right when they're ready

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.340 
a time it just right when they're ready
they're<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.000> fire<00:02:39.240> yet<00:02:39.600> another<00:02:39.840> rocket

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
they're going to fire yet another rocket

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.770 
they're going to fire yet another rocket
and<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:41.100> send<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.670> away<00:02:42.120> from<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and that will send it away from the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.590 
and that will send it away from the
Earth's<00:02:42.959> gravitational<00:02:43.680> pull<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.490> ever<00:02:45.209> so

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
Earth's gravitational pull and ever so

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.949 
Earth's gravitational pull and ever so
slowly<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.050> will<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.820> grabbed<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.390> will<00:02:48.600> by

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
slowly it will be grabbed if you will by

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.750 
slowly it will be grabbed if you will by
the<00:02:48.990> moon's<00:02:49.320> gravitational<00:02:50.220> pull<00:02:50.280> that'll

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the moon's gravitational pull that'll

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.949 
the moon's gravitational pull that'll
take<00:02:50.880> about<00:02:50.970> five<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.420> half<00:02:51.450> days<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.840> then

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
take about five and a half days and then

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.530 
take about five and a half days and then
as<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.230> gets<00:02:52.380> close<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> moon<00:02:53.209> it'll<00:02:54.209> fire

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
as it gets close to the moon it'll fire

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600 
as it gets close to the moon it'll fire
a<00:02:54.570> rocket<00:02:54.900> again<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.560> slow<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.920> down<00:02:55.950> just

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
a rocket again to slow it down just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.300 
a rocket again to slow it down just
enough<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.180> doesn't<00:02:57.270> crash<00:02:57.810> into<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.230> moon

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
enough so it doesn't crash into the moon

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.250 
enough so it doesn't crash into the moon
but<00:02:59.310> instead<00:02:59.670> goes<00:02:59.940> around<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.600> moon<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
but instead goes around the moon in a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.140 
but instead goes around the moon in a
nice<00:03:01.470> circular<00:03:02.160> orbit<00:03:02.580> about<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> hundred

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150

the<00:03:34.019> space<00:03:34.230> community<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> small<00:03:35.160> community

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the space community is a small community

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.280 
the space community is a small community
anyway<00:03:35.970> everybody<00:03:36.330> roots<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:36.989> each<00:03:37.080> other

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
anyway everybody roots for each other

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.320 
anyway everybody roots for each other
and<00:03:37.530> what<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.799> wishes<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.430> their<00:03:38.580> success<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
and what in wishes for their success and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.150 
and what in wishes for their success and
frankly<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.410> lot<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> people<00:03:40.890> at<00:03:40.950> NASA

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
frankly I think a lot of people at NASA

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.140 
frankly I think a lot of people at NASA
are<00:03:42.150> pleased<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.989> see<00:03:43.140> other<00:03:43.350> countries

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
are pleased to see other countries

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.820 
are pleased to see other countries
trying<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.299> catch<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.780> with<00:03:45.810> its<00:03:46.290> success

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
trying to catch up with its success

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.050 
trying to catch up with its success
because<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.530> hope<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.310> desire<00:03:50.670> inside

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
because it the hope is the desire inside

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.390 
because it the hope is the desire inside
NASA<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.709> will<00:03:52.830> spur<00:03:53.130> additional

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
NASA is that that will spur additional

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.449 
NASA is that that will spur additional
interest<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.299> NASA<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.690> potentially<00:03:55.590> lead<00:03:56.280> to

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
interest in NASA and potentially lead to

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.310 
interest in NASA and potentially lead to
additional<00:03:56.730> funding<00:03:57.330> for<00:03:57.480> its<00:03:57.690> programs<00:03:58.140> as

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
additional funding for its programs as

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.600 
additional funding for its programs as
it<00:03:58.380> stands<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.709> now<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.010> space<00:03:59.340> shuttle

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
it stands right now the space shuttle

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.520 
it stands right now the space shuttle
program<00:03:59.640> is<00:04:00.030> going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.330> away<00:04:00.480> at<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.410> end

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
program is going to go away at the end

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.830 
program is going to go away at the end
of<00:04:01.650> 2010<00:04:02.130> there's<00:04:02.700> going<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> be<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.030> five-year

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
of 2010 there's going to be a five-year

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.460 
of 2010 there's going to be a five-year
gap<00:04:04.140> where<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.940> US<00:04:06.660> will<00:04:06.900> not<00:04:07.080> have<00:04:07.320> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
gap where the US will not have the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.530 
gap where the US will not have the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
orbit at all well it might very well be

orbit at all well it might very well be
possible<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.239> at<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.049> end<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.440> gap<00:04:13.680> of

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
possible that at the end of that gap of

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
possible that at the end of that gap of
course<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.430> extends<00:04:14.850> out<00:04:15.000> there<00:04:15.570> could<00:04:15.840> be

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
course if it extends out there could be

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.080 
course if it extends out there could be
a<00:04:16.019> Chinese<00:04:16.560> flag<00:04:16.919> planted<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.640> moon<00:04:17.790> or

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
a Chinese flag planted in the moon or

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.569 
a Chinese flag planted in the moon or
the<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.780> Indians<00:04:19.260> might<00:04:19.470> be<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.040> orbit<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the the Indians might be in orbit and

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.490 
the the Indians might be in orbit and
thinking<00:04:21.000> about<00:04:21.150> doing<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.419> same<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.930> there

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
thinking about doing the same so there

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.230 
thinking about doing the same so there
in<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.740> way<00:04:22.890> there's<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.220> whole<00:04:23.460> new<00:04:23.640> space<00:04:23.940> race

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
in a way there's a whole new space race

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.850 
in a way there's a whole new space race
underway<00:04:24.720> it's<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.140> kind<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.380> emerging

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
underway it's just kind of emerging

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.260 
underway it's just kind of emerging
emerging

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
emerging

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.540 
emerging
and<00:04:28.169> miles<00:04:28.500> one<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.889> things<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and miles one of the things that the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.370 
and miles one of the things that the
Chandra<00:04:29.849> is<00:04:30.210> going<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.599> be<00:04:30.690> looking<00:04:30.960> for<00:04:31.110> aside

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
Chandra is going to be looking for aside

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.559 
Chandra is going to be looking for aside
from<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.710> water<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.310> ice<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.569> helium

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
from the water and the ice is helium

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.980 
from the water and the ice is helium
talked<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.520> importance<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.180> yeah

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
talked about the importance of that yeah

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.980 
talked about the importance of that yeah
well<00:04:37.259> this<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.069> make<00:04:38.250> your<00:04:38.430> voice

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
well this is not just to make your voice

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.870 
well this is not just to make your voice
high<00:04:39.990> or<00:04:40.259> to<00:04:40.440> raise<00:04:40.979> balloons<00:04:41.430> into<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.789> air

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
high or to raise balloons into the air

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.779 
high or to raise balloons into the air
we're<00:04:42.300> talking<00:04:42.599> about<00:04:42.690> helium-3<00:04:43.490> this<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.669> an

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
we're talking about helium-3 this is an

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.059 
we're talking about helium-3 this is an
extremely<00:04:45.330> rare<00:04:45.780> isotope<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.530> earth<00:04:46.710> but<00:04:46.949> it

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
extremely rare isotope on earth but it

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.129 
extremely rare isotope on earth but it
is<00:04:47.190> thought<00:04:47.729> to<00:04:47.789> be<00:04:47.940> plentiful<00:04:48.389> on<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.960> moon

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
is thought to be plentiful on the moon

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.640 
is thought to be plentiful on the moon
the<00:04:49.889> idea<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.819> could<00:04:51.090> fuel<00:04:51.509> a<00:04:51.900> fusion

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
the idea is that it could fuel a fusion

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.490 
the idea is that it could fuel a fusion
reaction<00:04:53.009> a<00:04:53.490> nuclear<00:04:54.150> fusion<00:04:54.599> reaction<00:04:55.349> which

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
reaction a nuclear fusion reaction which

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.719 
reaction a nuclear fusion reaction which
course<00:04:55.770> doesn't<00:04:56.009> create<00:04:56.160> anyways<00:04:56.520> which

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
course doesn't create anyways which

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.300 
course doesn't create anyways which
would<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.000> highly<00:04:57.530> efficient<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.650> could

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
would be highly efficient and could

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.710 
would be highly efficient and could
generate<00:04:59.699> tremendous<00:04:59.909> amounts<00:05:00.569> of<00:05:00.630> energy

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
generate tremendous amounts of energy

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.140 
generate tremendous amounts of energy
but<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.470> should<00:05:01.770> caution<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.220> there's<00:05:02.699> no<00:05:02.909> such

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
but I should caution you there's no such

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.270 
but I should caution you there's no such
thing<00:05:03.389> as<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.539> helium-3<00:05:03.990> fusion<00:05:04.650> reactor<00:05:05.130> it

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
thing as a helium-3 fusion reactor it

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.640 
thing as a helium-3 fusion reactor it
doesn't<00:05:05.669> exist<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.240> that's<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.169> bit<00:05:07.319> fanciful

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
doesn't exist so that's a bit fanciful

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.099 
doesn't exist so that's a bit fanciful
right<00:05:07.919> now
