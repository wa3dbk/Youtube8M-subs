00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.409
 we just found with him 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 communications career director 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.130
 look look there let's bother you a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 little baby 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.119
 hello mario how about how it feels 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.460
 steffen of good feels good very 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.130
 intense we are with several talks to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.310
 same time and the concept is just 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.740
 that communication just like 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.679
 educational careers are international 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.799
 there are guests from different experiences 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.659
 there are not different countries inclusive that 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.720
 that vision is giving us that vision 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.179
 that the postulant, let's say, should know 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.189
 the issues beyond that of what to 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.069
 times you see on television or listen to the 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.490
 radio and I think that's communication by 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.490
 the control 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.150
 How different this time it does not open 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.650
 have you seen in others to attend is good 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.939
 is betting a lot on the part 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.100
 international at the same time we have put 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.509
 enough effort is that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.950
 we want to bet our mind our 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.190
 agreements if our teachers 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.600
 travel guests stay the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.670
 directors to establish alliances 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.440
 with other universities other countries and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.450
 share our process methodology 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.200
 for methodologies that have university 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.200
 these minutes 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.150
 speaking more orally we know that 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.070
 There is a methodology methodology 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.870
 process that has this different 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 methodology with respect to the others 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 good universities is a methodology 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.750
 that develops creative thinking 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.090
 a creative moves the complex to what 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.850
 simple from reality to abstraction 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.890
 going through all that scale let's say 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.430
 grays then that's what the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.800
 methodology develop that capacity 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.200
 intellectual mentality in the students of 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 this university to move them from a 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.220
 side to side and this gives them a 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.380
 possibility of finding better 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.540
 solutions and think just outside of 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.160
 the box to the problems and challenges that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.360
 they will face in the future when 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 leave the unit 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.810
 I like best so far 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.150
 workshops that we are beginning to give 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.140
 by world the cities that we can give and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 see different perspectives are the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.020
 ways of looking at things and so can 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.010
 create more models 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.470
 a bite of the mind 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.439
 and I want to try to design and that everything 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.470
 world see what design means that it 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.510
 do something important or something like 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.939
 is is a creative music can express 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.590
 mostly what I really feel is 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.299
 the third time I come and I love 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.159
 everything I love infrastructure I read 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.360
 the courses that take me fascinates me 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.360
 that's why she writes to me 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.100
 Well the idea is to teach a little bit what is 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.210
 the ducal philosophy to be able 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.310
 work on creative processes a bit 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.380
 first a little fun 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.080
 logically and to see that you can 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.550
 create without need that this be a 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.550
 heavy or boring thing 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.300
