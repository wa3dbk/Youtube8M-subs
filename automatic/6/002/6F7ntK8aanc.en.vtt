the<00:01:11.700> lines<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.540> I'll<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.320> now

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the lines so I'll just do that right now

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.249 
the lines so I'll just do that right now
scale<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> fit<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.619> self-explanatory

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
scale to fit is pretty self-explanatory

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
scale to fit is pretty self-explanatory
you<00:01:19.259> put<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.590> dimensions<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> pixels<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you put in dimensions and pixels and it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
you put in dimensions and pixels and it
will<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:22.259> sure<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> image<00:01:22.920> fits<00:01:23.100> inside<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
will make sure the image fits inside of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.539 
will make sure the image fits inside of
a<00:01:23.820> box<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.530> size<00:01:26.100> well<00:01:26.310> being<00:01:26.460> as

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a box of that of that size well being as

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
a box of that of that size well being as
large<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.820> possible<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.960> 3,000

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
large as possible so if you put in 3,000

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
large as possible so if you put in 3,000
by<00:01:28.619> 2,000<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.820> make<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.150> long<00:01:30.420> side

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
by 2,000 it would make this long side

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.660 
by 2,000 it would make this long side
three<00:01:30.960> thousand<00:01:31.290> pixels<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> shorter

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
three thousand pixels in this shorter

three thousand pixels in this shorter
side<00:01:32.880> 2,000<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:33.930> 2,500<00:01:34.259> whatever<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> ratio

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

scaling tool that will scale the exact
dimensions<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.580> enter<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:27.770> let's<00:02:27.920> go<00:02:28.040> to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
dimensions you enter now let's go to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.730 
dimensions you enter now let's go to
filters<00:02:28.990> before<00:02:29.990> we<00:02:30.080> start<00:02:30.290> applying<00:02:30.530> these

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
filters before we start applying these

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.590 
filters before we start applying these
I'm<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.190> going<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.460> go<00:02:32.000> into<00:02:32.150> my<00:02:32.300> history

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
I'm just going to go into my history

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.880 
I'm just going to go into my history
here<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:33.260> everything<00:02:33.620> we've<00:02:33.740> done

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
here you can see everything we've done

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.860 
here you can see everything we've done
so<00:02:33.950> far<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:35.210> back<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.570> beginning

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
so far and just go back to the beginning

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.800 
so far and just go back to the beginning
and<00:02:36.290> tap<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.880> revert<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.510> initial

and tap on that to revert to the initial

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.090 
and tap on that to revert to the initial
state<00:02:40.030> let's<00:02:41.030> look<00:02:41.150> at<00:02:41.300> brightness<00:02:41.600> contrast

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
state let's look at brightness contrast

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.650 
state let's look at brightness contrast
so<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.160> see<00:02:43.610> we<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.850> these<00:02:43.970> sliders<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.570> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
so you see we have these sliders on the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.210 
so you see we have these sliders on the
side<00:02:44.840> most<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.410> filters<00:02:45.740> use<00:02:45.950> these

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
side most of the filters use these

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.360 
side most of the filters use these
sliders<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:48.230> pull<00:02:48.950> them<00:02:49.070> up<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
sliders you can just pull them up and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.930 
sliders you can just pull them up and
down<00:02:49.990> you'll<00:02:50.990> get<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> preview<00:02:51.730> many<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.880> the

filters<00:02:53.240> have<00:02:53.390> live<00:02:53.570> preview<00:02:53.990> some<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.290> them

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
filters have live preview some of them

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.210 
filters have live preview some of them
you<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.940> once<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.120> release<00:02:56.420> your<00:02:57.220> finger

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
to first set the curves for the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.410 
to first set the curves for the
background<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.680> image<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.100> sky<00:03:31.370> um<00:03:31.640> if

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
you don't know how to use curves there

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.400 
you don't know how to use curves there
is<00:03:33.830> some<00:03:34.010> text<00:03:34.190> documentation<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:36.050> the

in the video so I suggest you read it
I'm<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> change<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.600> RGB<00:03:45.380> curves

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
I'm going to change this to RGB curves

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.370 
I'm going to change this to RGB curves
going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> tap<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.360> Add<00:03:47.510> point<00:03:47.810> button<00:03:48.050> then

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
going to tap the Add point button then

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.199 
going to tap the Add point button then
tap<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.920> curve<00:03:49.459> control<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.970> add<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
tap on the curve control to add the

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.560 
tap on the curve control to add the
point<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.860> this<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.100> about<00:03:52.190> what<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.489> want<00:03:52.790> but

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
point so this is about what I want but

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.350 
point so this is about what I want but
you<00:03:53.690> can<00:03:53.840> see<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.140> uh<00:03:54.380> if<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.880> what<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.209> do

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
then I lose all the details in the sky

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.430 
then I lose all the details in the sky
divers<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.850> don't<00:04:02.060> want<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.300> do<00:04:02.390> that<00:04:02.440> so

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
divers and I don't want to do that so

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
what I'm going to do is instead of using

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.170 
what I'm going to do is instead of using
the<00:04:07.489> apply<00:04:07.820> button<00:04:08.620> I'm<00:04:09.620> going<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.160> use<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
the apply button I'm going to use the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.930 
the apply button I'm going to use the
mask<00:04:11.690> button<00:04:12.020> here<00:04:12.520> so<00:04:13.520> one<00:04:13.640> with<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.820> picture

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
mask button here so one with the picture

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.280 
mask button here so one with the picture
of<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.180> brush

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
of a brush

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.569 
of a brush
and<00:04:15.409> we<00:04:16.130> enter<00:04:16.370> our<00:04:16.400> masking<00:04:16.910> mode<00:04:17.829> so<00:04:18.829> now<00:04:19.519> we

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and we enter our masking mode so now we

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.819 
and we enter our masking mode so now we
can<00:04:19.880> use<00:04:20.239> all<00:04:20.959> these<00:04:21.139> masking<00:04:21.500> tools<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.799> have

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
can use all these masking tools you have

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.980 
can use all these masking tools you have
brushes<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.639> various<00:04:23.270> things<00:04:23.300> which<00:04:23.750> I'll<00:04:23.840> go

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
brushes and various things which I'll go

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.279 
brushes and various things which I'll go
into<00:04:24.139> right<00:04:24.320> now<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> first<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.229> is

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
into right now so the first one is

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.029 
into right now so the first one is
simply<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.850> lets<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.210> swipe<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.020> zoom<00:04:30.860> in

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
simply it lets you swipe and zoom in

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.650 
simply it lets you swipe and zoom in
like<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.400> freely<00:04:31.910> without<00:04:32.000> editing<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
like that freely without editing the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.620 
like that freely without editing the
image<00:04:32.740> second<00:04:33.740> one<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.070> brush<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.360> set

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
image second one is the brush we can set

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.980 
image second one is the brush we can set
the<00:04:36.259> hardness<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.889> brush<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
the hardness of the brush and the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.310 
the hardness of the brush and the
opacity<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:41.060> size<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.870> will<00:04:41.990> scale

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
opacity and the size and it will scale

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.980 
opacity and the size and it will scale
few<00:04:42.979> zoom<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:43.550> it's<00:04:43.669> if<00:04:44.360> it's<00:04:44.479> big<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:44.930> i

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
few zoom in so if it's if it's big and i

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.140 
few zoom in so if it's if it's big and i
zoom<00:04:45.229> in<00:04:45.380> it'll<00:04:45.830> be<00:04:46.190> slightly<00:04:46.550> smaller<00:04:46.910> when<00:04:47.120> i

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
zoom in it'll be slightly smaller when i

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.950 
zoom in it'll be slightly smaller when i
zoom<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:51.070> let's<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:52.250> erase<00:04:52.370> all<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.759> those<00:04:52.960> no

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
zoom in let's just erase all of those no

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.629 
zoom in let's just erase all of those no
because<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.440> didn't<00:04:54.650> want<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.830> do<00:04:54.979> any<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.190> that

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.700 

the<00:04:58.639> gradient<00:04:58.849> tool<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:02.810> have<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> bunch<00:05:03.590> of

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
the gradient tool I have a bunch of

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.960 
the gradient tool I have a bunch of
different<00:05:03.770> sorts<00:05:04.639> of<00:05:04.729> gradients<00:05:05.710> circular

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
different sorts of gradients circular

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.999 
different sorts of gradients circular
and<00:05:07.970> various<00:05:08.419> linear<00:05:08.810> gradients<00:05:11.979> save<00:05:12.979> that

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
and various linear gradients save that

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.860 
and various linear gradients save that
for<00:05:13.310> later<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> color<00:05:14.300> range<00:05:14.570> tool

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
for later this is a color range tool

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.200 
for later this is a color range tool
it'll<00:05:15.710> select<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.250> color<00:05:16.430> beneath<00:05:16.789> this<00:05:16.940> loop

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
it'll select the color beneath this loop

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.029 
it'll select the color beneath this loop
and<00:05:17.449> it<00:05:17.960> will<00:05:18.050> apply<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.380> adjustments<00:05:18.949> to

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
and it will apply the adjustments to

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.560 
and it will apply the adjustments to
everything<00:05:19.370> that's<00:05:19.669> similar<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.150> that<00:05:20.330> color

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
everything that's similar to that color

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.870 
everything that's similar to that color
so<00:05:21.199> here<00:05:21.979> I<00:05:22.010> guess<00:05:22.159> mostly<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.520> parachute

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
so here I guess mostly the parachute

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.450 
so here I guess mostly the parachute
here<00:05:23.030> gets<00:05:23.180> mostly<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.510> sky<00:05:24.130> also<00:05:25.130> not<00:05:25.280> going

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
here gets mostly the sky also not going

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.930 
here gets mostly the sky also not going
to<00:05:25.550> use<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.699> right<00:05:25.970> now<00:05:27.400> pacity<00:05:28.400> tool<00:05:28.580> this

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
to use that right now pacity tool this

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.060 
to use that right now pacity tool this
is<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.120> simple<00:05:29.360> slider<00:05:32.470> vignette<00:05:33.470> tool<00:05:33.710> allows

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
is a simple slider vignette tool allows

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.029 
is a simple slider vignette tool allows
you<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.370> apply<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.870> vignette<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:36.050> circular

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
you to apply a vignette a circular

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.830 
you to apply a vignette a circular
vignette<00:05:37.310> as<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.610> mask<00:05:37.820> can<00:05:38.389> set<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.659> fall

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
vignette as the mask can set the fall

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.750 
vignette as the mask can set the fall
off<00:05:41.470> but<00:05:42.470> what<00:05:42.710> I<00:05:42.740> do<00:05:42.830> want<00:05:42.949> to<00:05:43.130> do<00:05:43.280> is<00:05:43.430> you<00:05:43.460> go

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
off but what I do want to do is you go

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.339 
off but what I do want to do is you go
back<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.060> gradient<00:05:44.510> tool<00:05:44.539> and<00:05:44.960> use<00:05:45.139> this

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
back to the gradient tool and use this

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.060 
back to the gradient tool and use this
inverse<00:05:46.270> circular<00:05:47.270> gradient<00:05:47.860> set<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:48.949> there

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
inverse circular gradient set it there

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.500 
inverse circular gradient set it there
so<00:05:49.280> we<00:05:49.340> get<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.490> nice<00:05:49.729> fading<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.449> the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
so we get this nice fading and the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.600 
so we get this nice fading and the
bright<00:05:51.139> point<00:05:51.530> is<00:05:51.710> near<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.070> focal<00:05:52.370> point<00:05:52.400> of

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
bright point is near the focal point of

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.300 
bright point is near the focal point of
the<00:05:52.729> image<00:05:52.909> which<00:05:53.090> is<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.330> we<00:05:53.419> want<00:05:53.599> so<00:05:54.560> we'll

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
the image which is what we want so we'll

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.930 
the image which is what we want so we'll
just<00:05:55.340> go<00:05:55.789> ahead<00:05:55.909> and<00:05:56.060> add<00:05:56.389> that<00:05:56.720> to<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.930> mask

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
just go ahead and add that to the mask

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.370 
just go ahead and add that to the mask
that'll<00:05:58.940> zoom<00:05:59.180> in<00:05:59.360> here<00:05:59.389> and<00:05:59.930> just<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.349> make

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
that'll zoom in here and just to make

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.370 
that'll zoom in here and just to make
sure<00:06:00.530> that<00:06:01.039> they<00:06:01.699> don't<00:06:01.820> get<00:06:02.030> too<00:06:02.900> dark<00:06:03.080> i'm

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
sure that they don't get too dark i'm

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.830 
sure that they don't get too dark i'm
just<00:06:03.560> going<00:06:03.770> to<00:06:04.060> quickly<00:06:05.060> erase<00:06:05.539> it<00:06:05.720> a<00:06:05.750> little

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
just going to quickly erase it a little

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.050 
just going to quickly erase it a little
bit<00:06:06.050> from<00:06:06.139> them<00:06:06.349> just<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:07.010> keep<00:06:07.669> things<00:06:07.729> a<00:06:07.970> bit

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
bit from them just to keep things a bit

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.040 
bit from them just to keep things a bit
brighter

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
brighter

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.670 
brighter
multiply<00:06:10.650> that<00:06:15.020> now<00:06:16.020> let's<00:06:16.199> go<00:06:16.319> back<00:06:16.349> into<00:06:16.620> the

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
multiply that now let's go back into the

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.680 
multiply that now let's go back into the
curves<00:06:16.979> and<00:06:17.190> this<00:06:17.340> time<00:06:17.550> instead<00:06:17.879> of<00:06:18.090> going

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
curves and this time instead of going

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.040 
curves and this time instead of going
for<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.870> background<00:06:19.349> i'm<00:06:19.620> going<00:06:20.039> to<00:06:21.050> use

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
for the background i'm going to use

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.950 
for the background i'm going to use
luminance<00:06:22.500> curves<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:22.979> set<00:06:23.159> it<00:06:23.280> for<00:06:23.960> the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
luminance curves and set it for the

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.510 
luminance curves and set it for the
parachute<00:06:25.440> just<00:06:25.620> make<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:25.770> really<00:06:25.889> contrast

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
parachute just make it really contrast

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.809 
parachute just make it really contrast
you<00:06:26.669> like<00:06:26.819> that<00:06:27.060> now<00:06:27.690> make<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.960> pop<00:06:28.550> so<00:06:29.550> I'll

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
you like that now make it pop so I'll

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.390 
you like that now make it pop so I'll
just<00:06:29.849> go<00:06:30.270> back<00:06:30.449> to<00:06:30.479> my<00:06:30.629> masking<00:06:31.110> tools<00:06:31.340> go<00:06:32.340> to

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
just go back to my masking tools go to

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.310 
doing this on the simulator which will

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.040 
doing this on the simulator which will
process<00:08:06.520> it<00:08:06.699> much<00:08:06.940> faster<00:08:07.090> because<00:08:07.419> computers

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050 
process it much faster because computers

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.010 
process it much faster because computers
much<00:08:08.469> faster<00:08:08.889> but<00:08:09.490> it's<00:08:09.669> not<00:08:10.000> too<00:08:10.150> bad<00:08:10.300> and

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.020 
much faster but it's not too bad and

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.899 
much faster but it's not too bad and
it'll<00:08:11.289> so<00:08:11.919> now<00:08:12.069> it's<00:08:12.219> safe<00:08:12.400> to<00:08:12.520> the<00:08:12.610> library

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:12.909

it'll so now it's safe to the library
it's<00:08:13.120> brought<00:08:13.300> up<00:08:13.389> the<00:08:13.509> email<00:08:13.719> sheet<00:08:13.990> and
