00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
card slot and the battery compartment
here<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.630> fact<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.199> use

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
here I don't like the fact that they use

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.819 
here I don't like the fact that they use
the<00:00:31.859> camera<00:00:32.489> itself<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> charging<00:00:33.829> platform

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the camera itself as a charging platform

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.290 
the camera itself as a charging platform
there<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> no<00:00:35.280> external<00:00:35.489> battery<00:00:35.940> charger<00:00:36.270> for

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
there is no external battery charger for

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.020 
there is no external battery charger for
the<00:00:36.570> rx100<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.820> would<00:00:38.940> have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the rx100 that I know of it would have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
the rx100 that I know of it would have
been<00:00:39.120> nice<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.500> extra

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
been nice that way you can have extra

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
been nice that way you can have extra
batteries<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.340> hand<00:00:41.670> charging<00:00:42.180> while<00:00:42.360> you're

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
batteries on hand charging while you're

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
batteries on hand charging while you're
using<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> camera<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> guess<00:00:45.000> they

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
using the camera but I guess they

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.110 
using the camera but I guess they
probably<00:00:45.570> did<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.350> save<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.920> space<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
probably did that to save on space and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
probably did that to save on space and
one<00:00:48.329> less<00:00:48.510> accessory<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> lose<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.800> in

yeah<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.700> pretty<00:02:59.880> nice<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.390> got<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> lot<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
yeah it's pretty nice it's got a lot of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.490 
yeah it's pretty nice it's got a lot of
high-end<00:03:01.560> features<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.819> shoots<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
high-end features I think it shoots a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500 
high-end features I think it shoots a
three<00:03:04.500> shot<00:03:04.530> HDR<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.220> JPEG<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.940> also<00:03:06.090> has<00:03:06.329> what

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
three shot HDR and JPEG it also has what

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.990 
three shot HDR and JPEG it also has what
the<00:03:06.569> called<00:03:06.750> dro<00:03:07.250> dinette<00:03:08.250> did<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.790> make<00:03:08.970> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the called dro dinette did I make a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.630 
the called dro dinette did I make a
range<00:03:09.299> optimization<00:03:10.260> mode<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:14.010> pretty<00:03:14.519> yeah

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
range optimization mode it's pretty yeah

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.910 
range optimization mode it's pretty yeah
it's<00:03:14.790> pretty<00:03:14.910> good<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:15.209> camera<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.920> kind

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
it's pretty good for camera that's kind

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's pretty good for camera that's kind
of<00:03:17.010> spendy<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.609> what<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.850> pay<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.299> think<00:03:20.630> it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
of spendy for what you pay I think it's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.449 
of spendy for what you pay I think it's
priced<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:22.019> little<00:03:22.200> higher<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.799> understand

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
priced a little higher and I understand

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.280 
priced a little higher and I understand
why<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.639> has<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> large<00:03:24.359> sensor<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:24.930> but<00:03:25.170> there

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
why it has a large sensor now but there

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.940 
why it has a large sensor now but there
are<00:03:25.489> other<00:03:26.489> cameras<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.660> are<00:03:27.720> gonna<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
are other cameras that are gonna be a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.379 
are other cameras that are gonna be a
little<00:03:29.220> more<00:03:29.370> affordable<00:03:29.819> like<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.299> LX<00:03:30.720> 7<00:03:31.139> or

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
little more affordable like the LX 7 or

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.180 
little more affordable like the LX 7 or
the<00:03:33.410> s100<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.530> course<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:34.799> don't<00:03:34.889> have<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the s100 of course they don't have the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.280 
the s100 of course they don't have the
large<00:03:35.430> sensor<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.150> puppy<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:36.989> this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
large sensor that this puppy is this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.890 
large sensor that this puppy is this
pop-up<00:03:37.530> flash<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.100> pretty<00:03:38.310> interesting<00:03:38.900> pops

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
pop-up flash is pretty interesting pops

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.420 
pop-up flash is pretty interesting pops
up<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.319> leans<00:03:40.500> back<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.069> if<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.220> want<00:03:41.370> to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
up and leans back so if you want to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.979 
up and leans back so if you want to
bounce<00:03:41.639> it<00:03:41.880> off<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.030> ceiling<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.720> don't<00:03:42.900> know

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
bounce it off the ceiling I don't know

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.660 
bounce it off the ceiling I don't know
how<00:03:43.440> much<00:03:43.560> bounce<00:03:43.889> you'd<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.190> doing<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.549> this

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
how much bounce you'd be doing on this

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.770 
how much bounce you'd be doing on this
tiny<00:03:44.970> tiny<00:03:46.010> thumbnail<00:03:47.010> flash<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
tiny tiny thumbnail flash but it's a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.660 
tiny tiny thumbnail flash but it's a
thoughtful<00:03:49.019> feature

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.850 

so<00:03:52.240> is<00:03:52.360> there<00:03:52.480> worth<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.900> premium<00:03:53.170> price<00:03:53.590> like

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
so is there worth the premium price like

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.790 
so is there worth the premium price like
this<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.280> commands<00:03:54.970> I'm<00:03:55.840> not<00:03:56.140> sure<00:03:56.380> for<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
this the commands I'm not sure for the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.140 
this the commands I'm not sure for the
same<00:03:56.980> price<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.550> get<00:03:57.730> an<00:03:57.850> entry-level

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
same price you can get an entry-level

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.110
