00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
need is some cardboard and some paint so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.169 
need is some cardboard and some paint so
let's<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.590> many<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:13.950> projects<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.910> first

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
let's like many of my projects the first

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.480 
let's like many of my projects the first
step<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.719> really<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:16.949> concept

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
step is really just to get some concept

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.540 
step is really just to get some concept
art<00:00:17.640> down<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.710> been<00:00:19.859> drawing<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.310> few

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
art down so I've been drawing a few

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.490 
art down so I've been drawing a few
helmets<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.689> idea<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> want<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
helmets to get an idea of what I want to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
helmets to get an idea of what I want to
make<00:00:22.650> using<00:00:23.369> some<00:00:24.050> inspiration<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
make using some inspiration from the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.630 
make using some inspiration from the
internet<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.710> sort<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.519> I'm

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
internet and this is sort of what I'm

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.790 
internet and this is sort of what I'm
thinking<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:31.790> making<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.800> cylindrical

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
thinking of making like a cylindrical

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:47.540 
thinking of making like a cylindrical
helmet<00:00:36.530> with<00:00:37.530> these<00:00:38.360> blocks<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:41.040> go<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:46.550> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
helmet with these blocks to go over like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.490 
helmet with these blocks to go over like
that<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:54.360> form<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:55.160> space<00:00:56.160> between<00:00:56.640> them

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
that that form a space between them

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.490 
that that form a space between them
it's<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> eye<00:00:58.770> holes<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> be

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's where the eye holes are going to be

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's where the eye holes are going to be
so<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.680> sort<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so that's sort of what I'm gonna go for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
so that's sort of what I'm gonna go for
you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.930> I've<00:01:03.989> taken<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> piece<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you can see that I've taken a piece of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
you can see that I've taken a piece of
cardboard<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.640> made<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> cylinder<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
cardboard and made a cylinder out of it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.810 
cardboard and made a cylinder out of it
as<00:01:06.930> well<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.290> drawing<00:01:07.619> lines<00:01:08.040> where<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:08.610> eyes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
as well as drawing lines where my eyes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
as well as drawing lines where my eyes
go<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:11.150> next<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> cut<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> glued<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> more

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
go out next I cut out and glued a more

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
go out next I cut out and glued a more
curved<00:01:13.770> strip<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.189> cardboard<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> top

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
curved strip of cardboard for the top

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.109 
curved strip of cardboard for the top
rim<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.990> I've<00:01:16.200> cut<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.950> entire

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
rim here I've cut out the entire

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
rim here I've cut out the entire
faceplate<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.780> cover<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.380> with

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
faceplate and I'm going to cover it with

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
faceplate and I'm going to cover it with
some<00:01:20.130> blocks<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> front<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
some blocks on the front now here you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.240 
some blocks on the front now here you
can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> I've<00:01:22.890> made<00:01:23.689> five<00:01:24.689> slats<00:01:25.290> four

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
can see that I've made five slats four

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
can see that I've made five slats four
of<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.580> cover<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.479> hole<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.080> cut<00:01:28.290> out

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of them cover that hole that I cut out

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
of them cover that hole that I cut out
earlier<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> fifth<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.039 
earlier and the fifth one is just on the
top<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.290> made<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> cardboard<00:01:32.180> shape<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.630> cap

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
top I then made a cardboard shape to cap

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.590 
top I then made a cardboard shape to cap
off<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.500> top<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> both<00:01:35.939> hold<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
head from poking through the top for the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
head from poking through the top for the
first<00:01:42.360> step<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> painting<00:01:43.200> process

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
