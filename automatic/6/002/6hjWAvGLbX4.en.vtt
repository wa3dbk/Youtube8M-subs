against<00:01:12.600> us<00:01:12.750> maybe<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> wouldn't<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> victim<00:01:14.010> up

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

a very very solid team here it just has
pretty<00:01:18.180> bad<00:01:18.509> chemistry<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.710> know<00:01:19.770> why

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
pretty bad chemistry I don't know why

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
pretty bad chemistry I don't know why
people<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.820> pick

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
people do that you think would pick

people do that you think would pick
players<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> song<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.350> quite

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
players like that song would know quite

a lot about fee for a know about

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
a lot about fee for a know about
chemistry<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.630> good<00:01:24.810> chemistry

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
chemistry and how to get good chemistry

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
chemistry and how to get good chemistry
but<00:01:25.470> apparently<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.580> guy<00:01:26.820> did<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.659> are

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
chances that we just couldn't really

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.949 
chances that we just couldn't really

chances<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:15.360> players<00:03:15.600> wouldn't<00:03:15.840> finish<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
chances my players wouldn't finish and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.440 
chances my players wouldn't finish and
then<00:03:16.830> he'd<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.130> one<00:03:17.340> chance<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.760> score<00:03:18.000> every

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
couldn't seem to put it away and I think

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.400 
couldn't seem to put it away and I think
maybe<00:03:21.239> because<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> didn't<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.019> lung<00:03:22.230> but

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
maybe because I didn't have lung but

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.750 
maybe because I didn't have lung but

could have got show her I did have
enough<00:04:10.750> coins<00:04:10.959> but<00:04:11.140> like<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.319> said<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.560> want<00:04:11.709> to

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
enough coins but like I said I want to

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.770

advance<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.549> team<00:04:12.760> gradually<00:04:13.329> so<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.599> for

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
advance of the team gradually so it for

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.449 
advance of the team gradually so it for
really<00:04:13.989> hopefully<00:04:14.769> he's<00:04:14.860> gonna<00:04:14.920> do<00:04:15.159> a<00:04:15.190> little

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
really hopefully he's gonna do a little

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.650 
really hopefully he's gonna do a little
bit<00:04:15.610> better<00:04:15.790> than<00:04:16.000> green<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.329> think<00:04:16.540> he's

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
bit better than green I think he's

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.500 
bit better than green I think he's
slightly<00:04:16.959> higher<00:04:17.799> rated<00:04:18.459> their<00:04:18.609> greens<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.030> 76

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
slightly higher rated their greens at 76

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.390 
slightly higher rated their greens at 76
and<00:04:19.660> really<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.079> 78<00:04:20.889> we<00:04:21.100> don't<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.340> a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
and really is a 78 we don't have a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.980 
and really is a 78 we don't have a
massive<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:22.090> choice<00:04:22.360> when<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.720> comes<00:04:22.780> two

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
massive a choice when it comes two

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.300 
massive a choice when it comes two
goalkeepers<00:04:23.169> especially<00:04:23.800> in<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:24.039> England

him<00:05:27.039> from<00:05:27.130> doing<00:05:27.310> that<00:05:27.520> was<00:05:27.669> very<00:05:27.820> very<00:05:28.060> very

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
him from doing that was very very very

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.320 
him from doing that was very very very
very<00:05:29.169> nice<00:05:29.470> for<00:05:29.919> me<00:05:30.099> and<00:05:30.340> again<00:05:30.789> we<00:05:30.880> get<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.060> nice

very nice for me and again we get a nice

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.760 
very nice for me and again we get a nice
chance<00:05:31.720> here<00:05:31.900> planning<00:05:32.289> for<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.440> dog<00:05:32.560> walker

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
chance here planning for a dog walker

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.350 
chance here planning for a dog walker
who's<00:05:33.039> already<00:05:33.310> got<00:05:33.430> looking<00:05:33.820> ass<00:05:33.940> if<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.270> the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
who's already got looking ass if to the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.540 
who's already got looking ass if to the
team<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.840> he<00:05:35.229> gets<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.560> goal<00:05:35.800> in<00:05:36.039> this<00:05:36.160> game<00:05:36.370> so

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
team and he gets a goal in this game so

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.370 
team and he gets a goal in this game so
a<00:05:36.789> really<00:05:37.210> really<00:05:37.389> solid<00:05:37.570> choice<00:05:37.900> at<00:05:38.080> right<00:05:38.260> by

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
a really really solid choice at right by

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.510 
a really really solid choice at right by
that<00:05:38.500> Kyle<00:05:38.710> Walker<00:05:38.919> I<00:05:39.039> didn't<00:05:39.250> think<00:05:39.400> he'd<00:05:39.490> be

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
that Kyle Walker I didn't think he'd be

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.850 
that Kyle Walker I didn't think he'd be
that<00:05:39.820> good<00:05:40.120> he<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.810> very<00:05:41.139> very<00:05:41.289> attacking<00:05:41.590> know

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
that good he is very very attacking know

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.990 
that good he is very very attacking know
so<00:05:42.010> I<00:05:42.039> think<00:05:42.099> if<00:05:42.310> I<00:05:42.430> had<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.610> more<00:05:42.849> attacking

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
so I think if I had a more attacking

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.969 
so I think if I had a more attacking
right<00:05:43.360> mid<00:05:43.510> i<00:05:43.599> would<00:05:43.720> probably<00:05:43.960> notice<00:05:44.289> a<00:05:44.500> lot

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
right mid i would probably notice a lot

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.800 
right mid i would probably notice a lot
more<00:05:45.099> gaps<00:05:45.280> but<00:05:45.490> lallana's<00:05:45.940> tends<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.599> track

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
more gaps but lallana's tends to track

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.110 
more gaps but lallana's tends to track
back<00:05:47.050> on<00:05:47.080> occasions<00:05:48.010> as<00:05:48.099> well<00:05:48.250> which<00:05:48.400> does<00:05:48.639> how

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
back on occasions as well which does how

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.689 
back on occasions as well which does how
bad<00:05:49.360> was<00:05:49.510> he<00:05:49.800> leveled<00:05:50.800> up<00:05:50.830> there<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.250> two<00:05:51.460> and

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
bad was he leveled up there to two and

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.520 
bad was he leveled up there to two and
then<00:05:51.789> cleverly<00:05:52.389> smashes<00:05:53.050> another<00:05:53.320> one<00:05:53.440> in

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
then cleverly smashes another one in

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.500 
then cleverly smashes another one in
like<00:05:54.190> I<00:05:54.340> said<00:05:54.520> playing<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:54.880> can<00:05:55.090> hopefully<00:05:55.330> see

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
like I said playing it can hopefully see

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.270 
like I said playing it can hopefully see
and<00:05:55.780> do<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> lot<00:05:56.139> better<00:05:56.260> for<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.590> wasn't

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
and do a lot better for as I wasn't

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.160 
and do a lot better for as I wasn't
aberthol<00:05:58.060> was<00:05:58.360> like<00:05:58.480> oh<00:05:58.600> god<00:05:58.780> this<00:05:58.900> formation
