00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello how about youtube friends talk to you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.740
 your friend is light up and today I love you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.260
 teach how to repair an epson printer 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.260
 who has problems in the scanner 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.720
 this is what this printer does and 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.710
 This problem is very common in the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.360
 epson printers what happens is that the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.360
 scanner stays stuck 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.430
 it only makes like it advances but there 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.880
 it is bouncing 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.240
 it starts to thunder 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.010
 and the detail of this problem both 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.489
 it could be our scanner 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.530
 it could be our logical card but 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 most likely it is our cable 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.469
 flex then at the end it throws us to a 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.300
 general problem then I will proceed 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.140
 to open the printer to change the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.260
 cable 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.660
 me here I have my flex cable those wires 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.910
 you can not get new ones in this 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.880
 case I got it with a friend from another 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.890
 printer the first thing we have to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 remove are these two screws that 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.580
 we have here 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.070
 the potato 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.120
 from this part of the cellar recording here 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.890
 please call something else 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.890
 we have to withdraw this stage 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.250
 and here we have a screw from the top 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.860
 there are four screws the neighbors 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.740
 in the unity of the desire 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.850
 and in the part of up here 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.850
 in this part of here 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.159
 we have some clips we have a 30 here 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.220
 all clips in this part 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.220
 soft 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.850
 the panel 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.030
 and here inside we have another screw 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 and keep removing all the screws is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.590
 a 4 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.280
 34 we have another clip that is more or 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.280
 less around here 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.830
 then we press them there is one here and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 There is another letter we press for good 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.240
 well 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.840
 normally we open it from this side to 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.840
 do this 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.800
 as I said the problem of those scales 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.940
 Normally it will be our cable 3 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.010
 in this case what I 'm going to do now is 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.010
 open the scanner to change it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:27.190
 already having in the work of the scanner 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.190
 also in addition on only 24 screws 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.890
 since we remove the screws too 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.980
 let's locate the clips that have 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:56.990
 has several sides of 123 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.990
 then we place them all live them 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.209
 and 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.150
 and we have 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.120
 I tell them the program can be so much 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.080
 which it is the unit of the scanner or cable 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.720
 or the logical card but I tell them the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.850
 most common failure is that it is the cables of 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.540
 done me here I was trying to 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.670
 fix it but I could not then with a 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.620
 multimeter what you have to do is 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.900
 measure continuity here for what 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.660
 to be totally sure that it's your 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.060
 lime in this case I already assured me that it is 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.330
 my cable and I'm going to change it to see if 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.160
 works 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.290
 to remove the flex change 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.890
 we just have to disconnect it from 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.890
 this side 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.630
 in this part of this part of here 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.630
 has glue on your instrument 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.190
 here 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.530
 then supposedly that canon is 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.530
 say let's go 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.520
 then this one here does not have to pass 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.090
 because the time that he is moving 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.890
 the scanner we will have the workshop 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.890
 we have to take care of it in such a way that 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.590
 more or less like that 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.590
 Y 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.090
 if we see that many people get up from here 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.630
 we can put practice tape so that 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.630
 Do it 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.610
 good friends I just put together the printer 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.629
 just put the scanner 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.309
 indeed you can see what it is 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.070
 the cable that is going to change by the 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:49.480
 tape that was put to see there 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:53.140
 here I have the other cable that changes 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:57.250
 I was trying to repair this I had 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:00.340
 when that happens in points 1 you can 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.590
 try to repair it by peeling the tip to 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.799
 see if it works but it's very stems 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.679
 So I will not pull through or 

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:11.269
 and then we have it armed now 

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.989
 let's proceed to do the test to see 

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:13.989
 yes it works 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.700
 good to start we saw that it has not 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.010
 made no movement of scale and 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 we saw that it ignited but already thundering 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:38.320
 and we see that it no longer throws us what it is 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:41.500
 the general error 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.820
 then as you can see 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.730
 normally that problem is corrected 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.689
 changing the flex cable to any doubt 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.360
 or comment do not hesitate 

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:55.529
 to comment and I will be able to help 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.529
 to review the earrings
