00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello, let's try to calculate 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.099
 the value of expression 3 multiplied by 32 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.050
 let's write a little differently 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.610
 above we will have a larger number in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 In this case, it is 32 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 and the bottom will be a smaller number is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.439
 single digit 3 it consists of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 single digit digits 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 write a three under the discharge units 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.189
 numbers 32 here and of course not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 forget the multiplication signs 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 this is just another entry 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.390
 of this expression we multiply 32 by 3 a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's the same as multiplying 3 by 32 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 no matter how we rearrange the multipliers in 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 the product of the value of the product from 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 it doesnâ€™t change about it 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.160
 commutative commutative law 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 multiplications 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 Well, let's try to figure out what it is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.079
 Equally remind that this is just one 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 of the methods of computing actually them 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 lots of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.899
 then we'll talk about why this 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.600
 the method works so we start here with 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 this bottom three we need to multiply it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.960
 for each value in bits 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 first multiply 3 by 2 3 multiply by 2 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.240
 remember multiplication table is 6 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 then 3 times 2 is 6 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.640
 we write down in the discharge of units now to us 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.460
 you need to calculate what is 3 times multiplied by 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.610
 3 again from the multiplication table we 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.680
 we know that 3 multiplied by 3 is 9 and so 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.439
 as we multiply 3 by the value in the discharge 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 a dozen of that and the result we write in 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.150
 dozen discharges 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.549
 thats all we did on assignment 32 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 multiply by 3 is 96 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.899
 why is it like this 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.619
 I think I will tell you 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.310
 3 times 32 is the same as 3 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.310
 multiply by 30 plus 3 multiply by 2 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 look carefully at this expression 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 isn't that the same thing we did right here 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.509
 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 30 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 up to 90 we add 6 90 and in total we get 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.960
 96 that's all I think here everything is clear yes 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960
 see you soon
