until I got here in Los Angeles really I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.260 
until I got here in Los Angeles really I
had<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> stage<00:03:12.160> background<00:03:12.730> which<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.120> also

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
think helps though with this because

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.470 
think helps though with this because
this<00:03:14.800> is<00:03:14.950> almost<00:03:15.130> feels<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.790> forming<00:03:16.300> on<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
stage yes so here we are this is

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690
