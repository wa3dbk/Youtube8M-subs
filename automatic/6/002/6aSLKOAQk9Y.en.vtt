00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.350
 manufacturer are out of the ordinary again 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.490
 tablet and smartphone market and in particular 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.750
 the ai would talk 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.180
 and there they have a new headset 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.140
 introduced is called the amp period such as 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.120
 I say it right 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.710
 this new it it costs 300 euros that is 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 quite hefty and he calls himself one 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.560
 bit of a cup 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.910
 style but m the expiration time 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 tested what are we more about that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.700
 to tell 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.410
 after this his home to period such as 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.750
 made so to speak the designed for 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.460
 iOS devices especially the iPhone and iPad 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.469
 and then you actually push ipod touch 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 and what especially stands out is this one 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.339
 his house costs 300 euros and that is best 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.109
 quite hefty if you watch the people 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.789
 build that you look like grail in construction 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.199
 could say it is just fda and 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.239
 run it looks a bit like one 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.440
 cheap and put you he knows a few 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.789
 nice experiments 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.739
 so we can for example if they him 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.629
 you must really like it 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.460
 but nevertheless yes it is just normal 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.019
 headset it fits nicely around the ears 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.519
 You can easily joining 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.109
 set that is well done 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.579
 he will have a wired so he is not 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.780
 wireless 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.760
 but in the sense that you actually 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.069
 simply via 10 half mm on each device 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.439
 actually set it there and after them 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.850
 is never okay is no cancellation of 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.369
 are also none 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 Battery on or blood in that we are just sorry 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.119
 we also have a last page i 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.280
 reviewed it all has one on 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.079
 only 50 euros more than that would be 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.109
 might be a better option but so 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.159
 discretion I bare it as 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.810
 I say it safely with retie 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.770
 functionality but with very good 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.420
 sound 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.640
 are he himself against death that that 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.740
 you're inspired for the ones by DJs and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.689
 Made for the street to come 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 s eyes are rustic but the sound is real 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.780
 very good for if you like the bass and so on 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.700
 are really very good heart sharp 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.259
 actually, and autumn doesn't start either 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.570
 The vibration also take no deformation 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.920
 where and in the high and low tones that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.869
 are just very good at this, we again 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.579
 headset and put his house there of course 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.799
 unknown to us 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.600
 well like being right with that sick of press 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.710
 what we read about then it has 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.079
 really much better audio 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.850
 so for 550 euros less you just have 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.829
 better audio than the predator what us 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.929
 and the functionality census one 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.490
 bit less you have no wireless 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.780
 bluetooth connection was in itself 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.909
 too bad for if you want on the street 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
 and if you really want to expire you 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.549
 must always have such a l guess you one 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.020
 little there bubbling 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.330
 use 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.470
 what in itself will ever take us to town 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.879
 is the build quality 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650
 evening just a bit like a family 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.120
 cheapa not very much 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.200
 yes high and fraud means mechanic 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.140
 just really a lot of money for one 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.069
 headset and you just notice about this 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.980
 that your threads 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.390
 doing flowers and things and yes that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 actually could have been better off 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.060
 U.S 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.500
 so if you are really an audiophile then 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.390
 this house is just a really great place 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.489
 choice but it is not that much 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.980
 functionality and in itself a bit 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.330
 weird that made for ios devices want 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.890
 you can use it with a three and a half mm 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.720
 actually connect any device 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.700
 Also if you have an android phone then 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.280
 You will be the one with this senize there for a period 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.630
 no he do a bad buy but it is 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.340
 a bit of a shame that you have so little 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.940
 in functionality for that price so 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.780
 a bit of a weird one 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.780
 value for money
