00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.100
 when bands like they are here in mx 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.619
 reporting and gentlemen today 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.320
 I bring the second part of the super achievement 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.349
 Easy for extension mode 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.170
 ecological if you did not see the first part 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.640
 are three achievements so easy factual milestones 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.999
 is the previous video then why 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.949
 check it out and good is the second part 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.250
 are three other achievements are also very 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.380
 easy and good of what it is about what 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.750
 this video is about that 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.280
 we finished the extension module the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.800
 first time I finish it by the way 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.290
 good as I feel after having it 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.480
 finished I do not know I feel weird because in 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.240
 reality it was very easy to extinction mod 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.870
 it is easy to finish it in fact, because that is 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.870
 the end is that he fled and good the pd 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 at the beginning it is a bit difficult 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.270
 because inevitably we have to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.510
 raise the level 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 bullets especially and weapons and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 gusts that no advantages in calling you that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.940
 delivered to us at the beginning is also 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 shit the truth is that it exists in my 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.259
 career but then already rising in level 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.020
 Well, your money is improving 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.659
 that you are winning or accumulating when you kill 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.729
 aliens because it invests better in better 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.520
 the best streaks are the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.340
 turrets the bulge I do not know different things 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.720
 that help you a lot to pass this 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.539
 game mode and that is not done so 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 difficult in fact it gets faster and 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.910
 because obviously if you have a team with a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.440
 good acceptable equipment that are not even 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.210
 even all team members 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.880
 they have to be high level there 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.830
 can cover each other there are many 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.380
 combinations that can be of a level 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.330
 high with a low level and that can be 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.850
 help each other and later on 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.909
 upload a more detailed video and already 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.310
 with all the steps to survive the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.380
 extinction in call of duty thing but 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.360
 good gentlemen this would be a video more 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.620
 forward now let's see the three 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.660
 achievements 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.200
 that you get practically are see no 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.180
 deteriorations I got from a milestone and from 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.070
 preference get the ones of a milestone 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.320
 so they do not have to go through the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.080
 extension mode because the truth is that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.820
 They are easy and worth make them 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.320
 only once and good then it 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'm going to tell them and I'm going to 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.730
 explain since as all the achievements of 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.830
 Extinction 'do not come out in the game are 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.330
 are marked as secret achievements that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.640
 I do not know why but good gentlemen the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.640
 first it's called I came out alive and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.740
 obviously I know how the name 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 he says he is to come out alive and escape 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.760
 for the first time in the extinguishing mode 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.210
 easy is to simply complete the game 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.000
 the second one is called nobody nobody stays 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.610
 back or something like that and good is that with 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.890
 four players all escape this 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.450
 Well, as I told you, it's the most 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.370
 advisable to always play four 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.710
 players because it makes it easier to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.720
 game can be covered between 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.180
 we can cover ourselves and obviously 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.510
 Well, it's also more fun than 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.049
 laughter and good signs 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 and the third that was the third 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.849
 and that's how the runner is called the other one 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.610
 another achievement and well I will explain it 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.110
 gentlemen when we activate the neck right now 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.420
 as you just saw in the gameplay 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.430
 we have to escape they are going to give us four 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.190
 minutes to return to the helicopter 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.840
 from the beginning where they left us and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.890
 good in what we have to do is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.100
 come back before the clock 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.130
 marquez or they are more than minute and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.110
 medium and good only tell them that of 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.790
 done this is always recommended 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.830
 whatever the circumstances because 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.959
 The more late in returning more 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.850
 difficult is going to put obviously is not 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.620
 so easy is not just running and 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.380
 back there you will put this to 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.410
 this is like cheating I tell you that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.900
 you have giants but good you're going to 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.190
 be there as another I walk and they will 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.780
 be a little bit of emotion and they're going to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.790
 be working but nothing of the other 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.270
 world what I what what I give them 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.520
 I recommend is to remove the light machine 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.680
 or the guns the rifles they have and 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.090
 run with the pistolitas since this 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.340
 obviously it's going to make you move 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 faster and when the mother gets it 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.000
 I do not let you get stuck 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.550
 obviously they will also go out there 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.620
 many years then there yes put all 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.049
 the turrets and all their arsenal so that 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.940
 be as fast as possible that you do not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.190
 they are going to kill that no one is going to stay 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.650
 back and another very important thing is not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.110
 get hooked with the kingdoms 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.660
 the devil or these big mothers who 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.970
 they go to you because those of a 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.160
 attack they kill you and they go in to take what 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.250
 what will your team think and maybe 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.050
 troll and is that you make them kill all your 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 team what to do then it is 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.270
 they are just shooting them but from 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.610
 preference if you can run runs not you 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.380
 they will reach it is very difficult either 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 they do not surround you and you get ahead 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.580
 aliens will leave you only for 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.430
 back and good guys this has been all 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.190
 The truth is that when you get level 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.570
 This extinction mode is very easy 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.639
 we just have to wait for 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.150
 other comrades arrive and that's it 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.030
 three achievements so leave it for all very 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.340
 easy 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.140
 has this extension mode future without 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.900
 But well, I hope the lcd ones 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.720
 are included in more parts something history 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.380
 it would not look bad and good guys this has 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.240
 been everything are the two points of I do not know 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.570
 how much are the playstation trophies 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.650
 but good gentlemen this has been all 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.220
 any comment any doubt 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.160
