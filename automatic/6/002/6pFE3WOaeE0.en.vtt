00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.689
 in the militia therefore this one is enough 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.339
 painful question it is very relevant 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.020
 so thank you for it 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.030
 not part of the threat that they have not yet been reported 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.209
 the only thing that was answered 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.089
 but there was no trust 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.969
 confidential conversation percent total 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.579
 familiar 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.159
 on the subject of what is not possible for us 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.369
 need a different way 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 we do not consider this as a threat to read 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.919
 what is it 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.189
 desire is an opinion and not of anyone in common 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.969
 mediate little in 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.019
 some conciliatory 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.280
 procedures but 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.390
 it concerned mainly 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 on that song 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540
 and which appeared on the Internet 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.460
 but simply nowhere 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.840
 hand the result of this song had 80 map followed 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.590
 relationship that is, they did not write it did not sing 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.749
 so that 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.010
 that's the only thing 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.710
 percentage factor that took place 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 be 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.590
 still would 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.620
 pick up 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.700
 book percentage of women area 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.970
 outside explain all the same that this is the third 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.400
 experimental as you said recording 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 the terrorist 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.840
 employees who may be 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.180
 serves there 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.540
 We offer luck this is the first I will inform you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.980
 Honor enrolled in Kiev graduate 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.440
 Migimo public foundation is kind of back and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.870
 During this time of change, there will be some other kind 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.890
 a form of amnesia observation case work 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.590
 so now it's about experimental 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 work and here we are there are three recording forms 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.330
 conducted simultaneously this will allow both traffic police and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 this here is another form set there 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
 still actively shipments we will clarify the days 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.910
 general line of our students 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.780
 look gave if you are who was driving 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.370
 Mercedes cars 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.500
 thanks hall this question I beg you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.369
 there is a procedural status 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.420
 here then maybe adventure 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.810
 can you explain why all the same 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.719
 drivers 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.720
 feel fine and cases 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.090
 the fact that the rear seat passengers got 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 to the hospital right here with us 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.790
 the question is 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.130
 the project was already driving the concept because 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.990
 that the rear seats are not at all 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.899
 suffered front 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.109
 driver's course very much 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.919
 deformed therefore probability 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.790
 the fact that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.740
 the driver got to the hospital she of course 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.810
 very high so elementary logic 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.040
 just tips and we have this huge 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.099
 sorry 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.530
 changing, I don’t know 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.060
 no witnesses 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.069
 who was driving because now 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.319
 I have such a good situation 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.329
 In the first place, a little time passed. 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.620
 second yes 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.989
 photos of one of the pits are on the Internet 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.100
 so of course if someone would help us 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.060
 it would be great to define youtube all 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.379
 such of those passing by a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.149
 who was driving 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.409
 interest rank with scientific proper 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.489
 saying we have witnesses who like 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.640
 would have seen 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.240
 they will remain at the scene and 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.990
 they are ready to testify about who 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.800
 was difficult what you don't have 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.230
 preliminary information all the same 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.260
 it was who was driving but here we are from there 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.749
 true 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:13.800
 I know 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.299
 soulful 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.229
 in the national championship 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.229
 hockey these factors 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.059
 yes show 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.649
 question about two people who but 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.049
 most large telescope 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.619
 would like to tell this 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.059
 the news was told in principle by the lawyer 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:32.069
 under criminal law 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.139
 procedural code 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.099
 we have the right to collect 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.309
 evidence from so far so far 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:37.090
 is open 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.069
 but how can a lawyer make up 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.890
 official documents create 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.780
 Mot methodology per year when the form 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.799
 bottle interrogation protocol 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.680
 This, too, may be in sn. 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.649
 which will allow angle 40 lawmaking 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.879
 of us will not limit the possibility of release 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.519
 transmission of that pharmaceutical 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.019
 This format day Cyril dollars just 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.219
 so what can you say about that year 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.369
 people whose new tests differ from 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.369
 official eu 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.019
 Well, I understand that as well as told 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.589
 something that ever showed that 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.589
 all right leave tut speaker 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.150
 at today's meeting side 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.359
 will try to extend this afford 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.029
 ask yourself questions like this 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.399
 now this question is so clock frequency 

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:27.219
 visit shame 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.639
 we work intensively 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.639
 missing Stanley 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.020
 visiting a completed level 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.710
 question Cherkasen husband here because 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.900
 cleaning is not clear who is to blame 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.189
 marinated relatives 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.309
 dead the company Lukoil on what 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.689
 diseases rose and offered as 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.150
 to compensate 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.580
 buy this 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.550
 to fight 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.659
 general opinion first by law ha 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.300
 if my question is, will Alexander 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.240
 another real he is such a step kay 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.990
 Too question its sidelnikova she 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.810
 generally unequivocal understand that is 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.569
 all sorts ap company lukoil it was 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.789
 passengers understand 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.849
 And the company Lukoil of course should 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.270
 compensate for the damage as I think so the percentage 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.499
 this question to me n unequivocal which 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.830
 says in the law that the owner 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.849
 means of increased danger carries 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.599
 eib responsibility 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.110
 not in this situation of course the question is about 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.459
 liability this 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:37.950
 of course the second series 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.950
 and after the criminal investigation 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.430

 I will give an example 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:54.990
 pensions 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.789
 concerns the definition of human currency two 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:05:59.800
 human 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.270
 go faced strongly stepped on 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.509
 leg if man turns to say

 word sorry 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.400
 I'm not talking about other matters 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.830
 did not sound 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.029
 well 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.559
 when we all summarize our 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:21.849
 press conferences 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.110
 I want to catch glory check and check 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.259
 other experts about the same 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.270
 same day to 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.650
 not so easy 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.479
 ak society has already passed its verdict 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.119

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.219
 Well, and expressed and will be in the works 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.269
 can be different to this but 

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:41.459
 the main thing that the company woke up and said 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.419
 about what but wants 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.220
 let it be in this form 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.150
 but she wants honesty 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.560
 objectivity and equality to 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.040
 The law of Baku is the same for all. We hope that 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.979
 our meeting today is just ambassador 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.710

 there is no what anymore 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.430
 these equity measures a 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.870
 really objective 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.740

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.819
 we understood how we respond to 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:14.689
 similar
