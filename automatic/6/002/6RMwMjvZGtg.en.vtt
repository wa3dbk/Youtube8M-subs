without<00:01:42.940> moving<00:01:43.300> my<00:01:44.640> base<00:01:45.640> at<00:01:45.910> all<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.290> then

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
without moving my base at all and then

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.690 
without moving my base at all and then
rubbing<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.740> as<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:47.950> get<00:01:48.100> further<00:01:48.280> up<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.580> want

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
rubbing it as I get further up you want

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.160 
rubbing it as I get further up you want
to<00:01:48.790> make<00:01:48.880> sure<00:01:48.910> it<00:01:49.180> stays<00:01:49.480> on<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.750> cheekbone

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
to make sure it stays on the cheekbone

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.270 
to make sure it stays on the cheekbone
so<00:01:50.410> you<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:50.650> end<00:01:50.740> up<00:01:50.830> with<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:51.100> like<00:01:51.190> a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
so you don't end up with just like a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.110

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
today but also you can do you know the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.870 
today but also you can do you know the
temples<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.860> top<00:02:50.130> part<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.489> forehead

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880

and wherever the Sun naturally hits I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.490 
and wherever the Sun naturally hits I
suppose<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.390> best<00:02:57.720> place<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:57.989> illuminate

suppose is the best place for illuminate

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.350 
suppose is the best place for illuminate
that's<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:58.830> about<00:02:58.980> lighting<00:02:59.910> up<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.030> face

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
that's all about lighting up that face

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.590 
that's all about lighting up that face
and<00:03:00.510> make<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.660> look<00:03:00.900> luminous<00:03:01.230> um<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.730> with

that being said the only don't do they

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.259 
that being said the only don't do they
can<00:03:05.790> think<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.150> um<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:08.550> applying<00:03:09.090> this

layer of powder on if you are a heavy
heavy<00:03:13.019> powder<00:03:13.320> wearer<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:14.430> best<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.760> sort<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
heavy powder wearer it's best to sort of

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.210 
heavy powder wearer it's best to sort of
leave<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:16.080> liquid<00:03:16.230> illuminator<00:03:16.739> for<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
leave the liquid illuminator for a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.509 
leave the liquid illuminator for a
little<00:03:17.430> bit<00:03:17.519> altogether<00:03:18.300> maybe<00:03:19.070> but<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.430> know

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
little bit altogether maybe but you know

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.650 
little bit altogether maybe but you know
leaving<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.239> bit<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
leaving it for a little bit is a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.449 
leaving it for a little bit is a
probably<00:03:22.470> good<00:03:22.680> idea<00:03:22.920> too<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.370> not

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
probably good idea too so it's not

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.009 
probably good idea too so it's not
freshest<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.000> your<00:03:24.120> powder<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.750> had<00:03:24.870> time

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
freshest so your powder is just had time

to relax and kind of sink in and then

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.300 
to relax and kind of sink in and then
you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:28.019> take<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.769> being<00:03:28.980> light<00:03:29.160> with

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
you can take this just being light with

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.180 
you can take this just being light with
your<00:03:29.400> fingers<00:03:30.799> otherwise<00:03:31.799> you'll<00:03:31.980> end<00:03:32.040> up

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
your fingers otherwise you'll end up

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.340 
your fingers otherwise you'll end up
kind<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.489> with<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.640> bit<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.880> paste<00:03:33.350> which

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
kind of with a bit of a paste which

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.960 
kind of with a bit of a paste which
isn't<00:03:34.530> ideal<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.549> all<00:03:35.640> about<00:03:35.790> being

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
isn't ideal but it's all about being

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.449 
isn't ideal but it's all about being
light<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.239> your<00:03:36.360> hands<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.720> you'll<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.930> fine

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
light with your hands and you'll be fine

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.440 
light with your hands and you'll be fine
other<00:03:38.459> than<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.970> think<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.239> should<00:03:39.269> be

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
other than that I think you should be

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.569 
other than that I think you should be
fine<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:40.140> all<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.590> know<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:41.100> may<00:03:41.340> seem

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
fine it's all just you know it may seem

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.949 
fine it's all just you know it may seem
easy<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.850> try<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.480> see<00:03:42.660> how<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.930> goes

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
easy to try it and see how it goes

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.199 
easy to try it and see how it goes
obviously<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.549> probably<00:03:44.820> better<00:03:44.970> on<00:03:45.030> top

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
obviously this is probably better on top

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.729 
obviously this is probably better on top
of<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.420> liquid<00:03:45.570> foundation<00:03:45.870> without<00:03:46.260> powder

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
of the liquid foundation without powder

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.470 
of the liquid foundation without powder
