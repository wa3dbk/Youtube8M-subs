00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that is cloud everything pretty much the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.100 
that is cloud everything pretty much the
main<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:34.170> obviously<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.920> play<00:00:35.070> games<00:00:36.110> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
main thing obviously is to play games on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
main thing obviously is to play games on
the<00:00:37.260> GAR<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.640> access<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> future

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
games and things like that so I will

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549 
games and things like that so I will
just<00:00:42.030> boot<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> game<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.140> robots

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
just boot up a game that's going robots

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.850 
just boot up a game that's going robots
paddle<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.870> find<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> does<00:00:46.530> work

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
paddle and I find that it does work

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.020 
paddle and I find that it does work
pretty<00:00:47.160> well<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.430> mean<00:00:47.789> especially

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pretty well I mean especially

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
pretty well I mean especially
considering<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> game<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> robot

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
considering the kind of game that robot

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
considering the kind of game that robot
says<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.550> works<00:00:50.640> fairly<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.629> mobile

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
says it works fairly well as a mobile

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
says it works fairly well as a mobile
app<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> I'll<00:00:54.059> probably<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.449> skip<00:00:54.719> ahead

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
app so I'll probably just skip ahead

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.130 
app so I'll probably just skip ahead
here<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.399> okay<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.539> see<00:00:57.750> we

actually<00:04:35.729> pretty<00:04:36.720> pretty<00:04:37.260> quick<00:04:37.560> and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
actually pretty pretty quick and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.460 
actually pretty pretty quick and
responsive<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.400> found<00:04:38.780> logged<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.050> about<00:04:40.289> a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
responsive I found logged in in about a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.680 
responsive I found logged in in about a
second<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.160> me

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
second of me

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.360 
second of me
which<00:04:43.200> is<00:04:43.320> quite<00:04:43.440> surprising<00:04:43.620> too<00:04:43.979> since<00:04:44.220> my

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
which is quite surprising too since my

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.029 
which is quite surprising too since my
internet<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.789> very<00:04:44.820> horrible<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.740> we'll<00:04:46.919> just

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
internet is very horrible so we'll just

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.879 
internet is very horrible so we'll just
go<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.310> game<00:04:47.490> section<00:04:48.380> most<00:04:49.380> games<00:04:49.650> do<00:04:49.860> not

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
go to the game section most games do not

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.250 
go to the game section most games do not
run<00:04:50.610> very<00:04:50.639> well<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.750> yet

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
run very well just yet

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.779 
run very well just yet
much<00:04:53.130> like<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.580> iOS<00:04:53.700> version<00:04:54.889> so<00:04:55.889> it's<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.460> very

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
much like the iOS version so it's a very

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.969 
much like the iOS version so it's a very
bad<00:04:56.940> idea<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.389> go<00:04:57.510> into<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> very<00:04:58.050> intensive

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
bad idea to go into a very intensive

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.950 
bad idea to go into a very intensive
game<00:04:59.160> like<00:04:59.370> faced<00:04:59.610> Wars<00:04:59.940> which<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.450> near

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
game like faced Wars which is near

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.500 
game like faced Wars which is near
impossible<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.500> play<00:05:01.700> because<00:05:02.700> most<00:05:03.090> devices

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
impossible to play because most devices

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.270 
impossible to play because most devices
don't<00:05:03.690> have<00:05:03.810> enough<00:05:04.020> RAM<00:05:04.500> or<00:05:04.740> graphic

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
don't have enough RAM or graphic

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.080 
don't have enough RAM or graphic
graphical<00:05:06.060> capabilities<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.800> we'll<00:05:08.669> try<00:05:08.910> and

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
graphical capabilities so we'll try and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.640 
graphical capabilities so we'll try and
work<00:05:09.270> at<00:05:09.389> a<00:05:09.450> pizza<00:05:09.780> place<00:05:09.900> although<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.320> can't

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
work at a pizza place although I can't

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.159 
work at a pizza place although I can't
guarantee<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.220> work<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:12.479> it's<00:05:12.870> just<00:05:12.990> like

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
guarantee this to work so it's just like

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.920 
guarantee this to work so it's just like
a<00:05:13.200> regular<00:05:13.440> like<00:05:13.860> play<00:05:14.220> page<00:05:14.520> we'll<00:05:15.419> just<00:05:15.630> hit

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
a regular like play page we'll just hit

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.029 
a regular like play page we'll just hit
play<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:17.000> we<00:05:18.000> will<00:05:18.120> wait<00:05:18.300> for<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.750> load

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
play and we will wait for this to load

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.320 
play and we will wait for this to load
alright<00:05:20.039> it's<00:05:20.250> been<00:05:20.400> about<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.639> minute<00:05:20.940> or<00:05:21.150> two

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
alright it's been about a minute or two

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.930 
alright it's been about a minute or two
now<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.110> game<00:05:22.380> has<00:05:22.710> failed<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.490> load<00:05:23.729> as

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
now and the game has failed to load as

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.240 
now and the game has failed to load as
you'll<00:05:24.120> see<00:05:24.360> well<00:05:24.780> it's<00:05:25.110> it's<00:05:25.590> loading<00:05:25.979> but

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
you'll see well it's it's loading but

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.589 
you'll see well it's it's loading but
it's<00:05:26.400> very<00:05:26.729> slow<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:29.190> can<00:05:29.280> see

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
it's very slow so as you can see

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.210 
it's very slow so as you can see
intensive<00:05:30.599> games<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.110> lots<00:05:31.289> of<00:05:31.410> parts<00:05:31.830> do

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
intensive games with lots of parts do

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.700 
intensive games with lots of parts do
not<00:05:32.250> typically<00:05:33.030> work<00:05:33.330> although<00:05:34.110> he<00:05:34.410> is<00:05:34.530> saying

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
not typically work although he is saying

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.330 
not typically work although he is saying
waiting<00:05:35.039> for<00:05:35.190> character<00:05:35.550> now<00:05:35.729> so<00:05:36.090> there<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.810> a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
waiting for character now so there is a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.150 
waiting for character now so there is a
possibility<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.370> this

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
possibility that this

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.210 
possibility that this
we'll<00:05:39.400> run<00:05:39.910> howbeit<00:05:40.540> I<00:05:40.930> doubt<00:05:41.440> he<00:05:41.590> will<00:05:41.740> run<00:05:41.980> it

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
we'll run howbeit I doubt he will run it

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.960 
we'll run howbeit I doubt he will run it
very<00:05:42.250> well

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
very well

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.300 
very well
okay<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:44.050> game<00:05:44.230> has<00:05:44.260> just<00:05:44.770> about<00:05:44.950> loaded

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
okay so the game has just about loaded

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.510 
okay so the game has just about loaded
so<00:05:45.610> we've<00:05:45.880> got<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.120> GUI<00:05:46.600> or<00:05:46.870> GUI<00:05:47.140> here<00:05:47.520> what's

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
so we've got a GUI or GUI here what's

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.300 
so we've got a GUI or GUI here what's
new<00:05:48.790> we'll<00:05:49.390> just<00:05:49.570> close<00:05:49.750> that<00:05:49.950> so<00:05:50.950> as<00:05:51.100> you<00:05:51.220> can

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
new we'll just close that so as you can

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.330 
new we'll just close that so as you can
see<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:51.730> does<00:05:52.150> run<00:05:52.480> and<00:05:52.990> fairly<00:05:53.830> smoothly<00:05:54.130> as

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
see it does run and fairly smoothly as

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.070 
see it does run and fairly smoothly as
well<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.760> few<00:05:55.300> people<00:05:55.510> were<00:05:55.630> talking<00:05:55.900> about

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
well a few people were talking about

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.730 
well a few people were talking about
this<00:05:56.410> in<00:05:56.920> a<00:05:57.190> group<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.760> am<00:05:57.910> in<00:05:58.090> about<00:05:59.050> how<00:05:59.350> it's

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
this in a group I am in about how it's

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.360 
this in a group I am in about how it's
slightly<00:06:01.110> laggy<00:06:02.110> and<00:06:02.500> framerate<00:06:02.890> isn't<00:06:03.220> very

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
slightly laggy and framerate isn't very

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.160 
slightly laggy and framerate isn't very
good<00:06:03.550> but<00:06:03.790> what<00:06:04.300> I've<00:06:04.480> found<00:06:04.750> even<00:06:04.960> on

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
good but what I've found even on

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.080 
good but what I've found even on
intensive<00:06:05.650> games<00:06:05.890> it<00:06:06.340> does<00:06:06.640> seem<00:06:06.850> to<00:06:06.970> run

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
intensive games it does seem to run

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.110 
intensive games it does seem to run
quite<00:06:07.390> well<00:06:07.600> especially<00:06:07.930> for<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.410> beta<00:06:08.590> app<00:06:09.120> but

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
quite well especially for a beta app but

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.660 
quite well especially for a beta app but
that<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.630> possibly<00:06:11.380> because<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:12.040> my<00:06:12.250> firing<00:06:12.520> it

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
that is possibly because of my firing it

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.660 
that is possibly because of my firing it
being<00:06:12.910> quite<00:06:13.330> high-end<00:06:14.040> it<00:06:15.040> may<00:06:15.250> because<00:06:15.550> it

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
being quite high-end it may because it

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.640 
being quite high-end it may because it
be<00:06:15.880> because<00:06:16.030> of<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.690> because<00:06:17.440> not

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
be because of that and because not

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.050 
be because of that and because not
everyone<00:06:17.920> has<00:06:18.070> you<00:06:18.340> know<00:06:18.460> a<00:06:18.490> powerful<00:06:18.880> fire

everyone has you know a powerful fire

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.350 
everyone has you know a powerful fire
obviously<00:06:19.510> but<00:06:20.440> apart<00:06:21.370> from<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:21.580> it's<00:06:21.940> much

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
