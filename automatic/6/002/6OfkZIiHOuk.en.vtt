00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.880 

just<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.560> make<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:02.070> very<00:00:02.340> clear<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.440> this<00:00:04.440> part

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
just to make is very clear in this part

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.880 
just to make is very clear in this part
we<00:00:05.220> are<00:00:05.460> actually<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.750> make<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
we are actually going to make the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.830 
we are actually going to make the
category<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.820> PHP<00:00:09.450> file<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.639> delete<00:00:11.639> post<00:00:12.300> dot

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
category of PHP file and delete post dot

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.420 
category of PHP file and delete post dot
PHP<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.340> category<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> PHP<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:16.340> we<00:00:17.990> want<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
PHP so category to PHP first we want to

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
PHP so category to PHP first we want to
display<00:00:20.430> data<00:00:21.020> based<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.460> category<00:00:26.930> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
display data based on the category so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.889 
display data based on the category so
we're<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:29.220> posts<00:00:32.090> no<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> not

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
we're going to get posts no we do not

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.729 
we're going to get posts no we do not
need<00:00:34.140> posts<00:00:34.620> ID<00:00:34.880> what<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.469> instead<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
need posts ID what we need instead is a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.369 
need posts ID what we need instead is a
category<00:00:38.520> ID<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> specified<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:41.270> the

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
category ID which is specified in the

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:50.020 
category ID which is specified in the
URL<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> edit<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:47.700> posts<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.980> we

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
URL so we need to edit get posts and we

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.790 
URL so we need to edit get posts and we
essentially<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> same<00:00:51.899> thing<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.469> with

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
essentially do the same thing as with

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.060 
essentially do the same thing as with
the<00:00:52.829> post<00:00:53.430> ID<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.739> s<00:00:55.980> set<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.579> ID<00:00:57.739> gasps<00:00:58.739> ID

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the post ID so if s set get ID gasps ID

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
the post ID so if s set get ID gasps ID
equals<00:00:59.730> int<00:01:00.649> gasps<00:01:01.649> ID<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:03.049> query<00:01:04.049> does

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
equals int gasps ID and query does

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:22.210 
equals int gasps ID and query does
equals<00:01:05.489> where<00:01:08.750> cats<00:01:09.750> ID<00:01:12.920> equals<00:01:19.549> get<00:01:20.549> ID<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
equals where cats ID equals get ID it

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.109 
equals where cats ID equals get ID it
may<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.280> slightly<00:01:24.060> better<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.049> categories

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
may be slightly better to use categories

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.240 
may be slightly better to use categories
those<00:01:27.119> ID<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> guess<00:01:29.850> ID<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.630> fine

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
those ID here but guess ID is just fine

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
those ID here but guess ID is just fine
and<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.259> need<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> oops<00:01:36.079> display<00:01:37.079> all

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and now we need to oops display all

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.760 
and now we need to oops display all
those<00:01:37.680> posts<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.180> exactly<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.439> same

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
those posts and that's exactly the same

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.870 
those posts and that's exactly the same
as<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.880> index<00:01:42.570> dot<00:01:42.810> PHP<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
as in index dot PHP so I'm going to be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.350 
as in index dot PHP so I'm going to be
lazier<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:47.780> i'm<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.130> copy<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> entire

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
lazier and i'm going to copy this entire

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.139 
lazier and i'm going to copy this entire
thing<00:01:52.790> paste<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:56.040> be

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
thing paste it in here now it would be

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.780 
thing paste it in here now it would be
probably<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.659> even<00:01:57.869> better<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.649> create<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
probably be even better to create a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.840 
probably be even better to create a
function<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.680> us<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:02.520> we

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
function to do this for us because we

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.029 
function to do this for us because we
are<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.180> doing<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> exact<00:02:04.380> same<00:02:04.469> thing<00:02:05.630> twice

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
are now doing the exact same thing twice

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.180 
are now doing the exact same thing twice
which<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.879> bad<00:02:09.090> programming<00:02:09.629> practice<00:02:10.190> but

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
which is a bad programming practice but

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.309 
which is a bad programming practice but
for<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> sake<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.270> tutorial<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:13.050> just

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
for the sake of this tutorial I'm just

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.820 
for the sake of this tutorial I'm just
going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> do

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to do

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.240 
going to do
like<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:19.170> keep<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> focus<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:20.010> my

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
like this to to keep the focus on my

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.140 
like this to to keep the focus on my
sequel<00:02:20.670> bit<00:02:22.940> when<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.410> display<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:26.150> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
sequel bit when we display this now this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.360 
sequel bit when we display this now this
is<00:02:27.450> something<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:29.280> do<00:02:29.520> not<00:02:29.550> need<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.240> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
is something you do not need to see that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.990 
is something you do not need to see that
was<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:33.110> topic<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.470> which<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.160> discussed<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
was a topic in which we discussed the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.840 
was a topic in which we discussed the
code<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.990> wrote<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.040> blog<00:02:38.340> thing

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
code that I wrote for the blog thing

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.940 
code that I wrote for the blog thing
here<00:02:40.760> pretty<00:02:41.760> useful<00:02:42.030> then<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.380> topic<00:02:43.800> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
here pretty useful then that topic is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.699 
here pretty useful then that topic is
actually<00:02:45.950> where<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.490> pointed<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:51.709> this

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
actually where I got pointed out to this

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.490 
actually where I got pointed out to this
little<00:02:53.010> technique<00:02:55.490> anyway<00:02:56.990> let's<00:02:57.990> try<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
little technique anyway let's try to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.530 
little technique anyway let's try to
stay<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.100> topic<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.640> bit<00:03:01.070> when<00:03:02.070> we<00:03:02.310> go<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.640> say

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
stay on topic a bit when we go to say

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.490 
stay on topic a bit when we go to say
the<00:03:03.780> uncategorized<00:03:04.560> category<00:03:06.200> which<00:03:07.200> has<00:03:07.380> an

the uncategorized category which has an

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
ID of 10 category oh that's coma bhp

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.229 
ID of 10 category oh that's coma bhp
obviously<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.709> want<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.400> let's<00:03:17.850> get

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
obviously not what we want so let's get

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.759 
obviously not what we want so let's get
into<00:03:18.500> index<00:03:19.500> 2.php<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:23.060> there's<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.420> culprit

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
into index 2.php and there's the culprit

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.300 
into index 2.php and there's the culprit
dots<00:03:25.769> PHP<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.870> course<00:03:28.200> we<00:03:28.440> need<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
dots PHP of course we need to do the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.640 
dots PHP of course we need to do the
same<00:03:29.640> thing<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.980> categorical<00:03:31.980> PHP<00:03:33.650> refresh

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
same thing in categorical PHP refresh

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.790 
same thing in categorical PHP refresh
this<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.360> I'll<00:03:36.360> do<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.540> again<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.080> there<00:03:37.650> we

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
this and I'll do it again and there we

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.900 
this and I'll do it again and there we
have<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.870> everything<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.560> uncategorized

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
have it everything for the uncategorized

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.110 
have it everything for the uncategorized
category<00:03:43.340> then<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.519> go<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:46.340> PHP<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.610> example

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
category then we go to PHP for example

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.080 
category then we go to PHP for example
and<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.630> only<00:03:48.840> kept<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.380> one<00:03:49.790> now<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:50.910> going

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
and we only kept this one now I'm going

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.699 
and we only kept this one now I'm going
to<00:03:51.269> add<00:03:51.510> another<00:03:51.810> category<00:03:52.400> test<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:54.709> then

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
to add another category test and then

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.880 
to add another category test and then
return<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.250> index<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.410> i'm<00:03:58.410> going<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.709> add

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
return to index and i'm going to add

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.110 
return to index and i'm going to add
opposed<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:02.100> just<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.090> post<00:04:03.690> post

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
opposed to it and it's just a post post

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.229 
opposed to it and it's just a post post
and<00:04:06.120> i'll<00:04:06.690> add<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.170> test<00:04:07.880> there<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.209> it

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
and i'll add it to test there we have it

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.620 
and i'll add it to test there we have it
and<00:04:11.420> now<00:04:12.420> i'm<00:04:12.510> going<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:13.670> delete<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:15.090> category

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
and now i'm going to delete a category

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.860 
and now i'm going to delete a category
i'm<00:04:15.900> going<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.260> delete<00:04:16.500> test<00:04:17.540> now<00:04:18.540> when<00:04:18.720> i<00:04:18.750> go

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
i'm going to delete test now when i go

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.000 
i'm going to delete test now when i go
back<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.500> index<00:04:20.630> we<00:04:21.630> see<00:04:21.930> that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
back to the index we see that

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.250 
back to the index we see that
we<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.880> not<00:04:24.060> get<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.930> test<00:04:25.440> post<00:04:25.950> at<00:04:26.840> all<00:04:27.840> even

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
we do not get the test post at all even

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.430 
we do not get the test post at all even
though<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:29.130> there<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.240> cats<00:04:30.960> ID<00:04:32.030> number<00:04:33.260> six

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:46.250 

so<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.540> we<00:04:39.540> see<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:39.870> gone<00:04:40.110> here<00:04:40.320> too<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:45.260> we

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
so and we see it's gone here too and we

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.010 
so and we see it's gone here too and we
see<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:48.330> does<00:04:49.170> not<00:04:49.650> actually<00:04:50.360> seem<00:04:51.360> to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
see that this does not actually seem to

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.450 
see that this does not actually seem to
work<00:04:54.890> now<00:04:55.890> as<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:57.000> said<00:04:57.440> this<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.500> probably<00:04:59.010> a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
work now as I said this is probably a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.070 
work now as I said this is probably a
great<00:04:59.880> challenge<00:05:00.150> for<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:02.160> do<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.810> was

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
great challenge for you to do this was

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.020 
great challenge for you to do this was
just<00:05:04.470> something<00:05:05.250> i<00:05:05.670> put<00:05:06.300> in<00:05:06.900> theory<00:05:08.030> didn't

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
just something i put in theory didn't

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.970 
just something i put in theory didn't
even<00:05:09.420> test<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.170> be<00:05:10.290> honest<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.830> i'm<00:05:10.920> just

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
even test it to be honest so i'm just

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.770 
even test it to be honest so i'm just
going<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.340> get<00:05:11.550> rid<00:05:11.760> of<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:14.300> yeah<00:05:15.300> think<00:05:15.660> of

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
going to get rid of it and yeah think of

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.850 
going to get rid of it and yeah think of
me<00:05:15.810> as<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.050> jerk<00:05:16.410> if<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.920> want<00:05:17.160> but<00:05:18.800> try<00:05:19.800> this

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
me as a jerk if you want but try this

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.570 
me as a jerk if you want but try this
yourself<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:21.080> will<00:05:22.080> be<00:05:22.290> some<00:05:23.100> good<00:05:23.310> training

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
yourself it will be some good training

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:31.760 
yourself it will be some good training
for<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:28.250> alright<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.900> we<00:05:30.900> have<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:31.260> few<00:05:31.320> more

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
for you alright so we have a few more

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.890 
for you alright so we have a few more
things<00:05:32.040> to<00:05:32.160> do<00:05:32.460> which<00:05:33.450> is<00:05:34.070> delete<00:05:35.070> post<00:05:35.430> and

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
things to do which is delete post and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.160 
things to do which is delete post and
edit<00:05:36.900> post<00:05:37.290> so<00:05:37.830> we're<00:05:37.980> almost<00:05:38.160> done<00:05:38.960> let's<00:05:39.960> go

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
edit post so we're almost done let's go

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.960 
edit post so we're almost done let's go
to<00:05:40.230> delete<00:05:40.650> post<00:05:40.980> and<00:05:42.770> this<00:05:43.770> is<00:05:44.040> essentially

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
to delete post and this is essentially

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.830 
to delete post and this is essentially
the<00:05:45.120> same<00:05:45.630> thing<00:05:45.690> as<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.380> deletes<00:05:47.340> category<00:05:47.880> so

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
the same thing as a deletes category so

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.590 
the same thing as a deletes category so
I'm<00:05:48.900> just<00:05:49.110> going<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.440> copy<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.830> code<00:05:50.280> and

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
I'm just going to copy that code and

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.410 
I'm just going to copy that code and
paste<00:05:51.600> it<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:54.830> remember<00:05:55.830> though<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.090> this<00:05:57.090> of

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
paste it in remember though that this of

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.010 
paste it in remember though that this of
course<00:05:57.750> needs<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.290> be<00:05:58.410> post<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:59.750> we<00:06:00.750> do<00:06:00.900> not

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
course needs to be post and we do not

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.330 
course needs to be post and we do not
want<00:06:01.200> to<00:06:01.410> redirect<00:06:01.800> to<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.580> category<00:06:03.420> list

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
want to redirect to the category list

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.550 
want to redirect to the category list
what<00:06:05.340> we<00:06:05.490> want<00:06:05.700> to<00:06:05.880> link<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.300> instead<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:07.080> just

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
what we want to link to instead is just

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.960 
what we want to link to instead is just
the<00:06:07.800> index<00:06:08.660> and<00:06:12.140> there's<00:06:13.140> nothing<00:06:13.560> more<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.890> it

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
the index and there's nothing more to it

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.990 
the index and there's nothing more to it
once<00:06:14.970> again<00:06:15.150> we<00:06:15.750> do<00:06:16.410> almost<00:06:16.980> the<00:06:17.250> same<00:06:17.610> thing

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
once again we do almost the same thing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.630 
once again we do almost the same thing
twice<00:06:20.210> but<00:06:21.210> again<00:06:21.630> for<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:23.340> sake<00:06:23.610> of

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
twice but again for the sake of

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.230 
twice but again for the sake of
simplicity<00:06:23.940> I'll<00:06:25.010> just<00:06:26.010> do<00:06:26.220> this<00:06:28.850> so<00:06:29.850> I'm

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
simplicity I'll just do this so I'm

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.279 
simplicity I'll just do this so I'm
going<00:06:30.480> to<00:06:30.600> add<00:06:30.810> another<00:06:31.410> test<00:06:32.250> post<00:06:32.370> test<00:06:32.820> test

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
going to add another test post test test

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.609 
going to add another test post test test
there<00:06:35.009> we<00:06:35.189> have<00:06:35.339> it<00:06:35.869> we<00:06:36.869> also<00:06:36.899> see<00:06:37.289> it's<00:06:37.409> on<00:06:37.529> the

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:37.619 
there we have it we also see it's on the

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:45.040 
there we have it we also see it's on the
index<00:06:37.949> now<00:06:38.580> I<00:06:38.610> delete<00:06:39.059> it<00:06:39.240> and<00:06:39.949> it's<00:06:40.949> gone

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.159 

let's<00:06:46.050> see<00:06:46.349> now<00:06:46.619> can<00:06:47.099> we<00:06:47.129> do<00:06:47.729> edits<00:06:48.330> both<00:06:48.809> stop

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
let's see now can we do edits both stop

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.469 
let's see now can we do edits both stop
PHP<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:51.559> suppose<00:06:52.559> we<00:06:52.770> could<00:06:53.089> what<00:06:54.089> I'm<00:06:54.240> going<00:06:54.419> to

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
PHP I suppose we could what I'm going to

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.439 
PHP I suppose we could what I'm going to
do<00:06:54.659> instead<00:06:54.809> I'm<00:06:55.349> going<00:06:55.559> to<00:06:55.680> check<00:06:55.889> if

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
do instead I'm going to check if

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.420 
do instead I'm going to check if
everything<00:06:57.449> works<00:06:58.069> the<00:06:59.069> way<00:06:59.219> it's<00:06:59.369> supposed

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
everything works the way it's supposed

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.010 
everything works the way it's supposed
to<00:06:59.879> work<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.899> think<00:07:01.349> add<00:07:01.499> category<00:07:03.020> didn't
