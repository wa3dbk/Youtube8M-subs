remember in mah room for three the game
it<00:02:20.160> would<00:02:20.550> go<00:02:20.760> sometimes<00:02:21.390> even<00:02:21.630> 11<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.050> 12

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it would go sometimes even 11 or 12

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
it would go sometimes even 11 or 12
minutes<00:02:22.590> sometimes<00:02:22.890> 13<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.580> knew<00:02:23.879> how<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
minutes sometimes 13 if you knew how to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.030 
minutes sometimes 13 if you knew how to
extend<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> game<00:02:24.780> long<00:02:24.989> enough<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.440> i<00:02:25.650> just

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
extend the game long enough and i just

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.680 
extend the game long enough and i just
don't<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.250> how<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.580> game<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.300> only<00:02:27.420> last

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
don't like how the game can only last

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.940 
don't like how the game can only last
for<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.989> 10<00:02:28.170> minutes<00:02:28.349> i'm<00:02:28.530> sure<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.860> would

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
for like 10 minutes i'm sure there would

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.309 
for like 10 minutes i'm sure there would
be<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.069> lot<00:02:29.310> more<00:02:29.340> 200-plus<00:02:29.940> go<00:02:30.209> games<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.780> it

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
be a lot more 200-plus go games if it

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.619 
be a lot more 200-plus go games if it
would<00:02:31.530> last<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.040> 11<00:02:32.550> 12<00:02:32.790> 13<00:02:32.879> minute<00:02:33.420> mark

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
would last like the 11 12 13 minute mark

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.479 
would last like the 11 12 13 minute mark
so<00:02:33.930> i<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.709> want<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.920> mention<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.310> real

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
apocalypse and this is probably the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.580 
apocalypse and this is probably the
third<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.569> fourth<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.260> I've<00:02:40.349> lived

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
drop of snow up until this point and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.410 
drop of snow up until this point and
