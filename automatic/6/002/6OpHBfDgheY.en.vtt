00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.360
 I am marco vontobel tv that is today 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.610
 our themes lg is working on his 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.200
 new top model 3gs 8 pictures 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 surfaced the colorful security gap 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 at the Samsung Galaxy line 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.900
 the new models from sony samsung htc 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 is about to start new market 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.480
 lg model g3 is currently only available 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.730
 rumors 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.559
 Now a user agent profiler became one 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.960
 so far unknown lg models with 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.449
 Drawings d 850 announced that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.280
 possibly the new lg 3 could be 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.620
 This LG smartphone has one 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.890
 high-resolution qhd display resolution 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.659
 1,440 x 2560 pixels what with the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.040
 previous known rumors about g3 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.300
 the screen does not match 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.970
 only sharper than the displays of 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.610
 samsung galaxy s 5 sony xperia z 2 and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.650
 HTC at 55 inches but with even greater 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.380
 he surpasses the size of the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.120
 screen of the current model g2 as 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 drive could be like samsung galaxy s 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.810
 15z 2 and htc 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.970
 the qualcomm quad core processor 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 snapdragon 801 are used 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.170
 maybe the new qualcomm 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.560
 super processor snapdragon 805 built-in 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.360
 his 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.890
 Currently this is quad core processor 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.299
 but not yet available 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.310
 the further technical data because 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.110
 operating system should android 454 click 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.159
 it should be a 16 megapixel 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.570
 main camera with optical 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.850
 have image stabilizer and the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 Presentation is supposedly May 2014 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.479
 or later, it's all happening here 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.310
 are not speculations 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.380
 Apple has just updated to ios 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.759
 4.1 started now are already the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.259
 first screenshots appeared on the web 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.600
 the user interface of the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.189
 successor is8 should point to the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.829
 For example, photos are the new apps 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.060
 11 book preview and textedit 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.100
 the pictures are probably from the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.020
 Chinese forum where, however, is still 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.729
 unclear if they really have the new ios 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.740
 show surface or not so missing 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.079
 for example the itunes radio app the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.060
 expected at ios 8 as a stand-alone app 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.679
 ios 8 will be the current rumor 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.450
 after a whole range of new ones 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.760
 Features for iphone ipad and ipod 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.170
 bring so for example the pdf 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.700
 preview app review and that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.050
 text processing program ends the text 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.480
 to facilitate the use of iCloud usage 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.160
 Healthcare brings a range of fitness 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 and health feature on the iphone 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.310
 ipod and co 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.720
 and also with the card service should that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.650
 to give some new services 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.330
 at work on different 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.800
 smartphones and tablet of the galaxy series 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.270
 from samsung, developers have one 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.830
 independent android system one 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.870
 so-called 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.820
 Rector discovered this allows third 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.390
 to change and read sensitive data 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.740
 to delete 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.240
 The becker should not be in the process 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.040
 actual operating system but in 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.750
 software of the processor 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.790
 According to the opinion of experts symbols 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.350
 processors are more prone to mac tors da 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.820
 you have your own operating system 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.410
 attackers are able to do so 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.220
 microphones camera and gps data 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.660
 access 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.370
 Moreover, they can also in this case 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.930
 sensitive user data access through the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.790
 constant exchange with the network of the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 mobile operator is therefore constantly 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940
 to advertise the danger victim of data theft 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.500
 from a published list 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 we learn that accordingly affected 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.810
 All devices from the galaxy series s s2 s3 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.050
 not not two nexus s and the two 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.910
 versions 2 7.0 and the 210 points money 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.840
 looks the broad should date so far 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.030
 there are none, however 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.380
 Statement by Samsung on the incident 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.030
 according to replicants could be an update 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.620
 However, remedy also be 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.330
 the mode of the affected devices better 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.130
 isolated why the hazard than 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.900
 not very high rated so light 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.240
 Trucks was the next time on Monday 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.430
 by the nose bear presents what stops 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.270
 you of the alleged lg 3 you would 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.709
 to buy that 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.140
 please write with the comments I 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.610
 look forward to your discussions and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.110
 do not forget abo so that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.070
 always be up to date from the new ones 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.450
 security gaps 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.450
 So there people until next time
