so I wish to to talk about this deck and
how<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:14.690> affected<00:01:15.690> your<00:01:16.590> work<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.430> sense

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
how it's affected your work your sense

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.410 
how it's affected your work your sense
of<00:01:19.040> moving<00:01:22.130> relationship<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.910> dancers<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
of moving relationship to the dancers to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.889 
of moving relationship to the dancers to
environment<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:30.020> even<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.229> Larry<00:01:31.710> because

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
environment to even with Larry because

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.410 
environment to even with Larry because
if<00:01:33.899> it<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.380> taking<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> 50s<00:01:35.670> mm-hmm<00:01:37.039> that's<00:01:38.420> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
if it is taking the 50s mm-hmm that's a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.490 
if it is taking the 50s mm-hmm that's a
first<00:01:39.840> step

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
first step

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
first step
yeah<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:42.619> certainly<00:01:43.619> start<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
yeah we could certainly start with the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.250 
yeah we could certainly start with the
dance<00:01:44.850> deck<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> had<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> tremendous

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
dance deck because it had a tremendous

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.789 
dance deck because it had a tremendous
impact<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.460> me<00:01:47.670> dancers<00:01:48.479> work<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.080> an<00:01:49.290> enclosed

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
impact on me dancers work in an enclosed

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.660 
impact on me dancers work in an enclosed
studio<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.680> were<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:53.100> boundaries

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
studio but here there were no boundaries

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.440 
studio but here there were no boundaries
and<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.540> every<00:01:54.869> movement<00:01:55.260> that<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> made<00:01:56.450> or

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and so every movement that you made or

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.280 
and so every movement that you made or
you<00:01:58.260> make<00:01:58.729> relates<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> space<00:02:00.600> that's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you make relates to a space that's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
you make relates to a space that's
infinite<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.760> if<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.000> lift<00:02:03.210> my<00:02:03.510> arm<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.610> studio

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
infinite so if I lift my arm in a studio

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
infinite so if I lift my arm in a studio
I<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> feeling<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I have the feeling that that there's the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.820 
I have the feeling that that there's the
ceiling<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.390> has<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> psychological

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
ceiling and that has a psychological

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.750 
ceiling and that has a psychological
effect<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.700> my<00:02:12.630> arm<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.590> whereas<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.580> I'm

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
effect of my arm going up whereas if I'm

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.350 
effect of my arm going up whereas if I'm
outside<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.750> there's<00:02:16.260> no<00:02:16.860> boundaries<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
outside and there's no boundaries the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.050 
outside and there's no boundaries the
whole<00:02:18.540> psychological<00:02:19.110> effect<00:02:19.890> shifts<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
whole psychological effect shifts so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.680 
whole psychological effect shifts so
that<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.690> sense<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.140> being<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.940> goes<00:02:23.940> through

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that the sense of being up goes through

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.240 
that the sense of being up goes through
my<00:02:24.959> body<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:26.280> into<00:02:27.000> space<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:28.440> only<00:02:28.769> affects

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
my body out into space not only affects

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.850 
my body out into space not only affects
the<00:02:29.760> movement<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:31.019> affects<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.209> sense<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.860> my

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the movement but affects the sense of my

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.000 
the movement but affects the sense of my
relationship<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.180> mice<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.989> myself<00:02:37.530> into<00:02:37.860> my

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
relationship to mice to myself into my

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.220 
relationship to mice to myself into my
body<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.850> always<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.480> relationship<00:02:40.019> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
body that it's always in relationship to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.300 
body that it's always in relationship to
a<00:02:40.470> context<00:02:41.310> beyond<00:02:41.760> myself<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.920> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
a context beyond myself and that that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.690 
a context beyond myself and that that
affects<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:45.810> only<00:02:46.019> physically<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:46.769> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
affects you not only physically but it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.640 
affects you not only physically but it
affects<00:02:48.150> me<00:02:48.510> emotionally<00:02:48.540> and

affects me emotionally and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.119 
affects me emotionally and
it<00:02:50.739> affects<00:02:51.310> me<00:02:51.489> spiritually<00:02:52.439> you<00:02:53.439> can't<00:02:53.769> you
