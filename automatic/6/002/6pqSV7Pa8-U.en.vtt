00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello, this is a new tutorial on 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.010
 cinema 4d 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.929
 and after effect in the new release you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.490
 learn how to edit intro 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 made in blue 4d 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.190
 and after effects for this we need 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 will download the intro itself 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:25.279
 after you download it open 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.279
 folder with intro and find the file format c4d 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 then maybe cinema 4d will require 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.260
 missing textures for this we need 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.260
 open the file in a format zip 4gb 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.750
 when we opened the files we need 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.020
 will change the text itself 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.460
 intro for this click on the object model- 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460
 and change the text 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.770
 after we changed the text we need 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.370
 start rendering for this open 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.930
 rendering settings 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.260
 may need to be resized 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:20.150
 this will not need this tab 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:24.070
 I specify instead of saving click 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.220
 save in a format we put Pius same 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.670
 opposite 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.420
 alpha channel put a tick on a construction site 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.410
 rendering can be closed 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.410
 click start rendering 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.290
 after rendering is over 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.730
 go to the program after effects 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.920
 after rendering is over 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.550
 can close cinema 4d 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 now downloaded folder looking for a file format 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.880
 a and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.060
 some intro uses downloaded 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:14.170
 plugins that are not in the program 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 it is desirable to download them click ok left 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 you will see the missing files on 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 missing file you need to click right 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.620
 With the button we 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.010
 after replacing the missing 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 files go to rent
