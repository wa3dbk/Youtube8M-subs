00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.600
 music that is in this video or if 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.259
 go into all the purchases that are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.290
 rebates and well I will not teach you everything 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.020
 what I bought here if I have not 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.390
 decided all the sorrows that I have 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.759
 bought some rebates prove me the for 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.529
 see how it looks, I think you can 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.589
 making them more enjoyable video can 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.890
 serve more help because you see how 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.340
 remains 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.500
 you give us a better idea than teaching it 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 here without a way 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.350
 I believe that and well I bought things 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.240
 rebates and other things that I bought were 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.940
 of season therefore they did not have 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.220
 rebate anyway with other brands 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.250
 I'm going to put down and I'm going to put the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 price why 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 for which I have taken my clothes and if 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.810
 I put in season 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.990
 the price will be quite higher 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.630
 hovering about thirty euros then it is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.400
 that there was no rebate then good of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.700
 I have decided to buy 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.350
 because I liked it and well, just me 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.990
 I'm going to focus on what I bought 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.350

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.380
 I made a fit with everything I've 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.420
