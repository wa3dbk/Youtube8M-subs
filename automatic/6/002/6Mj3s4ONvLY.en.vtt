yeah we're going to we're going to just

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.880 
yeah we're going to we're going to just
modify<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.589> it'll<00:00:50.829> turn<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.219> iTouch

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
modify it so that it'll turn the iTouch

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.750 
modify it so that it'll turn the iTouch
like<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.690> we're<00:00:55.690> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.839> do<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.050> file<00:00:56.760> some

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
like that we're going to do is file some

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.259 
like that we're going to do is file some
little<00:00:57.969> grooves<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.890> here<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:01.239> I

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
little grooves here and here so the I

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.100 
little grooves here and here so the I
touch<00:01:01.539> is<00:01:01.749> held<00:01:01.960> securely<00:01:03.839> this<00:01:04.839> can<00:01:04.989> be<00:01:05.080> a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
touch is held securely this can be a

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.740 
touch is held securely this can be a
little<00:01:05.260> bit<00:01:05.440> on<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.680> brittle<00:01:05.980> side<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.760> find

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
little bit on the brittle side so I find

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.430 
little bit on the brittle side so I find
it<00:01:07.840> easier<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.110> remove<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:09.100> section<00:01:09.370> here

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
it easier to remove this section here

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.140 
it easier to remove this section here
and<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.710> hold<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.070> flat<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.520> table<00:01:12.730> top

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
and you can hold it flat on a table top

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.180 
and you can hold it flat on a table top
which<00:01:13.810> helps<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.260> cut<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.680> evenly<00:01:15.010> on<00:01:15.100> both

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
which helps you to cut it evenly on both

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.950 
which helps you to cut it evenly on both
sides<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.540> take<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.750> metal<00:01:17.140> file<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
sides and you take a metal file and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
sides and you take a metal file and
gently<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.260> going<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.470> make<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.620> horrible

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
gently this is going to make a horrible

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.920 
gently this is going to make a horrible
noise<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.430> one<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.700> don't<00:01:22.360> need<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.600> file

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
noise and one you don't need a file

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.730 
noise and one you don't need a file
across<00:01:23.440> both<00:01:23.740> across<00:01:24.670> both<00:01:24.940> sides<00:01:25.300> here<00:01:25.740> maybe

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
across both across both sides here maybe

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:38.720 
across both across both sides here maybe
moving<00:01:27.070> your<00:01:27.460> iPod<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:27.940> safer<00:01:28.600> location

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:54.190 

it's<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.250> nice<00:01:46.399> noise<00:01:46.640> isn't<00:01:46.939> it<00:01:53.049> it's<00:01:54.049> also

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's a nice noise isn't it it's also

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.020 
it's a nice noise isn't it it's also
quite<00:01:54.530> useful<00:01:54.560> halfway<00:01:55.280> through<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.670> turn<00:01:55.880> it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
quite useful halfway through to turn it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.120 
quite useful halfway through to turn it
round<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.570> file<00:01:56.869> file<00:01:57.380> from<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.649> other<00:01:57.830> side

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
round and file file from the other side

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.880 
round and file file from the other side
because<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.060> tend<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.330> file<00:01:59.570> harbor<00:02:00.049> on<00:02:00.830> the

because you tend to file harbor on the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.190 
because you tend to file harbor on the
on<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.429> near<00:02:01.580> side<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.240> keep<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.630> even<00:02:02.750> turn<00:02:03.080> it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
on the near side to keep it even turn it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.390 
on the near side to keep it even turn it
around<00:02:03.259> every<00:02:03.590> now<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:10.900> little<00:02:11.900> bit<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.200> dust

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
around every now a little bit of dust

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.610 
around every now a little bit of dust
doesn't<00:02:13.400> take<00:02:13.670> too<00:02:13.819> long<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:15.080> like<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.500> is

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
doesn't take too long it's like this is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:26.589 
doesn't take too long it's like this is
like<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.799> two<00:02:16.010> minute<00:02:16.160> job<00:02:25.150> when<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.209> file<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
like a two minute job when you file the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.559 
like a two minute job when you file the
groove<00:02:27.430> about<00:02:28.430> four<00:02:28.819> or<00:02:28.910> five<00:02:29.060> millimeters

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
groove about four or five millimeters

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.539 
groove about four or five millimeters
down<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.950> both<00:02:31.250> sides<00:02:31.610> check<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.630> even

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
down on both sides check that it's even

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.850 
down on both sides check that it's even
then<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.640> can<00:02:34.790> get<00:02:34.880> rid<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.060> your<00:02:35.239> file<00:02:35.860> clear

like<00:02:46.609> that<00:02:47.680> now<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.890> carry<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.220> with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
like that now you can carry this with
