00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
back to apples a few problems with half

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.590 
back to apples a few problems with half
lips<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> board<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.649> only<00:01:43.829> slipping

halfway just because your front foot is
not<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:47.850> position<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.689> needs<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.229> right

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
not in my position it needs to be right

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.030 
not in my position it needs to be right
in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> middle<00:01:51.200> dead<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> middle<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in the middle dead are in the middle of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.390 
in the middle dead are in the middle of
45<00:01:53.520> degree<00:01:53.790> angle

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
45 degree angle

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.800 
45 degree angle
and<00:01:55.080> if<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.290> board's<00:01:56.500> not<00:01:56.680> spinning<00:01:57.040> up<00:01:57.190> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and if the board's not spinning up and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
and if the board's not spinning up and
just<00:01:58.810> scoop<00:01:59.620> more<00:01:59.860> with<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.070> back<00:02:00.220> door

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
just scoop more with the back door

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.450 
just scoop more with the back door
that's<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.170> really<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.800> just<00:02:03.100> watch<00:02:03.310> these

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
that's it really so just watch these

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.160 
that's it really so just watch these
examples<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.810> have<00:02:04.930> more<00:02:05.110> questions
