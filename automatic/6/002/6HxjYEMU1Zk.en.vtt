00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.730
 start 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.690
 evans the best I will be the big one that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.430
 you have advanced what I will use I will use 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.379
 the average cup 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.680
 how many things you had to put flour 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.990
 two then I will use four socks 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 cups because four half cups is 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.010
 equal to two cups 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.680
 well and then I'll put a dash of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.260
 yeast and a pinch of salt 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.630
 to make pizza you have to use the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.579
 strength flour that wheat flour 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.280
 hard 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.649
 I'm going to take a quarter of a teaspoon of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.159
 yeast and a quarter teaspoon of 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.590
 salt and when you finish mela 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 it can be the same all 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.610
 I'm going to remove that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.210
 very well mixed now I'm going to make a 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 today in the center fire of the mouth 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.040
 now 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.580
 little by little eh 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.360
 yes 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.740
 the water is warm that's good as well 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.740
 the massacre will be more 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.840
 I have put linen on the board so that the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.640
 dough does not stick and I've put oil 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.800
 olive in my hands so that I do not get 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.980
 paste the dough the hands 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 Now I'm going to take the pen that I'm going to 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.820
 throwing 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.870
 yes 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.830
 as we give is very wet I'm going to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.460
 throw a little flour so that it arrives 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.430
 to consistency like that and I'm giving it a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.070
 right area look I already have my mass 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.260
 ready I'm also going to wrap it 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.180
 in a film so that nothing crushes the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.640
 rest 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.800
 we do not have to put it too tight 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.440
 because it's going to grow 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.560
 you know what my great grandmother said that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.220
 track mass is like 9 you have to steal the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.220
 and let it rest 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.280
 look at a dryness of a home of yours 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 Miranda had grown 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.840
 and I will pass this 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.420
 how well it smells we are going to stretch the well 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.349
 and we put a handful of flour on the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.349
 table 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.530
 so and now we take the roller and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.530
 we started to shape 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.069
 from top to bottom 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.829
 the masses have grown by yeast 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.519
 to which good form has yours is 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.519
 redondita 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.200
 look we are going to do these stories but you 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.200
 they cut the division 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.520
 I am already finishing giving shape to 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.520
 mine 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.810
 when looking , I already have an I also like 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.939
 you have to create the moment mass before 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.760
 put the ingredients I will go 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.760
 placing the pizzas here 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.350
 you like the tomato if then we will throw 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.690
 much 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.290
 You leave an edge to grab 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.020
 the pizza looks I'm adding ham 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.900
 from york to pizzas 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.380
 then we will throw the cheese and over 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.810
 sand when the chips are ready 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.170
 We'll take oregano previously because 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.170
