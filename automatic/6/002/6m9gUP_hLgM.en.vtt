pieces<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> 11<00:00:15.120> would<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.599> like<00:00:15.960> let's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
pieces so the 11 would be like let's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.140 
pieces so the 11 would be like let's
start<00:00:16.560> simple<00:00:16.740> start<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.490> something<00:00:17.640> normal

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
with few variations and it's really

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.459 
with few variations and it's really
making<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.040> world<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.790> much<00:00:32.969> fun<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> 11

like this very much anymore lost most of
my<00:04:42.500> chops<00:04:47.590> now<00:04:48.590> see<00:04:48.770> with<00:04:48.890> 11<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.430> could<00:04:49.580> put

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
my chops now see with 11 you could put

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.280

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:31.610 

so<00:05:25.349> let's<00:05:25.529> just<00:05:25.589> use<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.009> 24<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.520> 11<00:05:30.620> let's

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
so let's just use the 24 the 11 let's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.009 
so let's just use the 24 the 11 let's
simplify
