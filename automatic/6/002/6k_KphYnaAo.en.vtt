ran in a distance because it's kind of
hard<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.710> tell<00:04:39.890> because<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.280> mean<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.490> can

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
hard to tell because I mean you can

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.510 
hard to tell because I mean you can
guess<00:04:41.080> guesstimate<00:04:42.080> how<00:04:42.320> far<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.890> do<00:04:43.040> run<00:04:43.220> but

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
guess guesstimate how far you do run but

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.160 
guess guesstimate how far you do run but
this<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:43.970> very<00:04:44.210> accurate<00:04:44.450> because<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:44.990> turns

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
this is very accurate because it turns

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.790 
this is very accurate because it turns
on<00:04:45.350> like<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.650> GPS<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.080> navigation<00:04:48.530> on

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
on like the GPS and the navigation on

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.170 
on like the GPS and the navigation on
your<00:04:48.980> phone<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.580> make<00:04:49.760> sure<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.060> you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
your phone just to make sure that you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.870 
your phone just to make sure that you
have<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.630> accurate<00:04:51.340> depiction<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.490> time

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
have like the accurate depiction of time

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.880 
have like the accurate depiction of time
and<00:04:53.360> distance<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.290> think<00:04:54.440> that's<00:04:54.740> really

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
and distance so I think that's really

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.440 
and distance so I think that's really
cool<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.190> even<00:04:55.460> nothing<00:04:55.580> tells<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.120> like<00:04:56.300> the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
cool and even nothing tells you like the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.850 
cool and even nothing tells you like the
amount<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.690> calories<00:04:57.140> or<00:04:57.290> something<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.710> burn

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
amount of calories or something you burn

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.010 
amount of calories or something you burn
on<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.250> run<00:04:58.460> which<00:04:58.940> i<00:04:59.090> think<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.390> pretty<00:04:59.660> cool

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
on that run which i think is pretty cool

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.090 
on that run which i think is pretty cool
that's<00:05:00.650> what<00:05:00.890> it<00:05:00.980> looks<00:05:01.160> like<00:05:01.930> right<00:05:02.930> there<00:05:03.169> so

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
that's what it looks like right there so

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.010 
that's what it looks like right there so
that's<00:05:04.340> pretty<00:05:04.490> much<00:05:04.580> my<00:05:04.730> favorite<00:05:05.240> apps<00:05:05.390> it's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that's pretty much my favorite apps it's

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990 
that's pretty much my favorite apps it's
pretty<00:05:06.260> easy<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.950> don't<00:05:07.340> really<00:05:07.490> have<00:05:07.669> any<00:05:07.850> like

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000
