 narrative usually have a presentation 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.230
 a conflict and an outcome even 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.760
 videogames that are not considered 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.650

 enemies to end the evil villain or 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.900
 eliminate the enemy army however 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.279
 Japanese logic is quite difficult 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.349
 to continue for our customs 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.849
 Westerners resulting in several 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.449
 videogames that look like they come from a 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.609
 bad dream 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.320
 some designed for adults others wrong 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.300
 proposed for children here you 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.370
 we will show 5 Japanese video games that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 they do not make any sense and they become 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.090
 quite disturbing we start the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.420
 travel but we do not take care of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.730
 the consequences number 5 taxis silence 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.350
 for nintendo a game that emulates life 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.420
 everyday and gives us the freedom of action 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.100
 would be quite successful today when 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.110
 That seems to be the formula for many 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.840
 popular titles however it was all 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.730
 an experience in 1986 the result was 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.470
 a rather strange adventure where to 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.450
 to win we needed to destroy 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.010
 our life giving us alcohol 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.970
 abandoning our wife and leaving 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 our work 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 all that resorting to violence 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.310
 punching jump of what we are 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.640
 crossing that yes between casey charl cove 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.530
 is what 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.409
 and everything seems to play against us 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.600
 number 4 ls the brain muleiro for the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.190
 playstation here we are clearly faced 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 a rather ambiguous case with a game 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.369
 that could be considered as an apology for 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.350
 the drugs but at the same time 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.660
 It turns out to be an alternative 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.490
 healthy that will test the lsd if we 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.350
 we left with its subtitle simply it 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 it's about a dream simulator but 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.500
 taking the complete piece we 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.229
 we face a quite experience 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.150
 quirky lcd crusher is a journey through 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.220
 moment 5 of the ico but with its 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.659
 counterpart more gloomy experience 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.700
 that the most impressionable sure them 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.460
 will give more than one scare giving each player 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.869
 your own interpretation to these dreams 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.369
 symbolism introspection and the terror of 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.770
 meet with the mysterious man of 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.360
 mostly gray a simple game based 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 in the dreams of your developer that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.570
 As we can see, it did not miss out 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.240
 the opportunity to move your 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.009
 traumas number 3 mister mosquitos for 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.050
 the playstation 2 nothing is so fascinating 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.420
 as a simulation game especially 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.950
 when we emulate the life of a mosquito or 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 at least that's what your 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.580
 creators and interestingly in japan he managed 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 cause sensation and get pretty 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 popularity mosquitoes are one of the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.860
 most annoying insects and that's the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.220
 main attraction of this game that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 might 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.300
 consider vaguely within the genre 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 stealth missions on the other hand jumps to

 nintendo 64 under the animated leader title 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.170
 its vigor is one of the most games 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.270
 strange that have been published for the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.040
 console game club the supremacy of the most 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.110
 strong is clearly the leitmotiv of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.880
 this game that mixes pure violence of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.920
 it lasts with animals that look like they come out 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.690
 of the minecraft universe we started with a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.190
 always must the cube pig our 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.959
 mission will be to destroy and eat each 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
 to be alive that crosses our path 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.650
 ascending to the top in the chain 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.120
 food a game rated as 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.650
 Suitable for all audiences even when 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.330
 part of the mechanics of the game is 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.950
 reward our task with females 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.959
 willing to copulate with our 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.200
 character that is consecrated as a male 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.200
 alpha 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.920
 number 1 esther mind on 23 of time now 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.750
 for the pc a video game with this 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.610
 trailer is already to take into account as 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.500
 one of the strangest and if we have 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.660
 some common sense keep it away 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.950
 of our scope in store main is the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.990
 search for a character for his soul 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 lost while using the soul of a friend 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.560
 that I borrow for a few hours the 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.150
 thing is that the soul is lost the island 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.950
 from tongzhou that turns out to be a star 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.810
 head green and in which 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.100
 We can not only walk and walk without 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 enter through their holes 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.550
 I've been thinking its creator a game 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.080
 where to die makes us reincarnate 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.430
 other characters including some that 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.170
 as soon as incarnated they take us to the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.610
 instantaneous death other than what 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 you were asking the creator of this 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.540
 game also participated in the development 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.220
 from lcd print simulator nothing but 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260
