00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
Portable 3rd it actually was probably a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.630 
Portable 3rd it actually was probably a
really<00:00:30.029> good<00:00:30.150> standby<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> mine<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.640> monster

really good standby of mine in monster
hunter<00:00:32.850> tri<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.920> what<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.100> defines

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
hunter tri as well what really defines

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.270 
hunter tri as well what really defines
it<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.969> its<00:00:36.239> rapid<00:00:36.870> fire<00:00:37.050> ability<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.890> for

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it is its rapid fire ability which for

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.549 
it is its rapid fire ability which for
this<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> has<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> rapid<00:00:39.300> fire<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.809> paralysis

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this it has a rapid fire on paralysis

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.979 
this it has a rapid fire on paralysis
and<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.980> Pierce<00:00:41.809> unfortunately<00:00:42.809> there's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and on Pierce unfortunately there's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.990 
and on Pierce unfortunately there's
quite<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> kick<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.610> bug<00:00:44.850> on

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
quite a kick back with this bug on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
quite a kick back with this bug on
there's<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.300> enough<00:00:45.510> recoil<00:00:45.960> reduction<00:00:47.120> so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
there's not enough recoil reduction so

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
there's not enough recoil reduction so
not<00:00:48.750> only<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.860> normal

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
not only can you not get off normal

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
not only can you not get off normal
status<00:00:50.520> shots<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.030> quickly<00:00:51.329> enough<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
status shots off quickly enough but the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
status shots off quickly enough but the
weapons<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.520> better<00:00:54.059> rapid

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
weapons that you do have better rapid

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.389 
weapons that you do have better rapid
fire<00:00:54.829> aren't<00:00:55.829> really<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> effective

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fire aren't really all that effective

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.810 
fire aren't really all that effective
either<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> start<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> get

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
either so to start with I'm going to get

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
either so to start with I'm going to get
some<00:01:02.969> poison<00:01:03.359> shots<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:04.070> may<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.129> well<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> at

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
some poison shots off may as well get at

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
some poison shots off may as well get at
least<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:06.119> application<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.840> every<00:01:07.080> status

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
least one application of every status

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
least one application of every status
that<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> guy<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.540> can

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that you can off on a guy if you can

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.130 
that you can off on a guy if you can
actually<00:01:09.990> fire<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> shots<00:01:11.810> if<00:01:12.810> late<00:01:12.960> does

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
actually fire the shots if late does

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
actually fire the shots if late does
around<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.680> damage<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.159> believe<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
around the same damage I believe as a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.700 
around the same damage I believe as a
large<00:01:15.180> barrel<00:01:15.630> bomb<00:01:15.810> plus<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> shots<00:01:18.330> do

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
large barrel bomb plus and the shots do

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.999 
large barrel bomb plus and the shots do
pretty<00:01:19.710> ok<00:01:20.040> damage<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.680> know<00:01:22.680> they're

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pretty ok damage as well I know they're

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
pretty ok damage as well I know they're
almost<00:01:23.280> comparable<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.150> normal<00:01:24.479> two<00:01:24.659> shots<00:01:24.960> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
almost comparable to normal two shots so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.510 
almost comparable to normal two shots so
it's<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> complete<00:01:26.100> waste

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.819 

so<00:01:34.180> my<00:01:34.299> goal<00:01:34.479> here<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.899> I'm<00:01:35.020> gonna<00:01:35.140> try<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:35.679> get

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
so my goal here is I'm gonna try and get

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.300 
so my goal here is I'm gonna try and get
off<00:01:36.009> as<00:01:36.250> many<00:01:37.439> status<00:01:38.439> locking<00:01:38.799> effects<00:01:39.130> on

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
off as many status locking effects on

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.850 
off as many status locking effects on
him<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:40.539> just<00:01:40.689> start<00:01:41.049> spamming<00:01:41.380> normal

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
him and then just start spamming normal

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.490 
him and then just start spamming normal
shots<00:01:42.100> off<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.369> his<00:01:42.700> face<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.350> reason

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
shots off on his face and the reason

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.990 
shots off on his face and the reason
that<00:01:44.619> I'm<00:01:44.799> doing<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.130> rather<00:01:45.399> than<00:01:45.520> fires

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
that I'm doing that rather than fires

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.120 
that I'm doing that rather than fires
because<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.960> cliq<00:01:47.289> for<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.560> normal<00:01:47.860> two<00:01:47.979> is

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
because the cliq for the normal two is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.490 
because the cliq for the normal two is
just<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.399> much<00:01:48.549> larger<00:01:49.000> there's<00:01:49.960> six<00:01:50.289> shots

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
just that much larger there's six shots

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.249 
just that much larger there's six shots
here<00:01:50.920> as<00:01:51.100> opposed<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.689> four<00:01:52.990> shots

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
here as opposed to just the four shots

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.600 
here as opposed to just the four shots
from<00:01:53.469> fire<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:53.979> even<00:01:54.159> though<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.310> fire<00:01:54.429> it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
from fire so even though the fire it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.639 
from fire so even though the fire it
might<00:01:54.759> be<00:01:54.969> slightly<00:01:55.299> better<00:01:55.539> damage<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.229> could

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
might be slightly better damage I could

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.980 
might be slightly better damage I could
use<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:56.890> at<00:01:57.130> more<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:57.429> a<00:01:57.610> long-range<00:01:58.030> finale<00:01:58.840> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
use it at more of a long-range finale to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.940 
use it at more of a long-range finale to
normal<00:02:01.990> too<00:02:02.110> while<00:02:02.289> he's<00:02:02.439> not<00:02:02.590> really<00:02:02.770> all

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
normal too while he's not really all

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.160 
normal too while he's not really all
that<00:02:02.979> enraged<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.750> me<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.899> lot<00:02:05.049> more

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
that enraged we get me a lot more
