point I'm though I admit they could have
done<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.750> tiny<00:04:49.260> bit<00:04:49.590> better<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.460> pretty

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
done a tiny bit better this is pretty

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.330 
done a tiny bit better this is pretty
good<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.450> think<00:04:52.440> they<00:04:52.590> should<00:04:52.830> have<00:04:52.860> add<00:04:53.100> more

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
good I think they should have add more

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.040 
good I think they should have add more
buildings<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.850> make<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> death<00:04:54.390> City<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:54.930> not

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
buildings to make a death City and not

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.940
