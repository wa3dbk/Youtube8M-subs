00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.639
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.950
 make a very advent crown 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.680
 simple to realize that everyone 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.550
 will be able to make small as the big 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.779
 crown will be will be made so its 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:31.019
 base from a salt dough and so 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.840
 then will be decorated afterwards so the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.899
 first step will be to make the dough 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 to salt what will it take so he 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:52.910
 you will need a container the flour of the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.949
 salt and water 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 so here's how to make our dough 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.660
 salt 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.970
 first of all what your container and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:14.119
 came to put flour worms on it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.119
 take safari there is but a v12 has 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.049
 lifted 1 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.049
 so after you look at the quantities 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 if you want your your crown 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.740
 do not over-sell on big 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:45.270
 their like this one take half of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 half in winter once your two 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 glasses of fans come nor to flour 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.229
 place in your salad bowl come come 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.100
 take your saddle and put it there 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.979
 universe of salt so everything always depends 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 quantities if if you want a 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.770
 big a big crown m patents 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.070
 nation reflection is on the move 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.770
 put back more than half but that's 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.930
 always too well depending on whether the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.690
 your father is always small masters of 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.790
 reverse flour mealworms 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.970
 of that and a glass of water they are 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.780
 quantities to m so here's a winter of 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.160
 200 or put that flour height and 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:45.550
 you come to mix the two ingredients 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.550
 so to mix them 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 after having a good mix of your CV 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.940
 your flour 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.090
 fill your glass in half with 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.210
 water and then started to incorporate this 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.240
 water with the flour and serves well on 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:10.670
 two legs not all shed 20 strokes 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.220
 then you have to work your 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.000
 flour and your saddle with your de 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.000
 so to give a ball 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:29.880
 here is pour water and salt water 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.880
 rather little when you need it 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:39.840
 once your dough is well formed and that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.840
 all the ingredients are well mix 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.580
 finished it is good to knead it for him 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:58.420
 give a good shape good voila like 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:01.870
 this put it in a tupperware gear 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.930
 a bag and a wallet sheltered from 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.040
 the air so they do not try because if 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.040
 you put it in the air 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.970
 Well it remained dry and therefore 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.940
 harden it will no longer be possible 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.010
 will not be possible then to use it 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.510
 here you put it in a bag in 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:33.160
 anything to prevent it from being 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:37.050
 in contact with land waiting for 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.050
 make your base to be able to continue 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 after about 20 minutes 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.090
 I'm not rest must draw 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.090
 the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:57.810
 it's your pack 2 of your any 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.330
 what and you are going to come make a 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.170
 so be careful with a pudding you go 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:10.860
 come as those ci rolled it so to 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:13.320
 give a long end of a bitter finally 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.340
 your blood sausage on a white sheet what 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.650
 paper made to a 2 9 cm round of 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.200
 diameter so using a compass like 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:34.880
 these then came to spend your 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:34.880
 boudin all around like this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.800
 trying for years as a form 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.800
 it 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.960
 here once again besides boudin place and 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:06.409
 came to take four candles 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:12.710
 so gentlemen of four candles and 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:14.949
 place them on the crown so marc 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.909
 shoot like that if we french the goods 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.050
 which you put 4 like that where were 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:32.860
 the parks for you put the boats 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:32.860
 his hat like that 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.170
 and for the dough to take take 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.110
 well form was waiting 5 minutes then 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.810
 removed then came to put your 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.790
 advent wreath on a plate or 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.500
 does cooking and magnifying glass on the 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.890
 avenue for not only after 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.170
 that she is cooked she does not stick to the 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.400
 plate and so she breaks it 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.440
 completely that she classifies you 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.210
 completely here is your your marks 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.300
 and you can let them cook in at 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:05.850
 oven for two hours at 130 Â° so 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.040
 after baking your your crown 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.180
 Here is the result 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.180
 so we can see that the marks are 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.370
 always there and you can re place and 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.200
 so your your four candles on them 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.720
 marks so and will be good 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.500
 like that 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.170
 what I forgot to tell you 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.370
 is that you can also leave 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.860
 harden the dough in the air but without the 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.690
 cook but it will last a long time 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.070
 so there after you can watch I do not 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.840
 do not know too much, I do not have much time 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.790
 it takes without cooking, leaving 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.650
 to go but I know it's possible 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.450
 so that must take in both three 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.770
 hours I think so too 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.710
 or maybe four even a little more 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.450
 so that's the same you can plant there 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.630
 decorations like stars 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.240
 anything and that will go dry with 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.170
 so it will be incrusted with time 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.650
 after you can of course you can 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.980
 decorated with paint 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:04.170
 m a drawing in the middle 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.580
 lacoste museum to your choice to your desires 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.840
 and so that's it so I leave you 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.920
 wish good luck to achieve this 

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.920
 and I'll see you soon
