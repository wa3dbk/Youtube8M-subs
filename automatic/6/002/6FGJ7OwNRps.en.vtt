the<00:00:23.039> point<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> puzzle<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.179> move<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the point of this puzzle is to move the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.829 
the point of this puzzle is to move the
Sun<00:00:25.470> represented<00:00:26.429> by<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> white<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.660> dot

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
Sun represented by the white little dot

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.380 
Sun represented by the white little dot
here<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:29.130> actually<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> somehow

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
here you actually have to get it somehow

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.480 
here you actually have to get it somehow
to<00:00:30.509> slide<00:00:30.960> through<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.769> bottom<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> box

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
to slide through the bottom of the box

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.520 
to slide through the bottom of the box
so<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> know<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.930> first<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.380> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so you know when you first look at this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.310 
so you know when you first look at this
thing<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.220> seems<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> impossible<00:00:36.320> you

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thing it seems kind of impossible you

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
thing it seems kind of impossible you
know<00:00:37.379> it's<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.680> okay<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.940> all<00:00:39.000> these

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
know it's like okay if I all these

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.479 
know it's like okay if I all these
blocks<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:39.899> am<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.050> gonna<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
blocks in the way how am I gonna do that

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.299 
blocks in the way how am I gonna do that
well<00:00:41.489> actually<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.719> about<00:00:43.020> 40<00:00:43.590> steps<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
well actually in about 40 steps or so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.459 
well actually in about 40 steps or so
it's<00:00:44.520> possible<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:45.840> gonna<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.320> how

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it's possible so I'm gonna show you how

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.200 
it's possible so I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.739> today

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
to do that today

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.549 
to do that today
basically<00:00:48.210> how<00:00:48.359> I<00:00:48.390> solve<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.230> by

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
basically how I solve this is by

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
basically how I solve this is by
memorizing<00:00:49.980> different<00:00:50.730> positions<00:00:51.239> I'm

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
memorizing different positions I'm

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.170 
memorizing different positions I'm
actually<00:00:51.980> was<00:00:52.980> fooling<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
actually was fooling around with it and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.569 
actually was fooling around with it and
I<00:00:54.719> said<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.739> why<00:00:55.859> don't<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.100> work<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I said you know why don't I work this

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
I said you know why don't I work this
thing<00:00:56.789> backwards<00:00:57.140> basically<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> set<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.280> as

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
thing backwards basically I set it up as

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.950 
thing backwards basically I set it up as
I<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.269> seen<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I would have you know seen it as a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
I would have you know seen it as a
solution<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.769> then<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.250> worked<00:01:02.429> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
solution and then I just worked it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
solution and then I just worked it
backwards<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.120> figured<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.929> way

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
backwards and figured it out that way

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
backwards and figured it out that way
all<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.640> goes<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> first<00:01:06.270> we're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
all right so here goes so first we're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.130 
all right so here goes so first we're
gonna<00:01:06.480> set<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:08.009> few<00:01:08.790> things<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:12.140> basically

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
gonna set up a few things here basically

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.270 
gonna set up a few things here basically
what<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:14.270> you'll<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> second

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
what I'm doing you'll see in a second

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
what I'm doing you'll see in a second
here<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:20.840> getting<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> position<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> remember

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
here is getting a position so I remember

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
here is getting a position so I remember
this<00:01:23.070> position<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.850> had<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.630> black<00:01:25.079> dots

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this position I had the two black dots

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.670 
this position I had the two black dots
there<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.329> remembered<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> okay<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.380> the

now what I want to do is I'm gonna

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.050 
now what I want to do is I'm gonna
switch<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.130> have<00:02:10.429> these<00:02:10.610> two<00:02:10.850> right<00:02:11.030> here

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
switch so I have these two right here

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.850 
switch so I have these two right here
and<00:02:11.540> I'm<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:11.870> gonna<00:02:11.959> switch<00:02:12.290> them<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and I'm just gonna switch them up a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.470 
and I'm just gonna switch them up a
little<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:16.000> they're<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.120> on

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
little bit so that they're actually on

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.410 
little bit so that they're actually on
the<00:02:17.600> other<00:02:17.780> side<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.850> got<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> fun<00:02:20.300> little

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the other side it's got a fun little

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.699 
the other side it's got a fun little
game<00:02:20.570> after<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.830> used<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
game after you get used to it so now the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.310 
game after you get used to it so now the
next<00:02:28.310> position<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.060> remember<00:02:29.420> was

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
next position that I remember was

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.990 
next position that I remember was
basically<00:02:30.709> with<00:02:30.800> these<00:02:30.920> two<00:02:31.130> dread<00:02:31.430> dots<00:02:31.700> up

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
basically with these two dread dots up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.600 
basically with these two dread dots up
here<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.380> trying<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.070> them<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.370> here

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
here so trying to get them up here

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.290 
here so trying to get them up here
basically<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.800> rotate<00:02:36.800> them<00:02:37.220> around

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.530 

it<00:02:41.300> seems<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.750> forever<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.970> keep<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.450> in

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
it seems like forever you keep going in
