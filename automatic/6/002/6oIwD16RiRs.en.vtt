 a bootcamp video 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.050
 I was in this weekend 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.759
 berlin at the studio seventeen bootcamp 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.919
 that was such an action where several 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.070
 new studies timon youtuber met 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.330

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.920

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.839
 So it was a really cool action 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.610

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.180

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.540

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 Video movie to turn a channel 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.830

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.250

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.950

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.630
 take the time for my channel video 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.369
 because I'm cool that's what they do 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.409
 and yes there is that 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.240
 thumbs of mine was not much 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.650
 but he gets it anyway 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.790
 If I have been there I have 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.470
 thought why not a few 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.790
 smaller youtubers still support that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.440
 Do not have too many subscribers 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.440
 and yes I did that too 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.349
 we drive 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.160
 what do you say to austrian market 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.370
 It would be great that there are some 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.500
 people today quasi the law on the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.530
 help jumps and punish people though 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.410
 it is necessary that it's okay just that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.840
 admitted camera sends and agrees that 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.340
 it during photo michael buchinger at 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.049
 the Austrian mafia if you want that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.450
 as a video title takes you get 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:10.900
 yes many clicks finally short I am 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.900
 briefly away 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:21.510
 it says you wanted you should not 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.730
 filming on edge and I had the chance 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.590
 at the entertainment video of mine 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.330
 group a bit in the story 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.459
 to participate and I was also twice 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:36.900
 to see for once here and 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.390
 One time here what you do not notice 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.220
 is that does us very little money and has 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.780
 You can tell that from the books 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.350
 gets there with 1 studios 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.660
 struggling for good but that's not enough 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.209
 money for the ink and therefore the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.209
 an empty book moderation 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.569
 This is 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 Yes 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.250
 I just do a permanent loop 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.500
 how do you do this moderation you ne 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.970
 lasts for ten hours 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.650
 Thanks for watching my boat 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.840
 camp video it is not so 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.460
 extensive but I thought so 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.720
 I only do a short video where you can 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.340
 maybe a few impressions and sees 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.570
 so you can get the bootcamp 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.130
 videos from the other participants 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.170
 I'll look at that in the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.270
 description then somehow link 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.410
 if they got out there and I 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.390
 I wanted to say that again 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.310
 boot camp was a really cool action 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.230
 the other youtubers were all cool 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.740
 everyone was so nice 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.110
 people in one place that was amazing 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.430
 and that nobody cared for me 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.840
 although I have so many people with the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.890
 my camera got on my nerves 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.530
 that also has me a bit 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.140
 surprised and more so was totally nice 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.720
 people were cool people and sympathetic 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.130
 all and I hope that the whole 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.290
 Repeated is definitely powerful 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.820
