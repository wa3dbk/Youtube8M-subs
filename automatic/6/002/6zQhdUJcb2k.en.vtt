jumper it was a big game for them so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.730 
jumper it was a big game for them so
let's<00:00:15.509> break<00:00:15.750> down<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.080> move<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> first

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
let's break down the move so the first

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.480 
let's break down the move so the first
thing<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.670> curry<00:00:17.910> does<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:19.010> he<00:00:20.010> does<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> great

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
thing that curry does is he does a great

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.849 
thing that curry does is he does a great
job<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:21.210> penetrating<00:00:22.020> towards<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> basket

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
job at penetrating towards the basket

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980 
job at penetrating towards the basket
now<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> players<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.660> drive

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
now a lot of players when they drive

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.650 
now a lot of players when they drive
they<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> side<00:00:26.880> which

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
they go kind of to the side which

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.450 
they go kind of to the side which
prevents<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.470> getting<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.279> lane

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
prevents them from getting into the lane

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
prevents them from getting into the lane
that's<00:00:29.670> easy<00:00:30.029> if<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> ever<00:00:30.960> watch<00:00:31.170> curry<00:00:31.529> when

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that's easy if you ever watch curry when

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
that's easy if you ever watch curry when
he<00:00:31.830> comes<00:00:32.040> off<00:00:32.219> screens<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:32.940> even<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.660> he<00:00:33.750> just

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
he comes off screens or even if he just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.049 
he comes off screens or even if he just
gets<00:00:34.079> by<00:00:34.290> his<00:00:34.469> defender<00:00:35.010> he<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.910> like

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
gets by his defender he kind of like

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
gets by his defender he kind of like
dips<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.480> shoulder<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> he's<00:00:37.680> going

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dips that shoulder and he's going

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.700 
dips that shoulder and he's going
straight<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> middle<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> sets<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
straight to the middle so this sets up a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
straight to the middle so this sets up a
lot<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.340> moves<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.760> him<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
lot of different moves for him and this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
lot of different moves for him and this
is<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.450> he's<00:00:43.020> able<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.770> many<00:00:43.890> easy

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is how he's able to get so many easy

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.420 
is how he's able to get so many easy
step<00:00:44.670> backs<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.829> move<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.280> did

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
step backs and then the move that he did

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240 
step backs and then the move that he did
a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.640> Bron<00:00:47.850> James<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.800> watch<00:00:49.980> him

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
a little Bron James so if you watch him

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
a little Bron James so if you watch him
he<00:00:50.370> does<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.210> move<00:00:51.449> where<00:00:51.690> his

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
he does a lot of this move where his

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
he does a lot of this move where his
defenders<00:00:52.289> riding<00:00:52.649> him<00:00:52.770> hard<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.460> he'll<00:00:53.820> do

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
defenders riding him hard and he'll do

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.200 
defenders riding him hard and he'll do
that<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.809> spin<00:00:55.199> move<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> I've<00:00:56.640> taught

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that little spin move so I've taught

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
that little spin move so I've taught
this<00:00:57.390> spin<00:00:57.600> move<00:00:57.780> before<00:00:58.079> you've<00:00:58.199> probably

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this spin move before you've probably

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
this spin move before you've probably
seen<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> videos<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.789> break<00:01:00.719> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
seen in one of the videos I break this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
seen in one of the videos I break this
down<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> great<00:01:02.219> move<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
down a lot and this is a great move for

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.590 
down a lot and this is a great move for
guards<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.860> simple<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:06.090> use

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
guards to do it's very simple you use

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.660 
guards to do it's very simple you use
your<00:01:06.630> defender<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.430> spin

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
your defender and then you just spin

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
your defender and then you just spin
right<00:01:08.880> off<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> drop<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.810> ball<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
right off them and you drop the ball so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.380 
right off them and you drop the ball so
I'm<00:01:11.220> dropping<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.210> protect

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I'm dropping so that way you can protect

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
I'm dropping so that way you can protect
the<00:01:12.689> ball<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> always<00:01:13.290> keep<00:01:13.439> yourself<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the ball you always keep yourself in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.840 
the ball you always keep yourself in
between<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> ball<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.049> man<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> instead

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
between the ball and your man so instead

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
between the ball and your man so instead
of<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.150> spinning<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.229> dropping

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
of just spinning like this and dropping

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.260 
of just spinning like this and dropping
the<00:01:19.590> ball<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.340> where<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:21.060> take

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the ball over here where you could take

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
the ball over here where you could take
it<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.900> spin<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.409> drop<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> ball<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.490> here

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it you spin and drop the ball over here

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200 
it you spin and drop the ball over here
so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> basket<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.030> more

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so you can get to the basket so one more

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
so you can get to the basket so one more
time<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.290> could<00:01:28.350> drop<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
time so if I'm going I could drop that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.179 
time so if I'm going I could drop that
way<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> basket<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.770> curry<00:01:31.950> did

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
way get to the basket so what curry did

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
way get to the basket so what curry did
here<00:01:32.610> another<00:01:33.210> thing<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.140> instead

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
here another thing you can do is instead

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.580 
here another thing you can do is instead
of<00:01:34.530> taking<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.920> dribble<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.119> drive

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
of taking that dribble you can drive
