00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
not really know what I'm I do here I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
not really know what I'm I do here I
kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> made<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> house<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> middle<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of made a house in the middle of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
kind of made a house in the middle of
the<00:00:44.129> ocean<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the ocean but that's because if that is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.529 
the ocean but that's because if that is
koo<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.610> don't<00:00:47.789> know<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.180> it's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
koo and I don't know what this is it's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
koo and I don't know what this is it's
just<00:00:48.629> some<00:00:48.960> fire<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.739> middle<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.340> house

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
just some fire in the middle of my house

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.900 
just some fire in the middle of my house
not<00:00:51.719> fired<00:00:51.989> does<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.460> some<00:00:53.640> fire

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
not fired does some water with some fire

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
not fired does some water with some fire
which<00:00:54.180> obviously<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.559> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
which obviously I think if it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
which obviously I think if it's
underwater<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.789> fire<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.780> but

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
underwater that fire would go out but

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
underwater that fire would go out but
you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:59.070> these<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.579> these

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you know with these little these

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240 
you know with these little these
graphics<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
graphics I'm not so sure about that and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.380 
graphics I'm not so sure about that and
this<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:04.470> glass<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.280 
eventually i'll get this closed off but
it's<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> hard<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.960> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it's kind of hard because it's it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.850 
it's kind of hard because it's it's
super<00:01:46.799> deep<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.509> might<00:01:49.200> take<00:01:49.229> me<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> while

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
super deep so it might take me a while

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.969 
super deep so it might take me a while
to<00:01:49.920> actually<00:01:50.399> finish<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.930> i'll<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.890> it

this<00:02:10.380> minecraft<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.100> I'm<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.400> supposed<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
this minecraft that I'm not supposed to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.210 
this minecraft that I'm not supposed to
be<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> other<00:02:13.590> secretaries<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.040> my

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
be on the other secretaries in my

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.370 
be on the other secretaries in my
account<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:15.180> probably<00:02:15.420> why<00:02:15.840> I'm

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
account so that's probably why I'm

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.590 
account so that's probably why I'm
thinking<00:02:16.740> about<00:02:16.920> buying<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.370> 20<00:02:17.700> euros<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.210> 15

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
thinking about buying it 20 euros or 15

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.390 
thinking about buying it 20 euros or 15
euros<00:02:18.870> i<00:02:18.990> think<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:20.070> what<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
euros i think it is that's what it is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.960 
euros i think it is that's what it is
yeah<00:02:20.940> whatever<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.620> yeah<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.010> there's<00:02:23.460> this

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
i'm not sure if i'm going to switch my

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.330 
i'm not sure if i'm going to switch my
consoles<00:04:06.630> over<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:07.350> might<00:04:07.590> not<00:04:07.620> like<00:04:07.950> well

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340

yeah<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.519> guess<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.209> guess<00:04:09.480> that's<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:09.780> you

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
yeah I guess so I guess that's what you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.539 
yeah I guess so I guess that's what you
could<00:04:10.019> say<00:04:10.200> switch<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:10.650> consoles<00:04:11.100> over<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:11.519> I

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
could say switch my consoles over but I

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.640 
could say switch my consoles over but I
