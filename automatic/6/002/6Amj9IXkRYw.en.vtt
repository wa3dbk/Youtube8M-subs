00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
where we we have a controller just a

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.050 
where we we have a controller just a
little<00:01:25.289> mini<00:01:25.469> controller<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.189> each<00:01:26.310> corner

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
little mini controller for each corner

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.459 
little mini controller for each corner
of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> machine<00:01:27.479> each<00:01:27.630> leg<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> machine

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
of the machine each leg on the machine

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.889 
of the machine each leg on the machine
to<00:01:29.130> control<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.939> functions<00:01:30.359> that<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.539> that

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
to control the functions that are that

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.389 
to control the functions that are that
are<00:01:30.990> based<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.979> portion<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
are based out on that that portion of

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.310 
are based out on that that portion of
the<00:01:32.460> machine<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.270> another<00:01:33.539> cool<00:01:33.930> feature<00:01:34.109> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the machine now another cool feature is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.789 
the machine now another cool feature is
the<00:01:34.409> console<00:01:35.359> we<00:01:36.359> we've<00:01:36.899> redesigned<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the console we we've redesigned that the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.609 
the console we we've redesigned that the
framework<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.490> council<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.179> that<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
framework and the council so that the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.529 
framework and the council so that the
the<00:01:40.619> operator<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.549> reposition<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.179> console

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
the operator can reposition the console

and the electronics have been redesigned

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.780 
and the electronics have been redesigned
so<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.710> they're<00:02:40.830> much<00:02:40.980> easier<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> work<00:02:41.550> on

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
so that they're much easier to work on

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.470 
so that they're much easier to work on
and<00:02:42.560> they're<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:44.070> easier<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.490> access<00:02:44.730> what

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and they're much easier to access what

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.420 
and they're much easier to access what
has<00:02:45.570> been<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.840> reaction<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.010> feedback

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
has been the reaction and the feedback
you've<00:02:47.610> gotten<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:48.360> people<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.020> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you've gotten from people here have to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.230 
you've gotten from people here have to
show<00:02:49.350> about<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.830> community<00:02:50.250> 3<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.060> far

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
show about the community 3 well so far

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.270 
show about the community 3 well so far
it's<00:02:51.450> been<00:02:51.510> been<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:52.710> really<00:02:52.890> well

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
it's been been really what really well

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.370 
it's been been really what really well
received<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.970> our<00:02:54.480> biggest<00:02:54.630> problem<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.140> is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
received and our biggest problem is is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740 
received and our biggest problem is is
that<00:02:55.670> people<00:02:56.670> don't<00:02:57.210> want<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.480> wait<00:02:57.570> until

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
that people don't want to wait until

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.630 
that people don't want to wait until
fall<00:02:58.080> no<00:02:58.290> sir<00:02:58.530> hook<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> machine<00:02:59.220> they're

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
fall no sir hook up to a machine they're

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.580 
fall no sir hook up to a machine they're
still<00:03:00.330> spend<00:03:00.540> good<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.020> reaction<00:03:01.440> then

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
still spend good so the reaction then

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.130 
still spend good so the reaction then
from<00:03:01.860> them<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.460> your<00:03:03.240> vision<00:03:03.540> kind<00:03:04.080> of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
from them and that your vision kind of

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.750 
from them and that your vision kind of
came<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.410> life<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> show<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
came to life here at the show and the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.120 
came to life here at the show and the
