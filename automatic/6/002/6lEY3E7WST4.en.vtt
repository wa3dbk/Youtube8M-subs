00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.890
 deceased that is what is said now 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.040
 thanks to our agencies that we 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.830
 arrive 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.430
 those who come to us from santiago de 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.460
 compostela we observe trains of 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.810
 high speed as well as trains 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.570
 that have been downloaded a little more 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.390
 ancient you are the station from where 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.869
 you can board the passengers of madrid 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.649
 to ferrol where has happened then the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.649
 accident not 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.390
 we are going to expand without doubt the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.860
 image is this photograph as well as 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.220
 also the images that reach us 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.390
 thanks to this video of the trains in 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.120
 wherever where it definitely happened 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.829
 this accident we can observe that is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.329
 one of the stations where the 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.140
 passengers board trains 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.239
 what covers the route from madrid to ferrol 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.309
 they are pretty modern trains are trains 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.579
 high speed as we can see in 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.189
 the images that undoubtedly have 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.310
 derailed there in that curve between 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.890
 madrid and the ferrol images that we have 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 then that we get information 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.960
 thanks to the spanish media 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.630
 pretty clear images no doubt about 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.030
 these train lines because they have 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.830
 suffered this accident today in 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.399
 where at least ten people would have 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.670
 lost in life as you know a train 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.190
 it derailed in santiago de compostela 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.869
 and this is how we can be an information 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.340
 that we have the knowledge that at least ten 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.640
 people died though the authorities 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.920
 at the moment they can not confirm the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.860
 neither the real number of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.130
 deceased what we can see is 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.429
 this movement that was developing that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.009
 is developed in the train station of 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.560
 day by day as we can observe from 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.640
 normal way of passengers boarding 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.770
 certain hour 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.920
 It should also be noted that at eight o'clock 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.500
 and twenty hours beyond Spain 8 20 of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.810
 the night there is light for the same time by 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.119
 the summer is why in the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.640
 darkness because it has just arrived after 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.130
 nine of the night 9 and 30 of the night very 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 for this reason, at 10 o'clock at night 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.600
 that is seen with some clarity it looks like 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.000
 if it was day however being already 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.040
 night 20 of the night improved of the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.420
 train derailment looks pretty 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.420
 clear in the image 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.820
 images that we can observe then 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.130
 of one of the and one of the places in 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:44.180
 where after the train that is 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.180
 derailed from madrid to ferrol 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.569
 there are combined trains we do not see trains 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.489
 there they are modern that combine with 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.860
 the ancients there are people who take 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.780
 different routes too and we have been able 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.829
 observe then the consequences without a doubt 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.560
 from one of the trains this 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.799
 pretty strong derailment 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.690
 Shocking the image of the photo without a doubt 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.260
 of this train that has been derailed 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.989
 we can see good that 's 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.590
 no doubt images that we had 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.220
 then we are going to go back to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.579
 place virtually a video of these 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.670
 train model trains that are 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.370
 derailed 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.090
 on the curve from madrid to ferrol this 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.640
 from alvia is the station of stations 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.060
 alvia pontevedra 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.700
 where this train departed that derailed 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.620
 the santiago de compostela very close to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.020
 santiago de compostela where also 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.020
 at least 10 people died 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.620
 the authorities of the colony according to 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 we understand are where they are 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.580
 are moving to that place well for 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.950
 be able to start with the investigations and 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.040
 see the causes of this derailment 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.590
 in this curve on a route that went from 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.870
 Madrid to Ferrol 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.349
 that is the train and we can observe there in 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.349
 the images 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.910
 you download the is the train that is 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.550
 derailed in that curve on the route 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.450
 madrid that role 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.519
 the route is done day by day 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.610
 all passengers are addressed in this 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.180
 station either in madrid or in alvia and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.730
 normally and the route that is followed is the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.330
 of the usual route for this government train 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.460
 high speed however it still 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.400
 has been investigating the causes of this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.080
 new accident that undoubtedly tarnishes 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.270
 also the safety of 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.640
 railways in Europe because it's not the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.920
 first accident there has been another in 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.420
 France also recently and in other 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.730
 also in cities where they have 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.060
 derailed some high trains 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.900
 rather modern speed however 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.560
 Well, this is the one who does 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.270
 You could call it reduced to Spain 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.690
 again because in Spain they have also 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.250
 there were railway accidents and 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.070
 previously however on this route 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.590
 it had not been very common and let's hope 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.350
 that there is also no Peruvian in 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.330
 the list of deceased people inside 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.460
 of these people who would have died 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.320
 product of this derailment 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.229
 we are going to expand the information 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.389
 it's definitely later on we're going to have 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.270
 further expansion on this unfortunate 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.250
 news this unfortunate information and if 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.260
 is that it would already exist with the list of 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.130
 deceased surely thanks to the 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.130
 agencies of spain '
