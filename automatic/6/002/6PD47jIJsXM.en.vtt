two puts or something like that and it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420 
two puts or something like that and it's
got<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.350> thing<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> can't<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.220> tell

got that thing but you can't really tell

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
got that thing but you can't really tell
cuz<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> focus<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> know

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
cuz it's out of focus but you know

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
cuz it's out of focus but you know
whatever<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> newer<00:01:41.729> model<00:01:41.970> comes<00:01:42.420> with

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
whatever I got a newer model comes with

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.749 
whatever I got a newer model comes with
one<00:01:42.720> listen<00:01:43.020> focus<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.829> by<00:01:44.009> Mario<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
one listen focus so it's by Mario and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
one listen focus so it's by Mario and
they<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:46.350> buttons<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.159> think

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
they have some buttons and I think

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
they have some buttons and I think
that's<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> picture<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.270> headphones

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that's like a picture of headphones

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.640 
that's like a picture of headphones
right<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
right there you can see that

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.770 
right there you can see that
you<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.190> use<00:01:51.730> your<00:01:51.880> headphones<00:01:52.330> I<00:01:52.480> got<00:01:52.630> these

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
you can use your headphones I got these

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.330 
you can use your headphones I got these
ones<00:01:53.080> they're<00:01:53.230> pretty<00:01:53.530> good<00:01:53.650> they're<00:01:53.710> by<00:01:53.980> I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
ones they're pretty good they're by I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.690 
ones they're pretty good they're by I
think<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.240> also<00:01:55.360> like<00:01:55.720> Mario<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:57.430> comes

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
think it's also like Mario and it comes

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.340 
think it's also like Mario and it comes
with<00:01:57.910> this<00:01:58.030> cables<00:01:58.570> I<00:01:58.780> think<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.080> is<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.320> a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
with this cables I think this is like a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.560 
with this cables I think this is like a
fun<00:01:59.650> game<00:01:59.890> or<00:02:00.070> something<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.330> attach

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
fun game or something so you can attach

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.800 
fun game or something so you can attach
