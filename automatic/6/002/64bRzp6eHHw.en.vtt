00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
professional so it was nothing

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
professional so it was nothing
distracting<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
distracting because as you can see if I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
distracting because as you can see if I
didn't<00:01:02.519> have<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.090> older<00:01:03.480> videos

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
didn't have them up with my older videos

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
didn't have them up with my older videos
there's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> distracting<00:01:05.550> stuff<00:01:05.790> here

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
but since I start putting them up I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.540 
but since I start putting them up I
think<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> videos<00:01:08.940> look<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.420> better<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
think the videos look a lot better so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.510

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
videos to try and diminish the glare but

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.559 
videos to try and diminish the glare but
it<00:02:35.430> usually<00:02:35.640> doesn't<00:02:35.849> make<00:02:36.209> too<00:02:36.330> much<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
it usually doesn't make too much of a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.850 
it usually doesn't make too much of a
difference<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:36.959> makes<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.290> video<00:02:37.410> darker

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
difference it just makes a video darker

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.490 
difference it just makes a video darker
and<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.069> doesn't<00:02:38.280> look<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:38.489> good<00:02:38.520> then<00:02:38.819> and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.520 
it's not an expensive camera but it's
it's<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:18.280> about<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.550> metal<00:03:18.820> camera<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's a it's about a metal camera and it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.990 
it's a it's about a metal camera and it
does<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.800> great<00:03:21.010> job<00:03:21.130> I'd<00:03:21.550> probably<00:03:21.760> recommend

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
does a great job I'd probably recommend

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.390 
does a great job I'd probably recommend
if<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.830> cheapest<00:03:24.220> way<00:03:24.370> to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
if you this is like the cheapest way to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.890 
if you this is like the cheapest way to
record<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> video<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.390> still<00:03:25.570> sounds

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
record a video and it still sounds

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.780 
record a video and it still sounds
pretty<00:03:25.960> decent<00:03:26.530> as<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:27.160> can<00:03:27.280> tell<00:03:27.460> from<00:03:27.490> most

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
pretty decent as you can tell from most

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.860 
pretty decent as you can tell from most
of<00:03:27.910> my<00:03:27.970> videos<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:30.000> basically<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.570> set<00:03:31.780> it

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
of my videos and basically just set it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.030 
of my videos and basically just set it
up<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.140> right<00:03:32.170> position<00:03:32.620> much<00:03:32.770> I'll<00:03:32.920> go

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
up in the right position much I'll go

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.070 
up in the right position much I'll go
over<00:03:33.130> later<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.640> video<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.960> will

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
over later in the video and it will

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.900 
over later in the video and it will
record<00:03:35.350> everything<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:36.070> totally<00:03:36.670> recommend

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
record everything I totally recommend

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.520 
record everything I totally recommend
getting<00:03:37.180> one<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.390> these<00:03:37.510> cheap<00:03:37.990> alternative

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
getting one of these cheap alternative

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.420 
getting one of these cheap alternative
and<00:03:39.810> yeah<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.590> how<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:41.770> record<00:03:42.040> my

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
and yeah so this is how I record my

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.350 
and yeah so this is how I record my
sound<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.150> everything<00:03:43.330> on<00:03:43.570> my<00:03:43.660> videos

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.680 

okay<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.620> step<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.610> part<00:03:51.240> one<00:03:51.420> right

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
okay so here is a step to part one right

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.060 
okay so here is a step to part one right
here<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.110> guess<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.590> only<00:03:52.650> part<00:03:53.010> in

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
here or I guess it's the only part in

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.310 
here or I guess it's the only part in
step<00:03:53.280> two<00:03:53.460> really<00:03:53.760> which<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.080> actually

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
step two really which is how I actually

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.200 
step two really which is how I actually
record<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.920> video<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.460> as<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.670> can<00:03:56.790> see<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
record the video so as you can see I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.480 
record the video so as you can see I
have<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:58.110> tripod<00:03:58.530> set<00:03:58.770> up<00:03:58.890> right<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.100> which<00:03:59.370> I

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
have my tripod set up right here which I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.300 
have my tripod set up right here which I
put<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.850> camera<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.600> then<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.770> have<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.100> set

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
put the camera on and then I have it set

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.030 
put the camera on and then I have it set
up<00:04:02.430> here<00:04:02.610> I'll<00:04:02.940> put<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.300> top<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.740> pretty

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
up here I'll put it on top in a pretty

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.560 
up here I'll put it on top in a pretty
good<00:04:05.220> position<00:04:05.310> where<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.120> see<00:04:06.360> all<00:04:06.540> my

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
good position where I can see all my

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.610 
good position where I can see all my
drums<00:04:07.020> all<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.440> cymbals<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.810> there's<00:04:09.810> no<00:04:10.020> when

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
drums all my cymbals and there's no when

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.930 
drums all my cymbals and there's no when
I<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.830> my<00:04:10.920> videos<00:04:11.190> there's<00:04:11.370> no<00:04:11.460> white<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.760> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
I have my videos there's no white in the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.100 
I have my videos there's no white in the
background<00:04:12.090> or<00:04:12.420> anything<00:04:12.600> don't<00:04:12.960> have<00:04:13.080> a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
background or anything don't have a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.540 
background or anything don't have a
music<00:04:13.350> stand<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> good<00:04:14.460> position

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
music stand so it's in a good position

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.850 
music stand so it's in a good position
and<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.660> want<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.870> make<00:04:15.990> sure<00:04:16.020> it's<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> it's

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
and you want to make sure it's in a it's

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.740 
and you want to make sure it's in a it's
in<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.460> close<00:04:17.670> proximity<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.510> drum<00:04:18.720> set

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
in a close proximity to the drum set

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.229 
in a close proximity to the drum set
because<00:04:19.110> if<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.500> not<00:04:19.650> if<00:04:19.860> it's<00:04:19.950> like<00:04:20.220> all<00:04:20.730> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
because if it's not if it's like all the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.990 
because if it's not if it's like all the
way<00:04:21.270> back<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:21.930> something<00:04:22.500> then<00:04:22.890> you're<00:04:23.880> not

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
way back here something then you're not

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.580 
way back here something then you're not
going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.240> get<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.450> good<00:04:24.480> as<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.170> good<00:04:25.320> sound

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
going to get as good as a good sound

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.810 
going to get as good as a good sound
quality<00:04:25.650> because<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.250> far<00:04:26.460> away<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.730> it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
quality because it's far away and it's

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.250 
quality because it's far away and it's
getting<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.090> room<00:04:27.300> sound<00:04:27.600> not<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.870> actual

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
getting the room sound not the actual

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.990 
getting the room sound not the actual
sound<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.590> drum<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.100> basically<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
sound of the drum so basically the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.520 
sound of the drum so basically the
closer<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.390> set<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.020> drums<00:04:31.260> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
closer you set it up to the drums the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.570 
closer you set it up to the drums the
more<00:04:31.680> it's<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.980> sound<00:04:32.130> like<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.490> you

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
more it's going to sound like if you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.970 
more it's going to sound like if you
actually<00:04:32.730> have<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> drum<00:04:33.330> set<00:04:33.540> miked<00:04:33.780> up<00:04:33.980> so

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
actually have the drum set miked up so

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.650 
actually have the drum set miked up so
that's<00:04:35.340> how<00:04:35.580> that's<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.970> position<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.420> used<00:04:36.570> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
that's how that's the position I used to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.140 
that's how that's the position I used to
record<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.020> camera<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.550> mean<00:04:38.700> record<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
record the camera and I mean record the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.710 
record the camera and I mean record the
drums<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:41.730> works<00:04:41.970> out<00:04:42.150> works<00:04:42.540> out<00:04:42.660> pretty

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
drums and it works out works out pretty

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.640 
drums and it works out works out pretty
well<00:04:42.870> for<00:04:42.990> me<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.170> I<00:04:43.320> definitely<00:04:43.440> recommend

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
well for me so I definitely recommend

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.230 
well for me so I definitely recommend
doing<00:04:44.040> this<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.430> you're<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> budget<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.180> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
doing this if you're on a budget and you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.360 
doing this if you're on a budget and you
don't<00:04:45.420> want<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.600> spend<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:46.340> thousand<00:04:47.340> dollars

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
don't want to spend a thousand dollars

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.530 
don't want to spend a thousand dollars
or<00:04:47.700> whatever<00:04:47.880> on<00:04:48.150> mic<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.750> equipment
