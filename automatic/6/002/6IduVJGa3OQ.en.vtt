00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.529
 This is the first class of the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.099
 mathematical modeling of the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 synthetic biology of usp part a 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.040
 mathematical concepts 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.040
 In this video we'll talk about derivatives 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.410
 to study nature we make measurements 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.720
 which result in numbers 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.990
 these numbers in turn represent 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.570
 with a certain system at some point in the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.140
 time and space 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.220
 good idea describing how these 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.680
 numbers vary in their rate of change 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.080
 let's think of a population of cells 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.040
 as time passes these cells become 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.449
 divide by generating two 48 cells 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.500
 there comes a time when we start 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.500
 lose numbers 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.870
 for this is much more interesting 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.780
 build a graph here in case 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 describing how the population increases 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.590
 of cells and pom would be to have a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 function that represents the size of this 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.750
 population 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.670
 you there because of m but here comes the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:20.650
 asks quickly to increase this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.470
 number of cells or better saying which 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.759
 is the speed of this with the speed 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 population growth 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.210
 by speed 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:44.240
 has just the vehicle's delta on 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:50.120
 lÃ©o knocking or maybe in this case here 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.850
 delta n on it being nd has to 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.670
 have a number of time the cell you 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.430
 pm about it has so is how much it changes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 this number between two stands between the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:08.000
 T is more than T 1 which is the following is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.180
 while genes that had to have 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.450
 turkey but delta t - how old are you? 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.100
 of t bond n is the number of cells this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.270
 divided by the duration of that interval 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.240
 delta t 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.230
 this is the rate of change of n we 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.700
 call beauty this is our definition if 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 he is constant 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.900
 good if it 's constant 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.360
 any constant that rate of 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.430
 variation will be zero because on is a 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.230
 Time is over, she's got time for you. 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 will have the same value 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:55.600
 then beauty equals zero 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.600
 good if n is growing 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.380
 when it is growing 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.550
 the enemy has more back you will be bigger 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.470
 that ndt then b can be positive with 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.920
 growth rate the rate of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.400
 positive variation 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.330
 analogously when n is decreasing 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 he has more delta you will be less than 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.680
 the bnd t 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.650
 therefore you will be less 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.130
 ok but what is the best delta value 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.980
 shuffle 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.050
 The smaller he is the better he 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.890
 represents a rate of change in that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.600
 time 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:42.470
 let's take the example is there is ndt 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.200
 equal to a square 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 we want to know the rate of change 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 dell has on delta t 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:04:02.690
 when it came to the one that when you good 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.269
 Okay now, look hungry. 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.110
 we are decreasing the delta value 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.390
 have the value of delta island over the delta 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:18.290
 the rate of change it will become 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:23.770
 approaching two up to half her 2012.1 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:26.150
 0 0 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 200 00 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.970
 as the delta has been getting 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.000
 the rate of change will 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.790
 approaching 2 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.120
 but what if I had another value or 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:42.650
 I do not know 234 repeating the bills by doing the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
 delta i arrived small 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.470
 we will come to the conclusion that the 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.160
 t variation or rather the rate 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.880
 variation of the delta square 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.800
 on delta te when m is having charged 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.800
 rate of change will be 2 t 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.050
 when it has a the rate of change will be 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.919
 2 when coaches rate of change 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.020
 it will be 4 364 8 when tt 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.650
 our rate of change if you repeat 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.500
 The bills always making me small. 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.000
 shrinking the rate of change have 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.250
 square goes to 2t beauty when delta 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.280
 It's very small, are you talking about the rate? 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.080
 change rate at that time is a 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.060
 of instantaneous variation 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.419
 Good , we calculate our first 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:40.960
 snowfall to derive them or rate of change 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:48.620
 can be described as 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:50.510
 mdt the mnd had so that it does not 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.450
 refers to no particular body 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.080
 it is only the rate of change of a 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.580
 he function of a variable here is you 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.569
 but could be 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.069
 izzy any letter and the derivative of the yen 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.780
 also a function 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:11.090
 we could call her to see what a 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.729
 another function and if it also has a function 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.449
 it can also be derived good 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.240
 derived from seeing it's duty of t 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.169
 the old man of tea is also another 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.080
 Function 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:29.509
 this derivative of the derivative you can 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.139
 say that the second derivative of us 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.030
 writes so with two lines 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.780
 stay connected in the next classes on 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.780
 derived
