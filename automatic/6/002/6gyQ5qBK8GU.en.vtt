00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.570 

hello<00:00:01.140> its<00:00:01.319> me<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.770> thought<00:00:02.010> I'd<00:00:02.190> bring<00:00:02.340> out

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hello its me and I thought I'd bring out

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello its me and I thought I'd bring out
this<00:00:02.909> four<00:00:03.480> layer<00:00:03.870> bump<00:00:04.290> cube<00:00:04.620> or<00:00:04.920> 4x4<00:00:05.339> mirror

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
this four layer bump cube or 4x4 mirror

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.179 
this four layer bump cube or 4x4 mirror
cube<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.390> go<00:00:06.990> through<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.620> couple<00:00:08.010> of

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
cube and go through a couple of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.879 
cube and go through a couple of
different<00:00:08.730> types<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.650> demonstration<00:00:10.650> cells

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
different types of demonstration cells

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.280 
different types of demonstration cells
with<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.450> like<00:00:12.599> four<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:12.990> fours

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
with this so I really like four by fours

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.560 
with this so I really like four by fours
because<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> simplest<00:00:14.820> version<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
because it's the simplest version of a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
because it's the simplest version of a
puzzle<00:00:15.780> where<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.320> explore<00:00:16.680> aspects<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
puzzle where you can explore aspects of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.080 
puzzle where you can explore aspects of
parity<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.449> other<00:00:18.630> fascinating

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
parity and other fascinating

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
parity and other fascinating
complications<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.300> solve<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> really

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
complications to solve and what I really

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
complications to solve and what I really
like<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.130> mir<00:00:23.369> cubes<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:25.880> well

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
like about the mir cubes is that well

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
like about the mir cubes is that well
ideally<00:00:27.510> every<00:00:27.869> piece<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.650> supposed<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.949> be

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
ideally every piece is supposed to be

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.380 
ideally every piece is supposed to be
different<00:00:29.250> although<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
different although you can see the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
different although you can see the
center<00:00:30.660> pieces<00:00:30.900> are<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.529> same<00:00:32.030> these<00:00:33.030> edges

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
center pieces are the same these edges

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
center pieces are the same these edges
are<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> same<00:00:33.809> -<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.829> exactly<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
are the same - but not exactly the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
are the same - but not exactly the
variations<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
variations that you can get with this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
variations that you can get with this
and<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.190> complications<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and the complications with this is this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
and the complications with this is this
actually<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> super<00:00:41.040> cube<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> were<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
actually a super cube and if you were to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually a super cube and if you were to
get<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> puzzle<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> recommend

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
get a puzzle like this what I recommend

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
get a puzzle like this what I recommend
is<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
is you get it with these kind of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
is you get it with these kind of
stickers<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> silver<00:00:46.530> stickers<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.430> might

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
stickers the silver stickers you might

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.979 
stickers the silver stickers you might
not<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.760> able<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.120> too<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.600> camera

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
not be able to see too much on camera

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
not be able to see too much on camera
but<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.530> stickers<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.039> certain<00:00:50.370> graining

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
but the stickers have certain graining

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
but the stickers have certain graining
to<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.899> goes<00:00:53.629> horizontally<00:00:54.629> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to them so this goes horizontally this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.889 
to them so this goes horizontally this
one<00:00:55.440> goes<00:00:55.590> horizontally<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.180> here

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
one goes horizontally and this one here

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
one goes horizontally and this one here
goes<00:00:58.039> vertically<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.550> because<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
goes vertically so because of that you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
goes vertically so because of that you
can<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> situation<00:01:01.890> where<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.670> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can actually have a situation where if I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
can actually have a situation where if I
were<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> swap<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:03.539> centers<00:01:04.140> they're

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
were to swap these two centers they're

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
were to swap these two centers they're
not<00:01:04.710> exactly<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> same<00:01:05.640> they're<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:05.939> exactly

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
not exactly the same they're not exactly

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 
not exactly the same they're not exactly
the<00:01:06.510> same<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.000> grain<00:01:09.270> here

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the same because then the the grain here

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.160 
the same because then the the grain here
is<00:01:09.659> gonna<00:01:09.780> go<00:01:10.049> against<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> will<00:01:11.580> be

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
is gonna go against here so this will be

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
is gonna go against here so this will be
horizontal<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.710> vertical<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
horizontal and this will be vertical so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
horizontal and this will be vertical so
as<00:01:15.210> such<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> something<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
as such this actually is something of a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
as such this actually is something of a
super-cute<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.119> causes<00:01:18.360> some

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
super-cute and it causes some

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
super-cute and it causes some
interesting<00:01:19.380> kinds<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> complications<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
interesting kinds of complications that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
interesting kinds of complications that
can<00:01:21.000> happen<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.080> you're<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.290> sure

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
can happen with that if you're not sure

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.670 
can happen with that if you're not sure
how<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.979> deal<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.470> possible

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
how to deal with this so it's possible

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
how to deal with this so it's possible
to<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> completely

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to have it what you think is completely

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
to have it what you think is completely
solved<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> find<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
solved but then you find that but the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
solved but then you find that but the
center's<00:01:30.030> rotated<00:01:30.450> off<00:01:30.600> by<00:01:30.750> 90<00:01:31.020> degrees<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.680> if

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
center's rotated off by 90 degrees so if

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
center's rotated off by 90 degrees so if
that's<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> case<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:34.020> mind<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's the case then in my mind you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
that's the case then in my mind you
haven't<00:01:34.829> completely<00:01:35.159> solved<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.420> how

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
haven't completely solved it so how

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
haven't completely solved it so how
should<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.259> scramble<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.250> there's<00:01:38.460> only

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
should I scramble it well there's only

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.410 
should I scramble it well there's only
one<00:01:38.640> mode<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> scramble

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
one mode to scramble

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
one mode to scramble
how<00:01:39.659> should<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.930> solve<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.350> puzzle<00:01:40.560> well

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
how should I solve this puzzle well

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
how should I solve this puzzle well
there's<00:01:41.549> three<00:01:42.060> ways<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.630> solving<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.110> 4x4<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
there's three ways of solving a 4x4 you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
there's three ways of solving a 4x4 you
can<00:01:44.250> solve<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.579> by<00:01:44.759> reduction<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.600> means

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
can solve it by reduction which means

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
can solve it by reduction which means
you<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.530> scrambled<00:01:47.189> 4x4<00:01:47.759> reduce<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you take a scrambled 4x4 reduce it to a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
you take a scrambled 4x4 reduce it to a
3x3<00:01:49.200> by<00:01:49.350> placing<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> center's<00:01:50.310> Center

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
3x3 by placing the center's Center

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
3x3 by placing the center's Center
center<00:01:51.240> Center<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.869> center<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> reduce

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
center Center and center then you reduce

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.740 
center Center and center then you reduce
the<00:01:53.490> edges<00:01:53.790> down<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> solve<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the edges down and you solve a like a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
the edges down and you solve a like a
3x3<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.430> way<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.610> doing<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.000> that's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
3x3 so that's one way of doing it that's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.520 
3x3 so that's one way of doing it that's
the<00:01:57.270> classic<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.899> doing<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.380> all

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the classic way of doing it that's all

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
the classic way of doing it that's all
most<00:01:58.680> people<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.880> run<00:02:00.030> into

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
most people do it you can run into

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.639 
most people do it you can run into
things<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.540> parity<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.560> how

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
things like parity but if you know how

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.139 
things like parity but if you know how
to<00:02:01.740> deal<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:01.950> parity<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.090> way

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to deal with parity you can get your way

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.060 
to deal with parity you can get your way
through<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> doing<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
through it the other way of doing it is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.980 
through it the other way of doing it is
layer<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.520> layer<00:02:05.549> where<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> first

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
layer by layer where you do the first

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
layer by layer where you do the first
layer<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> second<00:02:08.039> layer<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
layer then the second layer then the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
layer then the second layer then the
third<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> fourth<00:02:09.330> another<00:02:10.110> fun<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
third and the fourth another fun way of

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.400 
third and the fourth another fun way of
solving<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.750> really<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.200> matter<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
solving it it's really just a matter of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.780 
solving it it's really just a matter of
place

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
place

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.910 
place
things<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.659> kind<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.170> minimization<00:02:15.590> of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
things it's kind of a minimization of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.740 
things it's kind of a minimization of
algorithms<00:02:16.459> with<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.819> once<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.659> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
algorithms with that once you get to the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.449 
algorithms with that once you get to the
final<00:02:18.049> layer<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.469> can<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:18.799> into<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.129> certain

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
final layer you can get into a certain

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.160 
final layer you can get into a certain
type<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:20.000> parity<00:02:20.359> that<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.540> call<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.810> floppy

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
type of a parity that I call the floppy

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.110 
type of a parity that I call the floppy
parity<00:02:21.620> which<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:21.950> really<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.670> same<00:02:22.879> kind<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
parity which is really the same kind of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.670 
parity which is really the same kind of
thing<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.329> you<00:02:23.540> find<00:02:23.689> with<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.930> floppy<00:02:24.200> puzzle

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
thing that you find with a floppy puzzle

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.699 
thing that you find with a floppy puzzle
so<00:02:25.549> we<00:02:26.000> could<00:02:26.150> do<00:02:26.239> layer<00:02:26.420> by<00:02:26.599> layer<00:02:26.629> or<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
so we could do layer by layer or if you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.780 
so we could do layer by layer or if you
want<00:02:27.829> to<00:02:27.890> dispense<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.400> parity<00:02:28.700> all

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
want to dispense with parity all

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.399 
want to dispense with parity all
together<00:02:28.939> you<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.989> call<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
together you can do what I call the

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.979 
together you can do what I call the
parity<00:02:30.769> free<00:02:31.069> type<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.909> solve<00:02:32.180> now<00:02:32.720> I've<00:02:32.840> had

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
parity free type of solve now I've had

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.569 
parity free type of solve now I've had
demonstrations<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.769> all<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.159> those<00:02:34.280> but

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
demonstrations of all of those but

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.640 
demonstrations of all of those but
basically<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> parity<00:02:35.480> free<00:02:35.870> solve<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.379> is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
basically what a parity free solve is is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.520 
basically what a parity free solve is is
you<00:02:36.769> put<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.819> two<00:02:38.060> by<00:02:38.209> two<00:02:38.239> blocks<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:39.079> each

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you put in the two by two blocks on each

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
you put in the two by two blocks on each
side<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.970> basically<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.540> by<00:02:41.629> doing<00:02:41.780> a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
side and I basically do that by doing a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.449 
side and I basically do that by doing a
layer<00:02:42.109> by<00:02:42.290> layer<00:02:42.319> by<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.739> first<00:02:43.040> two<00:02:43.159> layers

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
layer by layer by the first two layers

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.399 
layer by layer by the first two layers
this<00:02:43.670> one<00:02:43.849> on<00:02:43.939> this<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.450> then<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.049> finish

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
this one on this one and then I finish

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.039 
this one on this one and then I finish
up<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:46.069> last<00:02:46.519> two<00:02:46.879> layers<00:02:47.120> here<00:02:47.510> with<00:02:47.720> an<00:02:47.840> AI

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
up the last two layers here with an AI

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.979 
up the last two layers here with an AI
salt<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.340> any<00:02:49.760> one<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.209> them<00:02:50.450> are<00:02:50.659> fun

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
salt so any one of them are fun

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.920 
salt so any one of them are fun
variations<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.829> fun<00:02:52.040> salts<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:53.359> shall<00:02:53.810> I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930

variations and fun salts so how shall I
do<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.349> one<00:02:54.620> how<00:02:54.980> would<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.459> see

this would you like to see a reduction

this would you like to see a reduction
