00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
there you go why I'm going to do a b8

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.899 
there you go why I'm going to do a b8
auto<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.060> well<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:01.200> each<00:02:01.409> each<00:02:01.710> auto<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
auto as well because each each auto is a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
auto as well because each each auto is a
little<00:02:03.180> different<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.810> v8<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> little

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
little different so the v8 is a little

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.790 
little different so the v8 is a little
harder<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.789> has

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
harder and it also has

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.420 
harder and it also has
let's<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:10.820> your<00:02:10.940> may<00:02:11.090> use<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.330> same<00:02:11.510> team<00:02:12.430> ba

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
let's see your may use the same team ba

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.540 
let's see your may use the same team ba
I<00:02:13.910> believe<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:15.260> boss<00:02:15.440> gets<00:02:15.710> immunity<00:02:16.010> buff

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
I believe the boss gets immunity buff

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.370 
I believe the boss gets immunity buff
while<00:02:17.030> will<00:02:17.210> do<00:02:17.360> will<00:02:17.600> do<00:02:17.720> run<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.230> what

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
while will do will do run and see what

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.650 
while will do will do run and see what
happens

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.920 

so<00:02:26.320> let's<00:02:26.860> see<00:02:27.100> here<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.240> pretty<00:02:28.480> pretty

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
so let's see here so pretty pretty

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.720 
so let's see here so pretty pretty
standard<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.160> first<00:02:30.400> two<00:02:30.520> stages

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
standard like the the first two stages

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.450 
standard like the the first two stages
all<00:02:31.120> about<00:02:31.390> quickly<00:02:31.990> bursting<00:02:32.380> down<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
all about quickly bursting down the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.630 
all about quickly bursting down the
crystals<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.300> golem<00:02:35.400> particular<00:02:36.400> that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
crystals and the golem particular that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.060 
crystals and the golem particular that
the<00:02:36.790> crystals<00:02:37.180> first<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.720> Auto<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.920> don't

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
the crystals first in Auto you you don't

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.600 
the crystals first in Auto you you don't
really<00:02:39.220> get<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.490> choose<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:41.460> somebody<00:02:42.460> might

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
really get to choose so somebody might

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.050 
really get to choose so somebody might
die<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:43.270> Shen<00:02:43.840> doesn't<00:02:44.200> oh<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:45.460> got<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> lucky

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
die if Shen doesn't oh I got a lucky

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.010 
die if Shen doesn't oh I got a lucky
stun<00:02:46.390> there<00:02:47.100> otherwise<00:02:48.100> my<00:02:48.660> my<00:02:49.660> Lucian

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
stun there otherwise my my Lucian

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.660 
stun there otherwise my my Lucian
probably<00:02:50.320> would<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.470> died<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.950> apparently

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
probably would have died so apparently

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.650 
probably would have died so apparently
be<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> lot<00:02:55.330> harder<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:58.450> hundred

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
be a it's a lot harder and one hundred

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.780 
be a it's a lot harder and one hundred
percent<00:02:58.690> auto<00:02:58.990> for<00:02:59.230> me<00:02:59.350> my<00:02:59.620> I<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.640> switch

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
percent auto for me my I have to switch

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.230 
percent auto for me my I have to switch
on<00:03:00.940> my<00:03:01.060> team<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.480> see<00:03:01.690> what's<00:03:02.590> better<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:04.120> this

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
on my team to see what's better but this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.910 
on my team to see what's better but this
team<00:03:04.480> seems<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> work<00:03:04.960> fine<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.380> long<00:03:05.410> as<00:03:05.740> they

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
team seems to work fine as long as they

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.210 
team seems to work fine as long as they
can<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.640> boss<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.860> let's<00:03:08.860> see<00:03:09.070> what

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
can get to the boss and let's see what

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.420 
can get to the boss and let's see what
okay<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.790> boss<00:03:09.970> has<00:03:10.890> weakened<00:03:11.890> attack

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
okay the boss has weakened attack

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.190 
okay the boss has weakened attack
crystal<00:03:12.880> okay<00:03:13.210> so<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:15.390> he<00:03:16.390> has<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> salt

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
crystal okay so and he has a salt

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.430 
crystal okay so and he has a salt
crystal<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.250> actually<00:03:18.820> be<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.690> not<00:03:19.960> as<00:03:20.200> bad

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
crystal so actually be a is not as bad

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.000 
crystal so actually be a is not as bad
as<00:03:20.710> long<00:03:20.860> as<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.160> survive<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:23.010> onslaught

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
as long as you can survive the onslaught

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.220 
as long as you can survive the onslaught
for<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.520> first<00:03:24.760> two<00:03:24.940> turns<00:03:25.180> by<00:03:25.840> having<00:03:26.170> a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
for in the first two turns by having a

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.110 
for in the first two turns by having a
buffer<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.770> perhaps<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> have<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.700> crisis

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
buffer and perhaps if you have a crisis

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.490 
buffer and perhaps if you have a crisis
then<00:03:28.330> it'd<00:03:28.510> be<00:03:28.660> even<00:03:28.750> better<00:03:28.900> because<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
then it'd be even better because you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.430 
then it'd be even better because you
have<00:03:29.620> shields<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.140> somebody<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.290> can

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
have shields and somebody that can

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.500 
have shields and somebody that can
cleanse<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:33.070> defense<00:03:33.430> debuff<00:03:33.790> such<00:03:34.060> as<00:03:34.240> kana

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
cleanse the defense debuff such as kana

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.270 
cleanse the defense debuff such as kana
Mia<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.930> actually<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:35.920> useful<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:36.550> well<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
Mia is actually really useful as well so

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.800 
Mia is actually really useful as well so
bb7<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.490> it's<00:03:39.760> pretty<00:03:40.060> simple<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.050> far<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
bb7 be a it's pretty simple so far and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.120 
bb7 be a it's pretty simple so far and
obviously<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:44.140> everybody<00:03:44.320> has<00:03:44.530> Aleutian<00:03:44.920> so

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
obviously not everybody has Aleutian so

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.470 
obviously not everybody has Aleutian so
you<00:03:45.190> can<00:03:45.459> always<00:03:45.640> substitution<00:03:46.270> for

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
you can always substitution for

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.470 
you can always substitution for
something<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.140> rack<00:03:47.920> if<00:03:48.430> you're<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
something like a rack if you're like a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.330 
something like a rack if you're like a
new<00:03:49.660> player<00:03:49.930> which<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> fire<00:03:50.560> inugami<00:03:50.980> or

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
new player which is the fire inugami or

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.390 
new player which is the fire inugami or
you<00:03:52.330> could<00:03:52.570> go<00:03:52.750> with<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.560> dot<00:03:53.830> you<00:03:54.040> nogami

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you could go with the dot you nogami

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.160 
you could go with the dot you nogami
which<00:03:54.580> is<00:03:54.700> crow<00:03:54.970> which<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.720> can<00:03:55.840> get<00:03:55.930> from<00:03:55.989> a

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
which is crow which you can get from a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.660 
which is crow which you can get from a
secret<00:03:56.350> dungeon<00:03:56.620> he's<00:03:57.010> pretty<00:03:57.370> good<00:03:57.550> as<00:03:57.640> well

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
secret dungeon he's pretty good as well

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.660 
secret dungeon he's pretty good as well
because<00:03:58.090> he<00:03:58.150> offers<00:03:58.480> defense<00:03:58.930> debuff<00:03:59.350> and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
because he offers defense debuff and

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.630 
because he offers defense debuff and
also<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.330> continuous<00:04:02.230> damage<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.400> he<00:04:03.489> does

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
also the continuous damage but he does

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.460 
also the continuous damage but he does
have<00:04:03.820> low<00:04:03.970> HP<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.630> have<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.989> invest<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.410> a

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
have low HP so you have to invest in a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.060 
have low HP so you have to invest in a
little<00:04:05.830> bit<00:04:05.920> more<00:04:06.360> but<00:04:07.360> three<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.650> be<00:04:08.800> pretty

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
little bit more but three to be pretty

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.860 
little bit more but three to be pretty
honest<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:09.820> need<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.000> good<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.660> good
