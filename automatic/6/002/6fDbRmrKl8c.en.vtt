00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
so Dante as well as having his human

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.610 
so Dante as well as having his human
form<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:34.970> his<00:01:35.030> gunplay<00:01:35.690> and<00:01:35.930> swordplay<00:01:36.350> with

form with his gunplay and swordplay with

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.060 
form with his gunplay and swordplay with
the<00:01:36.710> rebellion<00:01:37.190> he's<00:01:37.700> also<00:01:37.910> got<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.870> demon<00:01:39.650> form

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the rebellion he's also got a demon form

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.580 
the rebellion he's also got a demon form
in<00:01:40.730> which<00:01:40.940> he<00:01:41.150> can<00:01:41.360> pull<00:01:41.930> out<00:01:42.050> different<00:01:42.260> types

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
in which he can pull out different types

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.920 
in which he can pull out different types
of<00:01:42.830> weapons<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.550> an<00:01:43.640> angel<00:01:43.970> form<00:01:44.240> which<00:01:44.840> he

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
of weapons and an angel form which he

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.170 
of weapons and an angel form which he
can<00:01:45.080> do<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.260> same<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.920> you've<00:01:46.580> got<00:01:46.730> three<00:01:46.970> sets

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
can do the same so you've got three sets

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.330 
can do the same so you've got three sets
of<00:01:47.330> weapons<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.050> within<00:01:48.290> each<00:01:48.500> set<00:01:48.770> there<00:01:49.310> are

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
of weapons and within each set there are

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
of weapons and within each set there are
multiple<00:01:49.970> versions<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.690> weapons<00:01:51.050> as<00:01:51.200> well<00:01:51.410> so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
multiple versions of weapons as well so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.850 
multiple versions of weapons as well so
the<00:01:52.220> idea<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.930> broaden<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.440> amount<00:01:54.680> of

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the idea is to broaden the amount of

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.380 
the idea is to broaden the amount of
weapons<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.430> allow<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.820> switch<00:01:56.060> between

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
weapons and allow you to switch between

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.200 
weapons and allow you to switch between
them<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.900> fly<00:01:57.520> with<00:01:58.520> angel<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.090> demon

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
them on the fly with angel and demon

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.390 
them on the fly with angel and demon
you're<00:01:59.630> also<00:01:59.780> able<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.410> have<00:02:00.560> other<00:02:00.830> abilities

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
you're also able to have other abilities

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.720 
you're also able to have other abilities
like<00:02:01.700> gliding<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.840> or<00:02:03.500> flat<00:02:03.800> board<00:02:04.070> chaining

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
like gliding or or flat board chaining

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.230 
like gliding or or flat board chaining
enemies<00:02:05.180> together<00:02:05.390> flying<00:02:06.229> towards<00:02:06.650> them<00:02:07.240> but

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
enemies together flying towards them but

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.600 
enemies together flying towards them but
with<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.510> you<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.780> also<00:02:08.920> manipulate<00:02:09.920> parts<00:02:10.520> of

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
with it you can also manipulate parts of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.280 
with it you can also manipulate parts of
the<00:02:10.729> environment<00:02:10.940> ripping<00:02:11.600> out<00:02:11.720> parts<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the environment ripping out parts of the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.330 
the environment ripping out parts of the
environment<00:02:13.239> traversing<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.450> we're<00:02:14.600> adding

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
environment traversing so we're adding

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.790 
environment traversing so we're adding
some<00:02:16.540> kind<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.570> dynamics<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.170> outside<00:02:18.680> of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
some kind of dynamics that outside of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.120 
some kind of dynamics that outside of
combat<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.520> series<00:02:20.230> yeah<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.739> demons

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
combat to the series yeah so the demons

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010 
combat to the series yeah so the demons
exist<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.790> parallel<00:02:23.300> well<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.870> very

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
exist in this parallel well it's a very

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.440 
exist in this parallel well it's a very
malignant<00:02:24.530> world<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.880> reflection<00:02:26.090> of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
malignant world and it's a reflection of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.900 
malignant world and it's a reflection of
our<00:02:26.600> world<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.140> we're<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:28.010> aware<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.430> how

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
our world and we're not aware of how

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.020 
our world and we're not aware of how
they're<00:02:29.120> manipulating<00:02:29.330> us

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
they're manipulating us

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
they're manipulating us
dancer<00:02:32.030> being<00:02:32.390> having<00:02:32.780> demonic<00:02:33.290> blood<00:02:33.470> is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
dancer being having demonic blood is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.760 
dancer being having demonic blood is
able<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.940> traverse<00:02:35.150> into<00:02:35.930> these<00:02:36.080> worlds<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
able to traverse into these worlds and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.800 
able to traverse into these worlds and
see<00:02:37.070> see<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.880> world<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.209> what<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.540> from

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
see see the world for what it is from

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.320 
see see the world for what it is from
the<00:02:38.900> demonic<00:02:39.140> perspective<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.880> sense<00:02:41.120> he

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
the demonic perspective so in a sense he

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.030 
the demonic perspective so in a sense he
can<00:02:41.480> see<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.780> truth<00:02:42.020> behind<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.530> illusion<00:02:42.650> we

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
can see the truth behind the illusion we

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.760 
can see the truth behind the illusion we
all<00:02:43.190> live<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> he's<00:02:44.959> got<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.320> power<00:02:45.500> to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
all live in and so he's got the power to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.090 
all live in and so he's got the power to
fight<00:02:45.980> back<00:02:46.250> against<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.090> forces<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> are

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
fight back against the forces that are

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.009 
fight back against the forces that are
manipulating<00:02:49.100> us<00:02:49.220> without<00:02:49.970> going<00:02:50.570> too<00:02:50.810> much

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
manipulating us without going too much

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.770 
manipulating us without going too much
into<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.470> story<00:02:51.709> at<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.040> stage<00:02:52.780> Dante's
