00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
these things and number one it's make

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
these things and number one it's make
sure<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.960> cadence<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:32.939> spot

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
sure your cadence is at the right spot

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.319 
sure your cadence is at the right spot
now<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.049> cadence<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.799> your<00:01:35.369> step<00:01:35.729> rate<00:01:36.000> or

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
now your cadence is your step rate or

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
now your cadence is your step rate or
how<00:01:36.360> many<00:01:36.689> steps<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> you're<00:01:37.380> taking<00:01:37.409> per

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
how many steps that you're taking per

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660 
how many steps that you're taking per
minute<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> gonna<00:01:40.650> change<00:01:41.040> based<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
minute now this is gonna change based on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
minute now this is gonna change based on
how<00:01:41.939> fast<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
how fast you're going what kind of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
how fast you're going what kind of
terrain<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.610> running<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> few

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
terrain your your running on and a few

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
terrain your your running on and a few
other<00:01:46.500> factors<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.549> you're<00:01:47.850> under<00:01:48.090> 170

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
other factors but if you're under 170

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
other factors but if you're under 170
steps<00:01:49.500> per<00:01:49.860> minute<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.180> lot<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> room

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
steps per minute there's a lot of room

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410 
steps per minute there's a lot of room
for<00:01:52.020> improvement<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> while<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.390> on

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
for improvement so while you're out on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.179 
for improvement so while you're out on
an<00:01:54.630> easy<00:01:54.780> run<00:01:55.079> count<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> number<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.890> steps

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
an easy run count the number of steps

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
an easy run count the number of steps
that<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.180> single<00:01:57.540> minute<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that you take in a single minute and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.010 
that you take in a single minute and
then<00:01:58.619> that's<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.700> cadence<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.719> under

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
then that's your cadence if it's under

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.160 
then that's your cadence if it's under
170<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.310> should<00:02:02.490> try<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> improve<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
170 you should try to improve that and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.649 
170 you should try to improve that and
get<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> over<00:02:04.619> 170<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> people<00:02:06.450> have

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
get it over 170 a lot of people have

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
get it over 170 a lot of people have
talked<00:02:06.869> about<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.170> 180<00:02:07.829> steps<00:02:08.129> per<00:02:08.399> minute<00:02:08.550> as

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
talked about the 180 steps per minute as

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.170 
talked about the 180 steps per minute as
the<00:02:08.959> golden<00:02:09.959> step<00:02:10.800> rate<00:02:11.099> there's<00:02:11.910> no<00:02:12.000> such

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the golden step rate there's no such

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.160 
the golden step rate there's no such
thing<00:02:12.420> as

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
thing as

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.730 
thing as
cadance<00:02:13.770> number<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.640> simply<00:02:15.000> doesn't<00:02:15.209> exist

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
cadance number it simply doesn't exist

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.280 
cadance number it simply doesn't exist
under<00:02:17.000> 170<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.510> problematic<00:02:18.959> for

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
under 170 can be problematic for

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.890 
under 170 can be problematic for
injuries<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.069> you're<00:02:20.190> over<00:02:20.550> 170<00:02:21.330> you're

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
injuries but if you're over 170 you're

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.020 
injuries but if you're over 170 you're
doing<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> lot<00:02:22.349> right<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.580> second<00:02:24.000> thing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
doing a lot right now the second thing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.850 
doing a lot right now the second thing
that<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> improve<00:02:25.080> your<00:02:25.140> form<00:02:25.590> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that you can do to improve your form is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.600 
that you can do to improve your form is
to<00:02:26.489> land<00:02:26.730> underneath<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.780> body<00:02:28.610> combined

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to land underneath your body combined

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.059 
to land underneath your body combined
with<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:30.030> faster<00:02:30.540> cadence<00:02:30.720> landing<00:02:31.560> underneath

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
with a faster cadence landing underneath

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.280 
with a faster cadence landing underneath
your<00:02:32.250> body<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.730> opposed<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.420> reaching<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:34.140> in

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
your body as opposed to reaching out in

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.000 
your body as opposed to reaching out in
front<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.620> you

front of you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.580 
front of you
and<00:02:35.670> over-striding<00:02:36.360> you're<00:02:37.020> gonna<00:02:37.140> correct

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
and over-striding you're gonna correct

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.979 
and over-striding you're gonna correct
most<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> problems<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.239> poor<00:02:39.600> running

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
most of the problems with poor running

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.120 
most of the problems with poor running
form<00:02:40.550> now<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:42.480> lot<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.500> people<00:02:43.739> pay<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> lot<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
form now a lot of people pay a lot of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.699 
form now a lot of people pay a lot of
tension<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.540> type<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> foot<00:02:46.110> strike<00:02:46.470> that

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
tension to the type of foot strike that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.380 
tension to the type of foot strike that
they<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.040> whether<00:02:47.310> their<00:02:47.610> heel<00:02:48.030> striking

forefoot striking mid-foot striking it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.300 
forefoot striking mid-foot striking it
doesn't<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.630> matter<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.440> you're<00:02:53.040> landing

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
doesn't really matter if you're landing

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
doesn't really matter if you're landing
underneath<00:02:53.819> your<00:02:54.000> body<00:02:54.150> you're<00:02:54.690> not<00:02:54.720> over

underneath your body you're not over

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
underneath your body you're not over
striding<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.069> cadence<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.730> at<00:02:57.180> least

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
striding and your cadence is at least

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.500 
striding and your cadence is at least
over<00:02:57.660> 170<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:59.340> will<00:02:59.489> get<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> lot<00:03:00.000> faster

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
over 170 and that will get a lot faster

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.900 
over 170 and that will get a lot faster
the<00:03:00.600> faster<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.080> run<00:03:01.260> you're<00:03:02.190> taking<00:03:02.489> care<00:03:02.700> of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the faster you run you're taking care of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.470 
the faster you run you're taking care of
almost<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:05.040> running<00:03:05.430> form<00:03:05.850> problems

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
almost all of the running form problems

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.070 
almost all of the running form problems
that<00:03:06.930> most<00:03:07.230> runners<00:03:07.500> tend<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.160> now

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
that most runners tend to have now

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.840 
that most runners tend to have now

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
pulled up in the air now what this is

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.560 
pulled up in the air now what this is
gonna<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.130> gonna<00:03:32.489> give<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.880> tall

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
gonna do it's gonna give you a tall

erect posture it's gonna prevent

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.479 
erect posture it's gonna prevent
slouching<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.829> gonna<00:03:37.950> prevent<00:03:38.280> that

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
slouching and it's gonna prevent that

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.180 
slouching and it's gonna prevent that
forward<00:03:39.180> lean<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.170> lot<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.650> runners<00:03:40.799> think

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
forward lean that a lot of runners think

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.940 
forward lean that a lot of runners think
they<00:03:41.340> need<00:03:41.579> but<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.540> fact<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:43.350> should<00:03:43.530> come

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
they need but in fact it should come

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.800 
they need but in fact it should come
naturally<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.730> forward<00:03:45.090> lean<00:03:45.239> should<00:03:45.600> come

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
naturally the forward lean should come

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.140 
naturally the forward lean should come
from<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> ankles<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.859> most<00:03:47.609> runners<00:03:47.820> should

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
from the ankles and most runners should

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.810 
from the ankles and most runners should
instead<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.140> focusing<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.890> focus<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.760> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
instead of focusing on that focus on a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.530 
instead of focusing on that focus on a
tall<00:03:51.180> erect<00:03:51.450> posture<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:53.489> cue<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.150> going

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
tall erect posture and that cue is going

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.740 
tall erect posture and that cue is going
to<00:03:55.040> make<00:03:56.040> sure<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.400> your<00:03:56.519> form<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.269> much<00:03:57.600> more

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
to make sure that your form is much more

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.750 
to make sure that your form is much more
efficient<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.890> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.069> prevent<00:03:59.310> bending

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
efficient it's going to prevent bending

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.949 
efficient it's going to prevent bending
at<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.880> waist<00:04:00.000> which<00:04:00.540> can<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.780> very

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
at the waist which can be very

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.680 
at the waist which can be very
problematic<00:04:01.170> for<00:04:01.590> back<00:04:01.920> injuries<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.690> it's

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
make sure that you're running really

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.529 
make sure that you're running really
fast<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:42.279> when<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.490> run<00:05:42.669> fast<00:05:42.969> you<00:05:43.270> have<00:05:43.479> a

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
fast and when you run fast you have a

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.390 
fast and when you run fast you have a
pretty<00:05:43.900> good<00:05:43.960> range<00:05:44.259> of<00:05:44.469> motion<00:05:44.620> if<00:05:44.949> you're

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
pretty good range of motion if you're

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.700 
pretty good range of motion if you're
always<00:05:45.669> running<00:05:46.060> slow<00:05:46.449> you're<00:05:47.110> never<00:05:47.349> getting

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
always running slow you're never getting

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.370 
always running slow you're never getting
that<00:05:47.740> big<00:05:48.190> wide<00:05:48.699> range<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.330> motion<00:05:49.539> in<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.199> hip

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
that big wide range of motion in the hip

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.249 
that big wide range of motion in the hip
joint<00:05:50.770> okay<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.699> so<00:05:52.090> by<00:05:52.300> running<00:05:52.479> fast<00:05:52.870> you're

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
joint okay and so by running fast you're
