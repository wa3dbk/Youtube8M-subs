00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.870
 hi i am going today my lipstick and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.970
 clean up lip gloss drawers 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 I bought new cotton wool from the ebay 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.820
 from ebay 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.070
 purchased on ebay and I want that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 filling kidney now works is just not 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 hear theo and besides that I'm just right 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 too much stuff or 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.100
 there are great lots of stuff we think 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 but I just don't use it anymore 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.210
 I'm going to rearrange all sets that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 and give away some things 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.439
 and you are a lip gloss charger is whole 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 just your trays 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.320
 out well because it's just too much it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 is really just a bit of a mess 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 to love just completely not so 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.219
 clean up to see mother and very much 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 pleasure watching 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.360
 so I'm going to start okay that's how it looks now 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.340
 from 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.570
 in this container here my containers that are small 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.129
 lipsticks 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 and these are the containers where i like that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.910
 Clear my lipstick now that we are going to do it 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.739
 This can be the idea and I have one 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 I think he wrote an article about it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 has already come online 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.719
 so when this video comes online 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 the seller and how it all worked 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 you can see the article again 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 No 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 lip glosses that come in here and that works out 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
 look fine because you can't lie 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 as in lipstick holders that matters 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.210
 not with the height of it certainly not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 original longer that just works 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 actually very nice so that's why 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 I put it all in a container 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.869
 just i just have too much this there 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.500
 you just have to get in and out 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.460
 be so look with me and i go 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
 to start 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.079
 I'm here in the stuff anyway 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 do that may go away 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.909
 and give away the stuff here 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.180
 may I first of all now 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.180
 goods 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.160
 beautiful 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.729
 ok I now have a selection 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.760
 made 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.980
 I'm going to give this whole pot away already 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 almost all colors that I just use 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.940
 dude he thinks I'm not on and where 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.160
 I kind of had enough of them too 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.700
 bit atypical there are our re-colors 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.660
 i go the web and some of those go away 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 are simply no longer good at the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.140
 tassels would not be good anymore 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.910
 better that he just put in the trash 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.569
 go what i keep about when you see here 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.890
 I think I'll go in parts per hour 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.079
 I think it's the best it is 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.970
 mainly all drugstore 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.190
 notice that there is no luxury or chanel 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.510
 he hears things inside so I think so 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.510
 I at this bakery 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.080
 No 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.600
 one could the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.930
 so this is it 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.540
 here are the tinted lip balms here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.940
 sit the lip pencil you about 80 yes that 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.470
 may well color dark in there and there 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.930
 lip balms 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.560
 Here are the raspberries 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.600
 red of angry and pink colors 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.180
 here are the red colors here 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.090
 the coral pink shades that sit the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.570
 roses that we put on the burgundy colors 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.200
 level and here are curious like 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.540
 colors 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.940
 I am afraid he really is half as much 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.730
 now that looks really super neat 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.260
 the now very happy with it 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.000
 they are going to do well in the drawer today and 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 then I switch to the lipsticks 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.160
 and 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.450
 to do 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.740
 so this is his the lipstick pack 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.720
 Here are all the catrice and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.210
 essence 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.360
 lipstick in here are all a bit more 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.509
 high and like mac and long now come solo 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.949
 and the more expensive drugstore brands and 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.539
 here is the hema and secretly 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.889
 just with you what's in it but 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.850
 this is feeling then the following 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.979
 buckler 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.110
 the can do this well in itself 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.789
 but i don't know if the key yes that 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.169
 are now so able then this just feel it 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.849
 the whole idea is a bit like you 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.680
 I keep this letter here 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.389

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.460

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.470
