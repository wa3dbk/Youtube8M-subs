00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.939
 praise the welcome to my channel I am 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.880
 elisa and I'm Dominican for which I do not 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:15.030
 you know and today I bring you your note of what 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.369
 do and what not to do with our hair 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.890
 the first thing that I would not do to my 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.250
 hair is to tell him to see it since my hair 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 it is dry and at the same time it is curly not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 could because the hair will dry out to another 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.829
 thing that I would avoid is the dryer to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.160
 high temperature since the dryer 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.680
 damage to our curls and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.100
 they lose their natural form 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.489
 I would not use it either 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.829
 Another thing that I would not do either is to nail the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.260
 hair every day with shampoo that I 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.519
 I would not do it because it's pureed dry 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.299
 Pretty hair and our afro hair 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.530
 natural needs hydration because it is 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.060
 a hair 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.280
 dry 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.470
 if we use rende to wash 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.990
 our hair volume two or three times 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 per week our hair can keep 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.780
 our natural hydration something else 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.240
 that I would not do either is to sleep with the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.110
 loose hair since that causes many 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.370
 tangles and I would not use gummies that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.680
 have this here since this can break 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.190
 our hair so we must use 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.170
 meals of this one that do not bring anything and so 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.880
 keep our hair dry 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.030
 I do not have a service 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.950
 we must use are the oils 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.500
 hot at least once for the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.930
 week these oils give you a good 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 hydration to the hair and it defines you very 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.550
 pretty the curls 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.550
 I am using these two oils 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.160
 be warm before the shampoo and from 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.550
 after the shampoo inside a 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.220
 very good hydration for our 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.920
 path 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.770
 and it's the masks that used a 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.700
 once a week 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.730
 it's a mask to be sold by 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 amazon can no longer only get and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
 you can get it in these 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.030
 are here been using by the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.030
