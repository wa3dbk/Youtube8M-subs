00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
there's another one right over there of

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.910 
there's another one right over there of

course it's hard to see but this is what
it<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.160> looks<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.700> out<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:30.000> water<00:03:30.780> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it actually looks like out here water is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.430 
it actually looks like out here water is
kind<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.340> murky<00:03:32.810> winds<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.200> really

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
kind of murky winds really really

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.400

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
turning it up that's a check out some of

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.400 
turning it up that's a check out some of
the<00:03:37.500> scenery<00:03:37.950> around<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.319> was

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
the scenery around here and there was

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.129 
the scenery around here and there was
some<00:03:40.560> scenery<00:03:40.859> around<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.870> earlier<00:03:42.870> too

awesome I don't know what the hell that
is<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.079> guess<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.500> an<00:03:46.590> apartment<00:03:47.069> complex

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
is I guess that's an apartment complex

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.070 
is I guess that's an apartment complex
but<00:03:48.540> yeah

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080
