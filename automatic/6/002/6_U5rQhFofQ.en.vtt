dish<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.700> cooks<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.840> four

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
dish this one cooks what can four

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.639 
dish this one cooks what can four
minutes<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.590> something<00:00:42.290> usually<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.379> an

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
minutes or something usually that's an

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.959 
minutes or something usually that's an
attempted<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.640> four<00:00:44.820> guys

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
attempted I think that's four guys

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
attempted I think that's four guys
bremen<00:00:45.600> three<00:00:45.809> minutes<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:48.500> you'll<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
bremen three minutes so you'll get the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
bremen three minutes so you'll get the
garlic<00:00:50.280> flavor<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.539> melts<00:00:51.930> into

on the inside a little less liquid like
for<00:03:09.130> example<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:11.200> could<00:03:11.980> leave<00:03:12.190> out<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.609> type

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
for example I could leave out the type

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.780 
for example I could leave out the type
of<00:03:12.970> vegetable<00:03:13.480> broth<00:03:13.660> now<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:15.040> add<00:03:15.730> it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
of vegetable broth now and just add it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.210 
of vegetable broth now and just add it
at<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.120> end<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:17.290> these<00:03:17.560> vegetables<00:03:17.829> are

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
at the end all these vegetables are

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.720 
at the end all these vegetables are
going<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> give<00:03:18.579> off<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> lot<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.209> liquids<00:03:20.730> now

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
going to give off a lot of liquids now

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.699 
going to give off a lot of liquids now
some<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.269> these<00:03:22.420> ask<00:03:22.660> me<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.079> scorching

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
some of these ask me that scorching

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.640 
some of these ask me that scorching
before

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
major tricks that I've learned over the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.920 
major tricks that I've learned over the
years<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.370> villain<00:03:32.440> tomatoes

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
years is this is the villain tomatoes

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.369 
years is this is the villain tomatoes
and<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:37.010> what<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.310> used<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.760> do<00:03:38.000> when<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.989> cooking

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
and so what I used to do when in cooking

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.660 
and so what I used to do when in cooking
under<00:03:39.590> pressure<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.069> in<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.310> revised

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
under pressure now in the revised

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.630 
under pressure now in the revised
edition<00:03:40.879> I<00:03:41.269> changed<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.319> mean<00:03:42.860> I<00:03:42.950> used<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> go

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
edition I changed it I mean I used to go

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.949 
edition I changed it I mean I used to go
to<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.819> tomatoes<00:03:44.269> in<00:03:44.420> four<00:03:44.660> of<00:03:44.750> error

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
to the tomatoes in four of error

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.509 
to the tomatoes in four of error
messages<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.860> make<00:03:46.010> really<00:03:46.220> simple

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
messages like you can make really simple

00:03:46.519 --> 00:04:25.439 
messages like you can make really simple
recipes

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.120 

so<00:04:26.449> for<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.870> put<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.350> garlic<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.009> the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
so for you put in the garlic and the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.749 
so for you put in the garlic and the
onions<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:29.030> penalty<00:04:29.600> NFL<00:04:30.050> C<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.160> I

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
onions and the penalty NFL C so I

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:48.040 
onions and the penalty NFL C so I
haven't<00:04:32.570> measured<00:04:32.900> carefully<00:04:33.410> but<00:04:46.870> because<00:04:47.870> I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
haven't measured carefully but because I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.540 
haven't measured carefully but because I
think<00:04:48.880> retain<00:04:49.880> more<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.150> its<00:04:50.330> taste<00:04:50.630> and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
think retain more of its taste and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.310 
think retain more of its taste and
texture<00:04:52.550> unit<00:04:52.970> my<00:04:53.090> water<00:04:53.389> really<00:04:53.630> can't<00:04:54.050> come

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
texture unit my water really can't come

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.469 
texture unit my water really can't come
down<00:04:54.500> I<00:05:00.039> think<00:05:01.039> in<00:05:01.310> order<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.760> avoid<00:05:02.060> scorching

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
down I think in order to avoid scorching

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.770 
down I think in order to avoid scorching
I<00:05:02.930> will<00:05:04.990> go<00:05:05.990> o<00:05:06.320> add<00:05:07.220> some<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:08.120> onions<00:05:08.570> are

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
I will go o add some the onions are

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.920 
I will go o add some the onions are
going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.050> give<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.229> a<00:05:09.260> lot<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.560> liquid

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.320 

most<00:05:16.919> coverage<00:05:17.310> requirement<00:05:18.000> needs<00:05:18.180> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
most coverage requirement needs to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:42.499 
most coverage requirement needs to
happen<00:05:38.210> again<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.389> know<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.600> would<00:05:41.509> depend

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
happen again you know that would depend

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.480 
happen again you know that would depend
on<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.840> brought<00:05:43.169> but<00:05:43.410> we<00:05:43.530> have<00:05:43.949> relatively

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
on this brought but we have relatively

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.170 
on this brought but we have relatively
little<00:05:44.789> blood<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:50.370> I'm<00:05:50.520> going<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:50.760> add<00:05:50.940> my

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
little blood so I'm going to add my

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:28.130 
little blood so I'm going to add my
tomatoes<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:07.740> lid<00:06:07.979> is<00:06:25.130> okay
