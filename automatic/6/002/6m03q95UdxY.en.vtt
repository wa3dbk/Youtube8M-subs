will move also out as you can see the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.929 
will move also out as you can see the
head<00:01:45.969> of<00:01:46.179> course<00:01:46.899> will<00:01:47.289> move<00:01:47.709> and<00:01:48.069> then<00:01:48.789> we

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
head of course will move and then we

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.029 
head of course will move and then we
have<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.270> legs<00:01:49.479> which<00:01:49.689> move<00:01:49.959> at<00:01:50.139> the<00:01:50.319> top<00:01:50.560> we

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
have the legs which move at the top we

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.489 
have the legs which move at the top we
have<00:01:51.219> a<00:01:51.429> knee<00:01:51.609> joint<00:01:51.959> section<00:01:52.959> matter<00:01:53.200> moves

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
have a knee joint section matter moves

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.830 
have a knee joint section matter moves
and<00:01:53.799> then<00:01:54.639> we<00:01:54.819> have<00:01:55.029> the<00:01:55.240> thoughts<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.779> that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
and then we have the thoughts of that

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.050 
and then we have the thoughts of that
you<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.439> move<00:01:56.619> as<00:01:56.920> well<00:01:57.219> so<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.490> did<00:01:57.700> get<00:01:57.819> loss

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you can move as well so you did get loss

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.480 
you can move as well so you did get loss
of<00:01:58.649> articulation<00:01:59.649> on<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.100> we<00:02:00.159> do<00:02:00.279> get

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
of articulation on this and we do get

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.389 
of articulation on this and we do get
the<00:02:00.579> wheels<00:02:00.819> to<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.389> side<00:02:01.630> as<00:02:01.899> well<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.069> also

with<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> conscription<00:02:13.090> set<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.319> will<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
with a conscription set you will have to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.540 
with a conscription set you will have to
build<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.400> robot<00:02:16.060> mode<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.569> then

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
build the robot mode and then

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.430 
build the robot mode and then
individually<00:02:18.550> construct<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.690> vehicle<00:02:20.320> mode

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
individually construct the vehicle mode

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.550 
individually construct the vehicle mode
both<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.250> not<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> case

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
both of that is not the case

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.380 
both of that is not the case
and<00:02:22.650> if<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> look<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.240> does

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
and if we have a look in this it does

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.780 
and if we have a look in this it does
show<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.630> how<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> construct<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
show you how to construct it the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.120 
show you how to construct it the
step-by-step<00:02:27.330> lot<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.959> will<00:02:28.080> get<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.740> Lego

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
step-by-step lot you will get in a Lego

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.390 
step-by-step lot you will get in a Lego
or<00:02:29.520> mega<00:02:29.910> bloks<00:02:30.230> etc<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.920> barnacle

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
or mega bloks etc kind of a barnacle

or mega bloks etc kind of a barnacle
looking<00:02:33.060> set<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:34.860> there<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> go<00:02:35.700> on

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
looking set of this but there you go on

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.809 
looking set of this but there you go on
the<00:02:36.330> second<00:02:36.990> step<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.220> after<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
the second step of this after the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.120 
the second step of this after the
construction<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:40.110> does<00:02:40.350> show<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.680> how<00:02:41.069> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
construction it does show you how to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.280 
construction it does show you how to
construct<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.180> fold<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.590> figure<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:45.000> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you would have had to construct both

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.690 
you would have had to construct both

motor but you don't let you go this is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.360 
motor but you don't let you go this is
the<00:03:02.940> red<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.720> translucent<00:03:04.530> case<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.190> comes

the red of translucent case that comes
with<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.630> does<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.230> Autobot

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
with this and it does have the Autobot

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.190 
with this and it does have the Autobot

Wheeljack now and we will let fold him
and<00:03:15.840> construct<00:03:16.319> him<00:03:16.530> into<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.880> vehicle<00:03:18.450> mode

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and construct him into the vehicle mode

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.000 
and construct him into the vehicle mode
and<00:03:20.340> here<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.819> Wheeljack<00:03:21.390> in<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.900> vehicle<00:03:22.470> mode

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
and here is Wheeljack in a vehicle mode

and here is Wheeljack in a vehicle mode
it<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.330> quite<00:03:24.720> an<00:03:24.959> easy<00:03:25.430> transformation<00:03:26.430> a

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
it was quite an easy transformation a

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.030 
it was quite an easy transformation a
little<00:03:26.820> cumbersome<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.540> places<00:03:28.079> and<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.769> few

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
little cumbersome in places and a few

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.819 
little cumbersome in places and a few
places<00:03:29.370> are<00:03:29.850> quite<00:03:30.209> hard<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.709> straighten<00:03:31.709> up

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
places are quite hard to straighten up

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.130 
places are quite hard to straighten up
as<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.340> see<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.700> rear<00:03:33.000> wheels<00:03:33.299> are

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
as you can see the rear wheels are

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.259 
as you can see the rear wheels are
probably<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.890> hardest<00:03:34.920> part<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.760> straighten

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
probably the hardest part to straighten

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.660 
probably the hardest part to straighten
up<00:03:36.390> as<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.260> quite<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.829> large<00:03:38.160> gap<00:03:38.640> between

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
up as there is quite a large gap between

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.990 
up as there is quite a large gap between
the<00:03:39.299> main<00:03:39.540> body<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.260> those<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.400> wheels<00:03:41.640> but

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the main body and those of wheels but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.060 
the main body and those of wheels but
there<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.390> have<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> we<00:03:43.200> get<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> two

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
there you have it we get to the two

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.300 
there you have it we get to the two
blasters<00:03:44.850> at<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.780> top<00:03:46.019> nowhere<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.799> utilize

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
blasters at the top nowhere to utilize

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.789 
blasters at the top nowhere to utilize
this<00:03:47.850> main<00:03:48.660> blaster<00:03:49.290> though<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.680> be

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
this main blaster though it would be

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.650 
this main blaster though it would be
nice<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.190> actually<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.670> fix<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.209> somewhere

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
nice to actually to fix that somewhere

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.220 
nice to actually to fix that somewhere
maybe<00:03:52.560> there<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.280> some<00:03:53.489> where<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.850> could<00:03:54.060> go<00:03:54.930> L

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
maybe there is some where it could go L

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630 
maybe there is some where it could go L
thought<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.590> could<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.859> at<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> front<00:03:56.370> there

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
thought it could go at the front there

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.880 
thought it could go at the front there
but<00:03:56.820> it's<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.630> will<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.380> but<00:03:58.650> there<00:03:58.799> you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
but it's a will or not but there you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.289 
but it's a will or not but there you
have<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> that<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.510> vehicle<00:04:01.350> mode<00:04:01.920> as<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.760> say<00:04:03.120> a

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
have it that is vehicle mode as I say a

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.120 
have it that is vehicle mode as I say a
little<00:04:03.390> cumbersome<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.140> places<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.920> is

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
little cumbersome in places but it is

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.940 
little cumbersome in places but it is
still<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.730> fully<00:04:06.600> functional<00:04:07.380> vehicle<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
still a fully functional vehicle the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.240 
still a fully functional vehicle the
wheels<00:04:08.310> do<00:04:08.820> still<00:04:09.209> work<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.799> will<00:04:10.799> operate

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
wheels do still work and will operate

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.840 
wheels do still work and will operate
properly<00:04:11.700> if<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.920> do<00:04:13.920> transform<00:04:14.730> it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
properly if you do transform it

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.930
