from the iPhones design but I found that
the<00:01:00.000> Ahly<00:01:00.149> frame<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> strangely<00:01:01.260> bulky

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the Ahly frame to be strangely bulky

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
the Ahly frame to be strangely bulky
around<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> sides<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> phone<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.390> there's

around the sides of the phone if there's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
around the sides of the phone if there's
a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.809> weird<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.379> hand<00:01:04.739> almost<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.189> the

a bit weird in your hand almost like the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
probably the worst sound I've ever heard

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
probably the worst sound I've ever heard
coming<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> phone<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.710> phone

however these things are small and quite
nitpicky<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> definitely<00:01:17.070> could<00:01:17.369> be

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
nitpicky and definitely could be

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
nitpicky and definitely could be
overlooked<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.720> no<00:01:18.869> other

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
really big one and that's the signal

really big one and that's the signal
interference<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> huge<00:01:25.020> issue<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
interference is a huge issue with this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
interference is a huge issue with this
case<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> regularly<00:01:27.090> knocks<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.750> bars

isn't great on the whole and I found

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
isn't great on the whole and I found
myself<00:01:32.880> regularly<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.350> three<00:01:34.530> bars

myself regularly with two to three bars

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
myself regularly with two to three bars
throughout<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> day<00:01:35.369> meaning<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.479> I'm

throughout the day meaning that if I'm

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
throughout the day meaning that if I'm
using<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.170> case<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.130> much

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
using this case I'm pretty much

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
using this case I'm pretty much
completely<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.240> connectivity<00:01:39.630> and

completely out of connectivity and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
completely out of connectivity and
that's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> big<00:01:40.500> problem<00:01:40.799> match<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's a big problem match that with the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
that's a big problem match that with the
fact<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> doesn't<00:01:42.689> provide<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.079> best

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
fact that it doesn't provide the best

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.960 
fact that it doesn't provide the best
protection<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.220> you've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.430> yourself<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> bit

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
protection and you've got yourself a bit

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.420 
protection and you've got yourself a bit

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
together and possibly come up with a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.469 
together and possibly come up with a
second<00:01:59.219> variation<00:01:59.490> because<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170 
that idea
the<00:02:01.500> execution<00:02:02.070> wasn't<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.549> great<00:02:02.850> if
