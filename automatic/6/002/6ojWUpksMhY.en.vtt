00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.319
 how about movie friends gamers and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.850
 welcome to a new class video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.940
 plans that good today is going to be 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.640
 fast what are we going to talk quickly 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.680
 about this micro update is not 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.750
 nothing of the other world I had told them 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.419
 from a little before Christmas 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.609
 usually his profile then he gets 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.859
 in quotes a little more generous and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.419
 start to put the acceleration of gems 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 that avoids you must already be 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.640
 seeing they are by one in almost everything 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.100
 just because the word is almost 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.900
 everyone that I decided to make this video in that 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.340
 there is acceleration for example in the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.890
 collectors from abroad and it's hard 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.440
 a gem each or can this climb 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 three hit seven I will 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.140
 do that, taking advantage of the fact that we are here 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.340
 to do with a good acceleration 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 also in the heroes is the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.150
 acceleration of two hours in a gem in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 my good case right now the realito and 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.650
 going up to 19 points and I can not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.880
 but well here I have the queen right now 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.550
 that the use already begins to make the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.860
 acceleration the case of girls also 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 right now it's a single gem then 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.890
 he is also alienated I am going to take advantage 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.780
 because I'm going to be attacking 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.330
 constantly then there 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 we already have the barracks both 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.110
 dark because although the image many 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.909
 they said no this is not so if it is not 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.540
 so good that you can see that if you're in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.790
 one how are 12 this the two gems for 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 both at the same time and the barracks 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 normal and there are ordinary 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.940
 He let them find it because the good thing is that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 have improved I do not have them here they are 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.790
 also one each or the four of a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.280
 hit this one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 and that is practically what I wanted them 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.190
 say however here is something else 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990
 quite important that many of the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 hey Peter but because the gold is not 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 you have an idea you can give us a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.650
 theory and let's talk quickly 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 because I think it is not while 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.120
 he passed them a couple of repetitions of the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 war I think so at least while 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.190
 What do I tell you about how this happened? 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.940
 and well let's show me this 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.800
 this was the bad plan ha ha that moment 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.400
 in which after the update already 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.869
 you can not do repetitions in order 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.880
 Well, I'll quickly tell you which one 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.410
 it's my theory why they did not have us 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.910
 this why they did not do it like the parrot 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 remember that in the update the and 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.020
 the heavy where they added a new 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 level of mines and collectors is 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.970
 relatively new not beyond 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.310
 who has completed two weeks is at 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.709
 point to meet two weeks that of oj the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.520
 on Thursday but they had met two 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.530
 weeks 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.360
 then good sequential did as 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.950
 calculations do not remember that this 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290
 update although good I have was for 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 Christmas was added 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.620
 giant among other things the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.329
 main as we are about to put as 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.579
 what pressure for the purpose of I hope 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.799
 to be was like correcting the 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.260
 stupidity they did with the walls of 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.939
 with the elixir from level 6 to 7 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.739
 I know that many of you are going to say 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.720
 nothing is not like what you ask and that to me 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.400
 it helped me a lot what are you talking about 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.720
 I do not know why I read it 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.980
 comments that leave me not only in 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.409
 youtube but also that they write to me 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.379
 my iphone twitter in bass peter and that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.450
 also good I've been seeing in the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.370
 your profile forums but remember 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.579
 friends and that's like pretty 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.139
 important is to say what up 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.329
 town hall at level 8 and I told you 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.669
 many times I did not suffer where that 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.560
 be and I because I have two villages one 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.980
 age 7 good one of those who have 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.379
 origin 7-18 I do not suffer from that even 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.419
 to them until I understand from that 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.030
 point of view that wins and does not perceive me 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:36.180
 There were more than enough damned sons of 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.669
 bitch salted not however from the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.410
 9 completely changes everything like this already 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.360
 from 9 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 I was on things already of things if 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.890
 there were moments more or less present 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.500
 but in general I was one of the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.960
 coordinates with finding good villages 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.420
 what could not happen this 34 hours 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.730
 looking for a decent village not even 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.640
 a village yes and good a decent one 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.800
 good village I left already once every 34 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.200
 days when before I left every 35 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.090
 searches and that does not just happen to me 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
 passed to millions of people around 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.110
 of the world because they already play alcohol 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.180
 million people and good super is the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.730
 I try to correct this with this going up 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.860
 a level the good thing by taking away from the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:23.400
 modes up to the level of 89 memory 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.200
 of the guys with this one here if it's from 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.350
 89 here you can see it with this one 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.450
 I would like 89 and well what is it 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.580
 happens is that many people if today I was 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.260
 having a very very ugly shortage of 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.450
 elixir that is the first thing that they improve 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.120
 as in my case, climbing up sides 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.560
 collectors of elixir aldo secret already 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.930
 I have all 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.790
 but also after the claw like 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.950
 consideration that says good for this 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.780
 they already have to have minimum as it is called 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.190
 th8 onwards or city hall 8 as you 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.650
 want to say because they do not know which one 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.520
 is this th8 then the town hall 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.700
 in Spanish and generally they already have 13 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 of construction workers as you want 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.310
 say so if they have three in all 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.130
 the days that have passed must have 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.840
 usually and if its what what 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.260
 They were fine and they can see more 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.110
 statistics I'm not afraid I'm super 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.820
 they saw that a lot of people were improving 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.889
 today I had finished improving a better 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.680
 said the elixir collectors without 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.000
 But many continue to improve 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.470
 gold mines that although you see that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.050
 this I already have for example is 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.850
 lack I have these workers improving 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.840
 well here I have one of track that is here 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.820
 is the other one I have the workers improving 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.130
 several of those and I have five to 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.990
 imagine the syntax has only three 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.740
 they were also going to be like an unfair 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.060
 there will be will be to me 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.979
 you also choose a 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.289
 gem when it is improving and missing 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.889
 several days to finish this 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:57.699
 gold mines that but does not mean 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.919
 that when they spend two weeks in theory 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.449
 they should have it and at least that good 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:09.340
 for other things like me that I'm 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:11.620
 using one for one for the for the euro 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.590
 and two for the camps that those who 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.660
 I 'm improving it then, because 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.340
 that I think I insist, I'm not 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.590
 saying this was what happened but it's the 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.440
 logic that I'm using I think that 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.099
 that's what happened so no 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.099
 this 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.780
 so they did not lay the mines 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.960
 this acceleration and that's why you find it 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.280
 10 then good that was just what 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.290
 I want to tell you I hope this video 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.790
 will help you if it was like that you already know that your 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.169
 difference dedication can you leave me 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.090
 your comments if you want what 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.100
 I said is true if you think I'm 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.300
 wrong if I'm wrong I 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100
 I would like your comments to be down 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.870
 because you think I'm wrong in the end 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.130
 I was your friend Peter and we will not be 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.360
 watching in another video of class floor or 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.199
 in any other that I have in the channel 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.199
 for you bye bye 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.130
 all right
