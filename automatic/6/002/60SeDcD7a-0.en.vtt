00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
is it a three or a to watch it's from

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.730 
is it a three or a to watch it's from
behind

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.900 

it's<00:00:13.740> inconclusive<00:00:14.310> even<00:00:15.090> at<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:16.040> is<00:00:17.040> if<00:00:17.730> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's inconclusive even at this is if you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's inconclusive even at this is if you
project<00:00:18.290> the<00:00:19.290> feet<00:00:19.820> it<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.090> stopping

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
project the feet it would be stopping

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300 
project the feet it would be stopping
it'll<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.779> stepping<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> line<00:00:22.560> yeah<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it'll be stepping on the line yeah you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.680 
it'll be stepping on the line yeah you
know<00:00:23.430> once<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> step<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.150> line<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
know once you step on that line it's a

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.230 
know once you step on that line it's a
two-pointer<00:00:25.260> yeah<00:00:25.440> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> angle<00:00:26.940> is<00:00:27.060> from

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
two-pointer yeah so the angle is from

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.380 
two-pointer yeah so the angle is from
behind<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.720> another<00:00:27.900> concurrency<00:00:29.270> but<00:00:30.270> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
behind so another concurrency but the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.359 
behind so another concurrency but the
referee<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> called<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.320> yes<00:00:31.890> let's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
referee is called it a two yes let's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.150 
referee is called it a two yes let's
take<00:00:32.520> another<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.150> it

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.330 

let's<00:00:40.760> see<00:00:41.000> that's<00:00:41.840> one<00:00:42.170> that's<00:00:42.560> one<00:00:42.710> foot<00:00:43.130> and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
let's see that's one that's one foot and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.460 
let's see that's one that's one foot and
he<00:00:43.430> has<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.700> put<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.000> other<00:00:44.150> foot<00:00:44.450> down<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:48.350> was

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
he has to put the other foot down it was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.720 
he has to put the other foot down it was
it<00:00:48.710> looks<00:00:48.920> like<00:00:49.070> he<00:00:49.160> was<00:00:49.280> stepping<00:00:49.430> on<00:00:49.640> the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
it looks like he was stepping on the

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.660 
it looks like he was stepping on the
line

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.430 

one<00:00:56.269> more<00:00:56.449> time<00:00:56.629> let's<00:00:56.870> take<00:00:56.989> one<00:00:57.109> more<00:00:57.170> look

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
one more time let's take one more look

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.840 
one more time let's take one more look
at<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.769> just<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:59.059> be<00:00:59.809> conclusive<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:01.039> then<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
at it just to be conclusive and then the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.950 
at it just to be conclusive and then the
Commissioner<00:01:02.329> will<00:01:02.480> make<00:01:02.690> his<00:01:02.839> ruling

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.260 

if<00:01:08.560> i<00:01:08.680> were<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.950> all<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.250> takes<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.580> put<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:09.970> I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
if i were to all it takes to put that I

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
if i were to all it takes to put that I
tell<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.440> stepping<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.979> line<00:01:12.130> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.320 

but<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:18.610> really<00:01:18.880> not<00:01:19.270> that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
but you know it's really not that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
but you know it's really not that
confusing<00:01:20.050> because<00:01:20.290> he<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.920> angle

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
confusing because he is at the angle

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.630 
confusing because he is at the angle
seems<00:01:23.710> clear<00:01:24.340> enough<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:27.159> now<00:01:27.340> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
seems clear enough but now the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.910 
seems clear enough but now the
Commissioner<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.210> verifying<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.649> a

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
Commissioner is verifying that it is a

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
Commissioner is verifying that it is a
two<00:01:33.280> point<00:01:33.850> shot

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.510 

and<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.190> with<00:01:38.940> finality<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.380> game<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.890> over

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and so with finality this game is over

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.469 
and so with finality this game is over
and<00:01:41.670> goes<00:01:42.090> into<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> record<00:01:43.350> books<00:01:44.360> for<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and goes into the record books for the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.790 
and goes into the record books for the
final<00:01:45.870> score<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:48.060> ain't<00:01:48.240> wrong<00:01:48.479> 70<00:01:49.229> son<00:01:49.530> betta

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
final score we ain't wrong 70 son betta

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.980 
final score we ain't wrong 70 son betta
69<00:01:50.460> each<00:01:50.729> team<00:01:51.030> finishes<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> first<00:01:51.810> round

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
69 each team finishes the first round

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
69 each team finishes the first round
with<00:01:52.229> five<00:01:52.440> wins<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.070> loss<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.550> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
with five wins and one loss and the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
with five wins and one loss and the
crown<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.210> finish<00:01:54.450> number<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.050> all<00:01:55.260> right

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
crown will finish number one all right

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.930 
crown will finish number one all right
and<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.890> some<00:01:56.100> better<00:01:56.280> still<00:01:56.520> has<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.759> been

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
and so some better still has not been

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.090 
and so some better still has not been
able<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> achieve<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.900> sweep<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.830> first

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
able to achieve a sweep of the first

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.420 
able to achieve a sweep of the first
round<00:01:59.369> last<00:02:00.150> year<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.509> course<00:02:00.660> they<00:02:00.869> lost<00:02:01.500> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
round last year of course they lost on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450 
round last year of course they lost on
the<00:02:02.820> first<00:02:03.030> round<00:02:03.330> game<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.810> PCU<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.160> again
