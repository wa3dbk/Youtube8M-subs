seems like a really cool open-ended
combo<00:00:42.780> system<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like but I do understand that it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
like but I do understand that it's
really<00:00:52.559> early<00:00:52.710> build<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
really early build and it's going to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
really early build and it's going to
change<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.410> far<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.770> breaking<00:00:56.309> down

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
change a lot so as far as breaking down

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
change a lot so as far as breaking down
a<00:00:56.550> game<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.120> personally<00:00:57.480> am<00:00:57.780> NOT<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a game I personally am NOT the kind of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
a game I personally am NOT the kind of
guy<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.699> get<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.329> system

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
guy that will really get into the system

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
guy that will really get into the system
mechanics<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.710> level<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> games

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mechanics at this level of the games

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.140 
mechanics at this level of the games
lifespan<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.100> art<00:01:05.280> direction<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
lifespan but the art direction is really

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
lifespan but the art direction is really
interesting<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.720> cool<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.260> personally<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
interesting and cool and personally the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
interesting and cool and personally the
most<00:01:08.729> interesting<00:01:09.270> thing<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.750> game

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
most interesting thing about this game

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
most interesting thing about this game
right<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.590> seeing<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> tekken

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
right now is seeing the tekken

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.020 
right now is seeing the tekken
incarnations<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> moves<00:01:13.970> kind<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
incarnations of the moves kind of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
incarnations of the moves kind of
implemented<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> new<00:01:16.200> system<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.860> think

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
implemented in this new system i think

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
implemented in this new system i think
it's<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.850> interesting<00:01:18.000> seeing<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.840> they

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's really interesting seeing what they

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's really interesting seeing what they
did<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.680> ranges<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> moves<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
did with it the ranges of moves the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
did with it the ranges of moves the
heights<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> moves<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:22.170> has<00:01:22.350> invincibility

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
heights of moves what has invincibility

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
heights of moves what has invincibility
what's<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.780> cancellable<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.930> like

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
what's like cancellable it's like

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.649 
what's like cancellable it's like
totally<00:01:25.590> unpredictable<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.090> it's

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
totally unpredictable for me it's it's

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
totally unpredictable for me it's it's
way<00:01:28.080> beyond<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
way beyond what you would get from a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
way beyond what you would get from a
tekken<00:01:30.600> sequel<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.619> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
tekken sequel because you know they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
tekken sequel because you know they

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the combo system in my opinion is by far

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.990 
the combo system in my opinion is by far
by<00:02:09.580> far<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:10.230> best<00:02:11.230> part<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.819> of

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
by far the best part of the of the of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.240 
by far the best part of the of the of
the<00:02:13.209> system<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.989> combos<00:02:14.440> jabbing<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the system the combos jabbing out of the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.039 
the system the combos jabbing out of the
air<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.549> very<00:02:15.819> Tekken<00:02:16.330> style<00:02:16.629> thing<00:02:16.870> where

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
air is a very Tekken style thing where

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.960 
air is a very Tekken style thing where
like<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.739> know<00:02:17.860> they<00:02:18.190> try<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.459> get<00:02:18.670> off<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
ground you catch them with like a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.930 
ground you catch them with like a
crouching<00:02:20.470> strong<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:21.129> crouching<00:02:21.280> jab<00:02:21.700> and
