00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.050
 I will not dispute nasipnikka former Kenshin 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.860
 Oh this time it 's in the fourth quarter 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.930
 Now time to go forehand ground to catch a story or do not know the city Muffler &amp; 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.010
 When they see the cups 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.510
 If you can not beat it in place, the better you speak the Obama 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.410
 When we dance, we get in the game. 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 There are no signs of that excuse, in this place, so move on to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 Very important and agile behaviors are important. 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:44.610
 So Lee went the seat cover and went down the hall and coming back these operations are 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:50.060
 So it happens repeatedly, so you know , 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.960
 To tell you how to practice some movement 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:59.420
 I do not think you guys are cheating on you now. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.160
 If you look here now and you get this sound , 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.930
 Do you have any special skills? 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.520
 I have not slept in this way so I can not carry it with my hand now 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.370
 To people 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.960
 So the current sticks are so send 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.890
 I wrote spend now sent away in this manner sends it to accumulate Heo Solji 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.630
 The player 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.870
 I'll hit the Feast of hers that what people do to open the lid hole 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.680
 If for example, bear the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.960
 This year, because the flight itself is irregular, 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.330
 Truncated 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.180
 Now if you follow this lid, you will concentrate on the body itself. 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.430
 The other is to be moved automatically 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.500
 So, with this simple props, you can make your feet move naturally . 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.980
 When you are in the nose 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.650
 You can move a lot more aggressively 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:58.310
 As the name also because it is difficult to hand dance moves under the hope these technologies 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.150
 Tennis is difficult because this coordination action is worth it because it moves 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.320
 Will 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:08.510
 So moving these feet is automatically done unconsciously. 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.130
 As a result , the disposal of disposable items 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.280
 When you are as 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:21.200
 This performance is even make the top look fast moving automatically to the next 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 Late nights and cool at the same time it momen, as the movement in the changche movement and racket 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.170
 I have to get up. 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 The word we're able to happen this way so that the natural mechanism 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.959
 Money is almost never going to be one . 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.860
 These methods are not related to intelligent control increasing support gown 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 When Olke picks it up, she'll close the lid tightly. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.850
 Through the garbage, 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.640
 Oh, I'm bringing it together and I'm going to try it on our players. 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.840
 It's very effective. 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.060
 No need to support the movement to become so over the lid again as the props 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.130
 After you've practiced it, 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.960
 I'll try to stop with a real ball again . Much more winch . 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:15.290
 And tell you that I've seen the results that come when the island motion design 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:19.550
 We also mobilize you and move on to the good part now, should not mwonyamyeon 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.400
 So you can get hurt in a normal stance, so there is a move to this 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.720
 2 Earthenware is important, so dancing is important from the gang 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.920
 For more ways that these can naturally be trained much more now 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:36.550
 You better coat it in reading the same 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.550
 You can hit the ball well with your quick moves. 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 Ah 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.890
