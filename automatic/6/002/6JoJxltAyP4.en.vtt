00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this tastes something like a I think

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.469 
this tastes something like a I think
it's<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:15.869> apple<00:01:16.290> martini<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.329> go

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
healthier alternative this is a great

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
healthier alternative this is a great
way<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.649> go<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.219> cut<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.579> you<00:01:24.149> have<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.329> regular

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
way to go so cut up you have a regular

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
way to go so cut up you have a regular
blender<00:01:24.719> cut<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> small<00:01:26.310> pieces

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
blender cut it up in small pieces

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
blender cut it up in small pieces
probably<00:01:27.570> even<00:01:27.719> smaller<00:01:28.079> than<00:01:28.170> bases<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
probably even smaller than bases that I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
probably even smaller than bases that I
have<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> make<00:01:29.729> sure<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.149> your<00:01:30.869> blender

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
have here to make sure that your blender

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.440 
have here to make sure that your blender
is<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:31.979> able<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.280> grab<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.210> Apple

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is going to be able to grab the Apple

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.889 
is going to be able to grab the Apple
and<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> usually<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.270> even<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.659> my

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
and then what I usually do even for my

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.420 
and then what I usually do even for my
own<00:01:36.930> blender<00:01:37.500> start<00:01:37.799> off<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.039> some<00:01:38.219> clean

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
own blender start off with some clean

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
own blender start off with some clean
purified<00:01:38.729> water<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.299> probably<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.719> about<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
purified water I probably see about a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
purified water I probably see about a
quarter<00:01:40.259> cup<00:01:40.289> worth<00:01:40.700> just<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> going

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
quarter cup worth just to get it going

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
quarter cup worth just to get it going
so<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.869> will<00:01:43.049> grip<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> blades<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> pull<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so it will grip the blades and pull the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.580 
so it will grip the blades and pull the
Apple<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.180> make<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.200> ginger

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
Apple in and make up and then ginger

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
Apple in and make up and then ginger
ginger<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.789> your<00:01:47.969> taste<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
ginger is to your taste now for the
