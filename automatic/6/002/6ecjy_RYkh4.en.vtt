 host claudio who organized 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 the event 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.210
 well if we worked five months and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.049
 half so I think it's right to be 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.530
 reassured by this great result 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.939
 which we have obtained is therefore thank you 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 all those who have allowed us to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.780
 do 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 I especially thank the region 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 campania that allowed us to stay 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 here to do something very serious a lot 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 nice doctor in particular 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.829
 is what gave us the opportunity to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.439
 being able to do this event is part of the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.270
 book of records 293 thrown rolls 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429
 born 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.369
 someone says we're a few dozen 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.619
 below however it is equal equal to us from 263 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.439
 we certainly surpassed by great 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.079
 long the record so we're in go 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.819
 good equal if there are not 293 only one 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.039
 we are less or less, however, we are 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.799
 a revenge after ten years 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.659
 from the previous record attempt 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.369
 organized by the same associations 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.189
 that in September 2004 on the occasion 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.179
 of the pizza world they had tried to 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.110
 make a pizza with a diameter of 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:08.720
 5.19 meters cooked in a 6.70 m oven 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.090
 the attempt at the time failed this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.510
 time we were satisfied 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 in the words of Neapolitan pizza makers 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.170
 great satisfaction because there 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.060
 we have been working for a long time is the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.190
 greatest satisfaction is that all 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.959
 Neapolitan pizza makers we were able to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.209
 make this record 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.670
 honestly we did 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.560
 Americans are not new 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.860
 well look I tell you it was something that 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.750
 we were entitled to pizza and ours 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.530
 the record had to be ours 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.049
 so it's a great satisfaction 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.959
 luck yes we finally did it 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.850
 to overcome this I think we are more than 300 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.709
 pride that we all have to bear 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.730
 because we Neapolitans are the reals 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.170
 pizza maker 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.000
 for this we owe enthusiasm among the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.850
 kids from the association all at school 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.639
 of nuzzetti tones that have ventured 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.250
 in the record but the kids all at school 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.560
 they are boys like the others 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.980
 this is a beautiful record because 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.380
 as I said before a particular flavor 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.930
 it's not just the taste of pizza and the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.599
 taste of the fact that in Naples just a 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.459
 Naples in this disgraced city yes 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.130
 they can do very nice things 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.959
 very funny even with one eye or 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.430
 better with the heart on the right side 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.430
 from the most fragile part
