00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you're going to divide your hair into

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.810 
you're going to divide your hair into
three<00:00:41.100> sections<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:46.160> put<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.789> right

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
three sections I put one on my right

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.360 
three sections I put one on my right
shoulder<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:48.960> left<00:00:49.230> shoulder<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.800> one

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in the back so that I won't get confused

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.279 
in the back so that I won't get confused
with<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.829> hair<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.489> working<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.289> then

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
with the first section I'm going to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
with the first section I'm going to
divide<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.480> three<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> i'm<00:00:58.829> just

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
divide that into three and i'm just

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
divide that into three and i'm just
going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> start<00:00:59.489> braiding<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> way

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
going to start braiding that all the way

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
going to start braiding that all the way
to<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.020> edge<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.640> i<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> way

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to the edge and when i get all the way

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
to the edge and when i get all the way
to<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> end<00:01:03.570> i'm<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.439> take<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to the end i'm just going to take a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
to the end i'm just going to take a
small<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.670> black<00:01:05.880> elastic<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.900> i'm<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.440 
small little black elastic and i'm just
going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> tie<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> finish<00:01:09.119> off<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to tie that off to finish off the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
going to tie that off to finish off the
braid<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> second<00:01:14.520> section<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
braid then with the second section of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240 
braid then with the second section of
hair<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.720> i'm<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.009> divide

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
hair in the back i'm going to divide

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.100 
hair in the back i'm going to divide
that<00:01:17.640> into<00:01:17.909> three<00:01:18.240> sections<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that into three sections as well and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
that into three sections as well and
just<00:01:19.229> braid<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> exactly<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.250> i<00:01:20.490> did<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
just braid it exactly like i did for the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
just braid it exactly like i did for the
first<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> make<00:01:22.740> sure<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
first one and you want to make sure that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
first one and you want to make sure that
they<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:23.909> similar<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they look pretty similar and when you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
they look pretty similar and when you
tie<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.170> off<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> same

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
tie them off that there at the same

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.680 
tie them off that there at the same
around<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:28.020> areas

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.850 

now<00:01:33.690> I'm<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.900> tying<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.380> off<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.740> an

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
now I'm just tying that off with an

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.740 
now I'm just tying that off with an
elastic<00:01:35.130> exactly<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> first<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
elastic exactly like the first one and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
elastic exactly like the first one and
now<00:01:37.170> we're<00:01:37.320> moving<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.860> third<00:01:38.159> section

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
now we're moving on to the third section

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
now we're moving on to the third section
where<00:01:39.180> i'm<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.930> divide<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.680> into

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
where i'm going to divide that into

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
where i'm going to divide that into
three<00:01:41.250> sections<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.909> braid<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> exactly<00:01:42.750> like

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
three sections and braid it exactly like

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
three sections and braid it exactly like
the<00:01:43.080> other<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the other two so they're all going to be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.800 
the other two so they're all going to be
like<00:01:45.030> triplets

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.149 

now<00:01:52.810> when<00:01:52.990> i<00:01:53.049> get<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.350> bottom<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:53.950> going

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
now when i get to the bottom just going

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.280 
now when i get to the bottom just going
to<00:01:54.280> tie<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.729> off<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:55.060> an<00:01:55.180> elastic<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.840> now

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
to tie that off with an elastic and now

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.500 
to tie that off with an elastic and now
you<00:01:56.350> have<00:01:56.619> three<00:01:56.650> braids<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:58.330> those

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
you have three braids and with those

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.690 
you have three braids and with those
three<00:01:58.750> braids<00:01:59.049> you're<00:01:59.260> just<00:01:59.409> going<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.770> write

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
three braids you're just going to write

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.550 
three braids you're just going to write
it<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:01.180> like<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.360> regular<00:02:01.600> braid<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.259> instead

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
it just like a regular braid so instead

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.680 
it just like a regular braid so instead
of<00:02:02.619> three<00:02:03.220> sections<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.700> hair<00:02:03.729> you're<00:02:04.479> going

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
of three sections of hair you're going

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.270 
of three sections of hair you're going
to<00:02:04.780> be<00:02:04.869> braiding<00:02:05.200> three<00:02:05.409> sections<00:02:05.830> or<00:02:05.950> braids

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
to be braiding three sections or braids

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.340 
to be braiding three sections or braids
so<00:02:06.970> just<00:02:07.180> do<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.450> all<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.720> way<00:02:07.930> until<00:02:08.080> you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
so just do that all the way until you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.910 
so just do that all the way until you
get<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.649> end<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:11.440> like<00:02:11.590> how<00:02:11.770> this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.350 
get to the end I really like how this
turned<00:02:12.100> out<00:02:12.489> because<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:12.910> kind<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.120> looks<00:02:13.300> like

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
turned out because it kind of looks like

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.820 
turned out because it kind of looks like
a<00:02:13.450> fishtail<00:02:13.959> although<00:02:14.260> it's<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.709> a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
