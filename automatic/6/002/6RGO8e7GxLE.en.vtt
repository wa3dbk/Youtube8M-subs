lightning start well the parade lab is
obviously<00:00:18.650> reasonably<00:00:19.650> intense<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.609> terms<00:00:20.670> of

obviously reasonably intense in terms of

obviously reasonably intense in terms of
how<00:00:21.330> busy<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
how busy you are what you have to do and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
then do a physical start in order to see

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
then do a physical start in order to see
what<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.759> grip<00:00:32.940> level<00:00:33.300> everything<00:00:34.140> works

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
what is your grip level everything works

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.520 
what is your grip level everything works
well<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> you'll<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.969> ready<00:00:36.210> after<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> one

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
well and you'll be ready after this one

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
well and you'll be ready after this one
you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> contradiction<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you have a contradiction because you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.010 
you have a contradiction because you
need<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> keep<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> aging<00:00:41.190> temperature<00:00:41.579> low

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
need to keep the aging temperature low

need to keep the aging temperature low
fuel<00:00:43.020> consumption<00:00:43.410> low<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> same

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
fuel consumption low but at the same

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
fuel consumption low but at the same
time<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> work<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.539> tyres<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.410> warm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
time you have to work your tyres to warm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
time you have to work your tyres to warm
them<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> keep<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> wax<00:00:48.090> hot

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
them up and you have to keep the wax hot

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
them up and you have to keep the wax hot
because<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.350> mean<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> worst<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because I mean the worst you can have is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
because I mean the worst you can have is

this<00:01:10.590> respect<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.080> most<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> lap

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this respect you go for most of the lap

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
this respect you go for most of the lap
on<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.340> easy<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.180> keeping<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.869> brakes

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
on an easy way just keeping your brakes

and<00:01:16.290> tires<00:01:16.500> warm<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> last<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.390> bit

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and tires warm for the last little bit

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
and tires warm for the last little bit
before<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> grid<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.670> the

before you go to the grid that's the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
before you go to the grid that's the
most<00:01:21.689> intense<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
most intense because then you have to do
