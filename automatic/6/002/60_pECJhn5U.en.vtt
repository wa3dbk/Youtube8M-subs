00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.500 
here you know it's all it's the middle
building<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:27.129> also<00:02:27.550> good<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.760> control<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.480> i

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
building is also good to control but i

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.910 
building is also good to control but i
find<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.019> little<00:02:29.110> bit<00:02:29.379> easier<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.830> little

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
find this a little bit easier a little

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.820 
find this a little bit easier a little
bit<00:02:30.129> better<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.569> play<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.230> passive

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
bit better if you just play very passive

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.960 
bit better if you just play very passive
meaning<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.340> know<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.549> don't<00:02:33.879> just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
meaning you know you don't just

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
meaning you know you don't just
constantly<00:02:34.780> rush<00:02:35.080> out<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:36.549> know

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
constantly rush out and you know

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.789 
constantly rush out and you know
challenge<00:02:37.420> them<00:02:37.599> even<00:02:37.900> though<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.590> know<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
challenge them even though you know the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.960 
challenge them even though you know the
rounds<00:02:39.069> going<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> lot<00:02:39.730> longer<00:02:40.260> um<00:02:41.970> you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
rounds going to take a lot longer um you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.670 
rounds going to take a lot longer um you
can<00:02:43.180> actually<00:02:43.540> be<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.660> lot<00:02:43.870> more<00:02:43.900> successful

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
can actually be a lot more successful

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.479 
can actually be a lot more successful
which<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.099> good<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:47.200> solo<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.950> recommend

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
which is good so for solo I recommend

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.819 
which is good so for solo I recommend
keeping<00:02:50.099> side<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.250> hand<00:02:51.519> if<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.750> not
