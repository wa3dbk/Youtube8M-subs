00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
different individuals and I think when

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
different individuals and I think when
you<00:02:22.180> personalize<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:23.019> then<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.769> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you personalize one then you get the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.650 
you personalize one then you get the
best<00:02:24.040> results<00:02:24.580> I'm<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.180> giving<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.510> hundred

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
percent to because this essentially gave

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.020 
percent to because this essentially gave
a<00:02:27.970> hundred<00:02:28.570> percent<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.560> did<00:02:29.830> say<00:02:30.130> earlier

world so I can't wait to get I do it's a
nice<00:03:10.610> area<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.620> for<00:03:12.620> nationals

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
nice area but for nationals

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.070 
nice area but for nationals
Ingrid<00:03:14.720> what<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.050> next<00:03:15.500> her<00:03:15.830> so<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.120> think<00:03:17.660> she's

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
Ingrid what is next her so I think she's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.380 
Ingrid what is next her so I think she's
done<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.769> their<00:03:18.950> mature<00:03:19.370> level<00:03:19.760> she's<00:03:20.180> already

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
done in their mature level she's already

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.780 
done in their mature level she's already
completed<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.840> few<00:03:20.989> times<00:03:21.230> kilometer<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.400> this

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
completed a few times kilometer and this

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.580 
completed a few times kilometer and this
is<00:03:22.910> already<00:03:23.239> accomplished<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.290> think

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
is already accomplished this so I think

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.960
