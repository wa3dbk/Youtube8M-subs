00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
can't find a good video on how to draw

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.470 
can't find a good video on how to draw
the<00:00:04.560> cervical<00:00:05.009> triangle<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:05.850> here<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.150> goes

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
the cervical triangle so here it goes

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.000 
the cervical triangle so here it goes
it's<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.720> really<00:00:06.990> quick<00:00:07.200> simple<00:00:07.470> way<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.710> drop

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
it's a really quick simple way to drop

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.780 
it's a really quick simple way to drop
it<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.790> start<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.150> by<00:00:09.330> drawing<00:00:10.550> one<00:00:11.550> large

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it you start out by drawing one large

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.000 
it you start out by drawing one large
square<00:00:14.960> and<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.619> our<00:00:16.740> knit

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
square and this is going to be our knit

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.760 
square and this is going to be our knit
so<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> lateral

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so this is going to be from the lateral

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.740 
so this is going to be from the lateral
view<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> anterior<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> close<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
view this is anterior this is close to a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.400

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
going even have the posterior belly of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690 
going even have the posterior belly of
the<00:01:37.290> digastric<00:01:37.439> come<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> mastoid

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the digastric come from the mastoid

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.130 
the digastric come from the mastoid
process<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:40.280> see<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> high<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.720> anterior

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
process I see a high of all the anterior

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.910 
process I see a high of all the anterior
portion<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.189> comes<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.920> sympathies

portion of it comes up to my sympathies
mental<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> posterior<00:01:53.450> belly<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
mental this is the posterior belly of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
mental this is the posterior belly of
your<00:01:54.990> digastric<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.390> anterior<00:01:58.729> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
your digastric this is the anterior like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.899 
your digastric this is the anterior like
a<00:01:59.759> straight

so as you see already we have our

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.109 
so as you see already we have our
submental<00:02:05.869> triangle<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:07.610> also<00:02:07.789> have<00:02:08.090> our

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
submental triangle we also have our

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.870 
submental triangle we also have our
submandibular<00:02:08.690> triangle<00:02:09.410> next<00:02:10.250> we're<00:02:10.759> going

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
submandibular triangle next we're going

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.270 
submandibular triangle next we're going
to<00:02:10.940> draw<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.330> more<00:02:11.510> muscle<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.980> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
to draw one more muscle it's going to be

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.570
