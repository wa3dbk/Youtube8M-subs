00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 to a new video of game with me 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.790
 childrens toys we will now 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.820
 Together, the Barbie fringed poplar 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 We try to fill it as a whole 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.779
 first time the pool with water I do 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.350
 this time here cups or 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.350
 glasses way 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.200
 that should be enough 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 and now let's have a look 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 individual functions to our first 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.379
 we already have puppy dogs 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 positioned on the jump board behind 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.220
 is a small lever 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.309
 if I press the I show you that 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.230
 motto without Munich 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.230
 then this board works out and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.619
 it will make a kind of catapult now 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.740
 we put chicken on the squares 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.610
 ready go 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.890
 I already pressed before me 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.050
 if we wish it, we have renounced 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 Now a little further back 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.140
 position 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.160
 then the track is a bit different 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 On your marks, get set, go 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.920
 then he makes a side me 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.390
 do not know if you saw that if the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.360
 he really turns over here 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.720
 actually jumps normally 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:38.880
 12 and if we go a bit further 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 rear position so that he 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.560
 with one leg still on it, so to speak 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:53.569
 board stands with the other on the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.569
 catapult then he makes a page 12 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.149
 did you see it? 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.349
 that was the catapult you can do now 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 then this dog with water 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.750
 Soak it by putting it on the back 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:13.290
 Press and hold it briefly under water 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 and then he would have to spit 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.410
 I did too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.290
 that is namely rubber in come undone 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.750
 so crumpled in smaller 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.870
 tongue breaker and then just behind 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.120
 press on it and the dog squirts 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.380
 water from the mouth now we look 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260
 look at the slide 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.920
 down here on the slide such a small one 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.550
 lever must always be up 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.470
 then it will be such a small zacke 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.540
 and then we have our dog here 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.850
 seat made of hard plastic and not made 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 gummi and there we are now the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.910
 fold back legs so that he too 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.540
 can slip 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.890
 that stays that way and now we leave 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.890
 let him run down the slide 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.730
 On your marks, get set, go 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.930
 did you see it i show you this 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.970
 so again at Munich again 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.910
 fold back legs on the slide 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.390
 sit the jig still looks here 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.890
 get out and then get ready on the squares 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.459
 there was the side and her team determined 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.950
 seen 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.920
 so is the set and the doggie 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.940
 Do a newspaper or in English 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.130
 flip in papua 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.500
 You can still find the puppy here in 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.070
 So put the dog bone in 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 our pillow and leave it again 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.500
 slide down 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.720
 He blew everything away even that 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:58.080
 other puppy dogs on the jump board and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.510
 get the bone out again and let it go 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.930
 time this little gray Munich ago 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.930
 slip 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:15.610
 get ready for the squares 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.750
 no page and it would be one too 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.220
 a bit crazy I think if then 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.470
 even the pillow here a side 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.090
 makes me think but that it is a 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.820
 a little bit better if we have this 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:33.160
 make it down, that's what I think 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.400
 namely only the dog where you the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.870
 legs behind a pinch can work so 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.610
 it works a bit too 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 better 123 yes unfortunately has our dog 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 thrown out of the pillow during the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.720
 return journey 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.620
 We'll be our barbie doll 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.900
 let slip 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.400
 she can not even pull me to the train 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.980
 legs we can also in such a 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.600
 Seating position bring me 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:10.030
 are you ready 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.250
 on the squares finished barbie power 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.860
 of course no newspaper but we can 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.030
 even try this jag up too 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.290
 I think then she will stay 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.090
 Definitely on the slide she has now 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:28.030
 even very wet hair makes natural 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.620
 nothing on the courts ready to go 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.169
 in the head over almost the slide 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.220
 fallen down so this is jagged 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.930
 possible only for this plastic 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.180
 and let slip by the one 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.760
 unit can pinch the back legs 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.500
 so he does a side otherwise 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.630
 do you prefer the pip down 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.600
 even if you put this dog on the pillow 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.600
 slip and barby also 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:02.400
 the hair out somehow bring this 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.780
 to get the dolphin to get out of the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.660
 Hard plastic is on the packaging 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.360
 that was both this little rubber 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.350
 Munich as well as the dolphin water 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.750
 can inject because the duck happens 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.490
 now nothing and you can also dolphin 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.290
 Do not crush like that because he's just tough 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.340
 there are no bubbles coming out 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.740
 that's always a sign 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.860
 for that toy then with 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.370
 I think that seems to fill water 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.370
 not to work 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.560
 I have just a guide 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.510
 you have to read now also into the 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.340
 water make that the bottom of the foot has 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.420
 a hole and with your foot you can 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.800
 then absorb the water, so to speak 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.800
 Just order in there and now 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.870
 Press several times on the floating tire 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:02.250
 and then the dolphin would have to do that 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:04.380
 water splash out still happened 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.870
 nothing you have seen now 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.620
 there came a real fountain from the 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.940
 dolphin 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.940
 I'd ran times closer to you 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.280
 So that seems to work 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.500
 I only asked myself who defined 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.229
 made of hard plastic is that barbie 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.139
 down here has a hole in the foot around that 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.940
 water to suck with the 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.900
 Squeaky Duck together is actually 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.470
 a cool idea 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.990
 You have to first come to it was like 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.659
 it is now soaking wet her dogs 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.840
 also one or the other times here 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:43.580
 get really wet 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.349
 barbie waves already we say goodbye 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.190
 now also from you i hope the video 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.690
 you liked it 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.490
 give me a thumbs up
