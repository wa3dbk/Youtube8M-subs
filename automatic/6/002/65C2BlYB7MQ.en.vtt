fountain<00:00:18.930> which<00:00:19.199> also<00:00:20.330> serves<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.230> filter

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
fountain which also serves as a filter

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.939 
fountain which also serves as a filter
that<00:00:23.990> water<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> comes<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:25.619> coming<00:00:25.830> out

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that water that comes that's coming out

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
that water that comes that's coming out
of<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.310> clean<00:00:26.910> water<00:00:27.210> filtering

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
of is actually clean water filtering

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
of is actually clean water filtering
from<00:00:28.080> I'll<00:00:28.680> show<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> focus

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
from I'll show you as we kind of focus

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.930 
from I'll show you as we kind of focus
in<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.740> bit<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.969> tank<00:00:33.210> itself

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
in a little bit more on the tank itself

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.290 
in a little bit more on the tank itself
the<00:00:35.940> water<00:00:36.149> goes<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:37.040> get<00:00:38.040> filtered<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the water goes in get filtered as it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
the water goes in get filtered as it
gets<00:00:39.480> pulled<00:00:39.719> through<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.020> bottom<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:40.530> got

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
gets pulled through the bottom there got

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
gets pulled through the bottom there got
an<00:00:41.040> LED<00:00:41.460> light<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.719> couple<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> other<00:00:43.620> D

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
an LED light as well a couple of other D

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.299 
an LED light as well a couple of other D
lights<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:45.920> filtered<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> then

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
lights in there is filtered and then

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.910 
lights in there is filtered and then
they<00:00:47.399> come<00:00:47.550> back<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.969> through<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.920> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
they come back up through here and the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.170 
they come back up through here and the
processor<00:00:50.430> makes<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> nice<00:00:51.980> relaxing

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
with the with the white LED lights that

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.100 
with the with the white LED lights that
it<00:02:00.580> has<00:02:00.700> I'm<00:02:00.940> going<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.150> shut<00:02:01.330> off<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.630> light<00:02:01.810> I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
it has I'm going to shut off the light I

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.230 
it has I'm going to shut off the light I
got<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> heater<00:02:03.160> in<00:02:03.280> there<00:02:03.550> too<00:02:03.700> because<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:04.060> just

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
got a heater in there too because I just

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.780 
got a heater in there too because I just
think<00:02:04.450> fish<00:02:04.780> like<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.770> water<00:02:05.980> warm<00:02:06.370> at<00:02:06.580> around

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
think fish like the water warm at around

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.750 
think fish like the water warm at around
75<00:02:07.330> degrees<00:02:07.800> although<00:02:08.800> they<00:02:09.100> say<00:02:09.280> goldfish

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
75 degrees although they say goldfish

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.290 
75 degrees although they say goldfish
can<00:02:10.000> are<00:02:10.239> cold<00:02:10.869> water<00:02:11.110> first<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.739> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
can are cold water first you know I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.180 
can are cold water first you know I
think<00:02:13.300> they're<00:02:13.660> happier<00:02:14.019> in<00:02:14.350> warm<00:02:14.709> water<00:02:14.890> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
think they're happier in warm water so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
think they're happier in warm water so
that's<00:02:15.340> why<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.360> RAM<00:02:16.540> needs<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
that's why I have and the RAM needs a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.710 
that's why I have and the RAM needs a
warm<00:02:17.140> water<00:02:17.320> here's<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> here's<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.000> tank<00:02:19.420> what

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
warm water here's a here's the tank what

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.530 
warm water here's a here's the tank what
it<00:02:19.810> looks<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.050> with<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.620> lights<00:02:21.070> off<00:02:24.540> that's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
it looks like with the lights off that's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.970 
it looks like with the lights off that's
pretty<00:02:25.750> impressive<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.320> really<00:02:26.590> nice<00:02:26.739> and
