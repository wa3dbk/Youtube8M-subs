lesson that will always live record get
a<00:00:32.040> ground<00:00:32.460> war<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.620> but<00:00:34.940> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
a ground war for now on but the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.310 
a ground war for now on but the
combination<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.480> two<00:00:36.600> videos<00:00:36.899> i<00:00:37.050> think<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
combination of two videos i think is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.310 
combination of two videos i think is
like<00:00:37.440> 104<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> i<00:00:38.700> don't<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.899> something

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
like 104 and i don't know for something

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.180 
like 104 and i don't know for something
like<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.010> matters

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
like that not that it really matters

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
like that not that it really matters
because<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> same<00:00:42.180> game<00:00:42.480> but

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
because it's not all the same game but

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.819 
because it's not all the same game but
at<00:00:42.750> least<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.989> entertaining<00:00:43.079> gameplay<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
at least it's entertaining gameplay to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.760 
at least it's entertaining gameplay to
watch<00:00:44.040> nonetheless<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> hopefully<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> do

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
watch nonetheless so hopefully you do

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
watch nonetheless so hopefully you do
enjoy<00:00:47.160> them<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.850> middle<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.210> come

so<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:52.330> kind<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.630> turnoff<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.900> me<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.110> like

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
so that's kind of a turnoff to me I like

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.130 
so that's kind of a turnoff to me I like
search<00:04:54.000> but<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.150> know<00:04:55.360> they're<00:04:55.630> basing<00:04:55.960> enough

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
search but I know they're basing enough

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.110 
search but I know they're basing enough
of<00:04:56.320> like<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> know<00:04:56.530> MLG<00:04:57.010> rules<00:04:57.250> or<00:04:57.550> whatever

of like you know MLG rules or whatever

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.960 
of like you know MLG rules or whatever
but<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.390> think<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:58.900> just<00:04:58.930> think<00:04:59.350> they<00:04:59.730> had<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> good

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
but I think I just think they had a good

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.050 
but I think I just think they had a good
intention<00:05:01.540> with<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.780> but<00:05:01.960> they<00:05:02.110> failed

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
intention with it but they failed

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.900 
intention with it but they failed
getting<00:05:04.320> people<00:05:05.580> attracted<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:06.880> guess

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
getting people attracted to it I guess
