00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 waler have n't seen you in a team for a long time 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.540
 tell as a rule before time where 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 played how much let's say you are satisfied 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.119
 the period has passed itself but I have been half a year 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.810
 in rent in Ryazan with his coach 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.590
 who I was still in children's school there 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 Got a little game experience already 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.079
 men's football then I was invited to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.489
 Penza Victor Bulat already familiar wings 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 probably here I have a lot too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.770
 he learned more technical football 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.489
 he tries so hard to play 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 football more or less pass combination 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.379
 technical football beautiful for the audience 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.690
 for the fans I feel pretty good 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.690
 spent this period learned a lot 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.780
 quite felt the difference between 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 words that moat youth 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 first rivals how to play before 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 in the youth championship and yet 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 professional football what is it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 is and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 in your opinion was or say so 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.159
 this is a more efficient time from the point 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.079
 of view 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.869
 professional growth precisely because 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.200
 that rivals are already others of course god 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.130
 because it can be played by men 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.020
 already more power football plus with us in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.679
 the team had players who play 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.789
 Premier leagues such as Kalashnikov or 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:49.020
 which denis kiselev 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.869
 learn that suggest and i think 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.229
 it was a big plus for us and for the guys 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.840
 young then playing gets such an experience 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.700
 second league 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.610
 connection all this time some kind of maintained 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.989
 with wings with coaches with the club was 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 desire still commitments pestilence and 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:10.619
 come back of course it's already my second 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 house you can say i'm already here in 2010 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.790
 so much desire to return to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 Samara and I hope it will work out. 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 Now you already talked with the coach 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.970
 how much does it count linear 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.310
 talked yet talked now goes to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.940
 trusting part she is probably the most 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.130
 heavy 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.680
 in terms of loads 2 pink 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.239
 training from yourself probably looking for and jelly 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.100
 because the speeds are slightly different 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.720
 is it a premiership honor 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.340
 preseason preparation to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.290
 faced in other teams 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.120
 Yes, not very much everywhere at the training camp 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.290
 run everywhere you need to the maximum 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 Well, as in the season, in principle, here goes 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.790
 the foundation is laid for the season so 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 he's everywhere about the same speed yes 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 here it is necessary to think more quickly 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.410
 faster faster do well and for sure 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.930
 Naturally, but the opponent is physics 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.840
 everywhere it is about the same in the second 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.970
 league in 1 some examples dicked as far as 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.900
 you still have a contract and if now 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.570
 there will be a choice 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.090
 again somewhere like rent and play 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.350
 or stay in the wings but as 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.590
 reserve player and you would prefer 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.160
 now we don't know faha about the future 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.160
 we'll see
