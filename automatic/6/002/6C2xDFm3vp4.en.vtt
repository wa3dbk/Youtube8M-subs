I<00:00:46.050> guess<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.920> trying<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> no<00:00:49.219> look<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I guess they trying to no look like a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.040 
I guess they trying to no look like a
bench<00:00:50.700> man<00:00:51.110> never<00:00:52.110> mind<00:00:52.850> for<00:00:53.850> price<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.449> about

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
bench man never mind for price of about

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
bench man never mind for price of about
twenty<00:00:55.410> twenty<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:55.829> dollars<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.329> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
twenty twenty two dollars it's it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.979 
twenty twenty two dollars it's it's
pretty<00:00:58.140> nice<00:00:58.289> knife<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.890> loved<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> 95<00:01:00.629> steel

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

never really bother with burning give it
a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.210> try<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.340> 2x4<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.420> cross<00:01:55.880> two

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a little try but 2x4 all the cross two

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
a little try but 2x4 all the cross two
inches<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> could<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:57.990> battle

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
inches you could be a good battle

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
inches you could be a good battle
very<00:01:58.890> easy<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.850> splits<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> wood<00:02:00.840> nice

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
very easy it splits the wood nice

very easy it splits the wood nice
effective<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.579> crazy<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.450> for

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
effective it's not crazy thing but for

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.459 
effective it's not crazy thing but for
the<00:02:04.229> size<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.219> nice<00:02:05.490> nice<00:02:05.880> amount<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.469> metal

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the size it's nice nice amount of metal

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
the size it's nice nice amount of metal
in<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.310> good<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.300> hollow

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
in there so that's good the hollow

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.860 
in there so that's good the hollow
ground<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.229> definitely<00:02:10.739> helps

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
ground or definitely helps

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.860 
ground or definitely helps
spreading<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.269> splitting<00:02:14.720> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
spreading the you know splitting the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.619 
spreading the you know splitting the
book<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.519> because<00:02:16.519> of<00:02:16.549> its<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.480> so

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
book and because of its because it's so

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.140 
book and because of its because it's so
high<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.620> works<00:02:18.860> very<00:02:19.069> well<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.989> softwood<00:02:21.620> its

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
high it works very well the softwood its

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.550 
high it works very well the softwood its
slices<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.330> bada<00:02:23.629> this<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.170> done<00:02:24.349> with
