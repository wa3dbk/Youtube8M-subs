00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
all right now one in this corner up you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.680 
all right now one in this corner up you
get<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.730> his<00:00:41.820> corner<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.540> early

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
get one in his corner up we get early

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.689 
get one in his corner up we get early
list<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.170> color<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:44.160> pull<00:00:44.339> up<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> then

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
list up color little pull up and then

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.670 
list up color little pull up and then
slide<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.449> see<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.659> video<00:00:45.750> slide<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
slide down so we see the video slide it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
slide down so we see the video slide it
straight<00:00:46.769> out<00:00:46.980> boom<00:00:47.399> put<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.149> inside<00:00:48.300> if

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
straight out boom put it all inside if

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.600 
straight out boom put it all inside if
you<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:49.019> better<00:00:49.229> now<00:00:49.290> there<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
you look better now there is actually a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.069 
you look better now there is actually a
little<00:00:53.610> top<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> line<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.720> you<00:00:54.780> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
little top of the line so now you can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.049 
little top of the line so now you can
socket<00:00:55.979> stick<00:00:56.159> it<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.339> there<00:00:56.460> find<00:00:56.879> out<00:00:56.970> what

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
socket stick it on there find out what

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.759 
socket stick it on there find out what
size<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.839> much<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.440> pops<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
size is it so much it pops the

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.319 
size is it so much it pops the
instrument<00:00:59.250> bit<00:00:59.430> loosen<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.180> by

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
instrument bit loosen it and do it by

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
instrument bit loosen it and do it by
hands<00:01:00.570> ops<00:01:00.719> unit<00:01:01.049> let's<00:01:01.379> fold<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.619> little<00:01:01.769> bit

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.860 

so<00:01:05.460> once<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.730> sums<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.720> ratchet

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
so once that sums it up get your ratchet

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.570 
so once that sums it up get your ratchet
set<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> nice<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.370> nice

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
set up you got it nice and in there nice

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940 
set up you got it nice and in there nice
and<00:01:08.610> snug<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> loosen<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.230> my<00:01:10.440> top<00:01:10.620> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and snug start to loosen off my top and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
and snug start to loosen off my top and
here<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.600> outlets

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
here we have it there we go outlets

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.990 
here we have it there we go outlets
where<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.410> oil<00:01:13.770> filter<00:01:14.070> worse<00:01:14.430> they've

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
doing a bland so keep a few twists in a

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.789 
doing a bland so keep a few twists in a
few<00:01:49.450> twists<00:01:49.810> fly<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:51.700> started<00:01:52.649> soon<00:01:53.649> as

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
few twists fly and get started soon as

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.870 
few twists fly and get started soon as
you<00:01:53.860> get<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.130> point<00:01:54.310> where<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.549> feel<00:01:54.729> like

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
you get to a point where you feel like

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.490 
you get to a point where you feel like
you<00:01:54.970> know<00:01:55.090> what's<00:01:55.270> obvious<00:01:56.079> it's<00:01:56.200> gonna<00:01:56.289> snap

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
you know what's obvious it's gonna snap

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.980 
you know what's obvious it's gonna snap
it<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:57.369> I'd<00:01:57.579> say<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:58.149> your<00:01:58.240> ratchet<00:01:58.360> gets

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
it then I'd say get your ratchet gets

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.660 
it then I'd say get your ratchet gets
lucky<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.439> get<00:01:59.500> its<00:01:59.649> final<00:01:59.979> few<00:02:00.100> twists<00:02:00.460> apply

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
lucky and get its final few twists apply

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.410 
lucky and get its final few twists apply
some<00:02:00.850> time<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.110> all<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.500> way<00:02:03.149> nice<00:02:04.149> and

some time do it all the way nice and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.560 
some time do it all the way nice and

legend over time now a little trick

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.780 
legend over time now a little trick
you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.470 

you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.240 

so<00:03:31.480> at<00:03:31.599> this<00:03:31.690> point<00:03:31.930> all<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.379> do<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:33.040> get<00:03:33.160> your

half<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.410> four<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:13.490> just<00:04:13.670> keep<00:04:13.850> checking

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
half to four and then just keep checking

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.000 
half to four and then just keep checking
the<00:04:14.510> levels<00:04:14.870> with<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.110> dipstick<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.770> I'm

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
the levels with the dipstick and I'm

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.289 
the levels with the dipstick and I'm
going<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.250> pull<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.430> out<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.639> ever<00:04:16.850> quick<00:04:17.090> look

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
going to pull it out and ever quick look

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.990 
going to pull it out and ever quick look
and<00:04:17.959> see<00:04:18.290> how<00:04:18.440> much<00:04:18.590> I've<00:04:18.829> got<00:04:19.040> but<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:19.700> think

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
and see how much I've got but I think

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.210 
and see how much I've got but I think
that's<00:04:20.180> spawn<00:04:20.510> yep<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.709> where<00:04:21.889> it<00:04:21.980> should<00:04:22.190> be

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
that's spawn yep so where it should be

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.500 
that's spawn yep so where it should be
it<00:04:23.090> should<00:04:23.150> always<00:04:23.510> be<00:04:24.550> in<00:04:25.550> between<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.270> top

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
it should always be in between the top

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.440 
it should always be in between the top
