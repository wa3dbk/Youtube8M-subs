diseases nurses and you're an expert
well<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.690> don't<00:00:06.899> know<00:00:06.990> about<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.529> this

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
well I don't know about that but this

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.350 
well I don't know about that but this
were<00:00:08.040> specifically<00:00:08.580> talking<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:08.940> flight

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360

now<00:00:10.110> blight<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> fungus<00:00:11.250> disease<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
now blight is a fungus disease and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.789 
now blight is a fungus disease and
airborne<00:00:12.300> fungus<00:00:12.750> disease<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.710> was

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
airborne fungus disease and it was

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.079 
airborne fungus disease and it was
actually<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> cause<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.700> Irish<00:00:14.940> potato

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
actually the cause of the Irish potato

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.189 
actually the cause of the Irish potato
famine<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:16.440> lands<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.460> leaves<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.199> you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
famine it lands on the leaves and you

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.580 
famine it lands on the leaves and you
get<00:00:20.010> brown<00:00:20.310> black<00:00:21.300> edge<00:00:21.510> spots<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> leaves

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
get brown black edge spots on the leaves

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.189 
get brown black edge spots on the leaves
and<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.220> they<00:00:23.369> slowly<00:00:23.789> increase<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.779> then

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and then they slowly increase and then

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.209 
and then they slowly increase and then
the<00:00:25.320> spores<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.859> drop<00:00:26.039> onto<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> soil<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.619> so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the spores can drop onto the soil and so

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.160 
the spores can drop onto the soil and so
what<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> spray<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.450> advance<00:00:33.899> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
what you do is you spray in advance of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.569 
what you do is you spray in advance of
having<00:00:34.469> blight<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> other<00:00:35.100> words<00:00:35.340> you've

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
having blight in other words you've

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
having blight in other words you've
sprayed<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.329> foliage<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
sprayed the foliage so that if the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.090 
sprayed the foliage so that if the
brights

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
brights

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060 
brights
blight<00:00:38.730> spores<00:00:39.149> land<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.440> take

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
blight spores land on it they don't take

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
blight spores land on it they don't take
hold<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.760> where<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> blights<00:00:42.510> voice<00:00:42.840> come

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
hold and where to the blights voice come

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
hold and where to the blights voice come
from<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.680> they're<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.309> they're<00:00:44.489> airborne

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
from well they're if they're airborne

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
from well they're if they're airborne
they're<00:00:45.210> around<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
they're around all the time but there is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.959 
they're around all the time but there is
a<00:00:46.530> particular<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.129> called<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.610> Smith's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
a particular thing called a Smith's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.540 
a particular thing called a Smith's
period<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.860> 48<00:00:50.250> hours

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
period which is if you have 48 hours

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
period which is if you have 48 hours
where<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> temperatures<00:00:51.809> above<00:00:52.110> 10<00:00:52.860> degrees

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
where the temperatures above 10 degrees

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.319 
where the temperatures above 10 degrees
centigrade<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.210> humidity<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> above<00:00:55.160> 75%

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
centigrade and the humidity is above 75%

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.520 
centigrade and the humidity is above 75%
then<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> Smith's<00:00:57.930> period<00:00:58.350> which

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
then you have a Smith's period which

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
then you have a Smith's period which
means<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> blight<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.579> likely<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.480> be

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
means the blight is likely to be

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.380 
means the blight is likely to be
prevalent<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.949> needs<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.489> humid<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
prevalent right it needs those humid so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
prevalent right it needs those humid so
that<00:01:03.570> warm<00:01:03.840> muggy<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> summer<00:01:05.430> fall<00:01:05.820> or

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that warm muggy so a summer fall or

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
that warm muggy so a summer fall or
something<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> common

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
something like that so it's a common

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.000 
something like that so it's a common
problem<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.970> date<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.360> nice<00:01:10.010> commercial
