 information in these two videos games 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.750
 but to differentiate them 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.750
 look at our barbarian 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.190

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.910
 I wish we needed 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.540
 it's a little video like that 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.710
 with them the dragon what they did 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:51.570
 far too much but did not do the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:06:02.460
 dragon in combat and strong our sense a 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:06:04.080

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.430
 with their video 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.160
 so that's all that was for my 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.810
 video was just to inform you 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.970
 like what had been the maintenance 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.660
 that we have the right to accelerate to a 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.610
 gÃ©menos gold our barracks and neutral 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.430
 extractor fans with extractors of elixir 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.930
 the more we will help if they are sick 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.910

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.260
