00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
okay what we have here is the reason why

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.330 
okay what we have here is the reason why
the<00:00:05.190> truck<00:00:05.490> stopped<00:00:06.089> working<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.660> Reverse

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
the truck stopped working in Reverse

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.080 
the truck stopped working in Reverse
this<00:00:08.340> right<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.510> reaction<00:00:09.950> Sun<00:00:11.090> gear

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this right here is the reaction Sun gear

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.890 
this right here is the reaction Sun gear
and<00:00:13.730> planet<00:00:14.730> set<00:00:15.089> from<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.139> 4l60e<00:00:16.560> transmission

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
and planet set from a 4l60e transmission

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
and planet set from a 4l60e transmission
this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.470> should<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:19.980> right

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
this is what it should look like right

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.730 
this is what it should look like right
here<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> pull<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> Sun

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
here as you can see you can pull the Sun

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
here as you can see you can pull the Sun
out<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.820> teeth<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.539> shape<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
out all the teeth are in good shape the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.230 
out all the teeth are in good shape the
packs<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.580> spin<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:29.820> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
packs in there and spin it around you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
packs in there and spin it around you
can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> gear<00:00:30.990> spinning<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.309> see

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
can see the gear spinning you can see

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.010 
can see the gear spinning you can see
the<00:00:32.700> Sun<00:00:32.969> gear<00:00:33.360> down<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> middle<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
the Sun gear down in the middle there

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.750 
the Sun gear down in the middle there
and<00:00:39.469> that's<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> should<00:00:40.800> look<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.160> this

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.799 

is<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> did<00:00:46.379> look<00:00:46.559> like

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
is actually what it did look like

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.150 
is actually what it did look like
there's<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> slop<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.710> there

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
there's a lot of slop in there

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.490 
there's a lot of slop in there
notice<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.000> doesn't<00:00:51.510> come<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.230> one

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
notice what doesn't come out on this one

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
notice what doesn't come out on this one
it's<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> glued<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> place<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> let's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it's kind of glued in place so let's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
it's kind of glued in place so let's
look<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> gears<00:00:59.030> when<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.300> spin<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
look at the gears when you spin it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.740 
look at the gears when you spin it
around<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:02.090> sometimes<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> move

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
around and sometimes they want to move

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.500 
around and sometimes they want to move
so<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.680> times<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.159> don't<00:01:05.210> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.360> look

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so other times they don't if you look

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.840 
so other times they don't if you look
down<00:01:06.720> inside<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.439> you'll<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> really

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
down inside there you'll see that really

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
down inside there you'll see that really
clean<00:01:09.270> looking<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
clean looking thing right in there that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
clean looking thing right in there that
looks<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.280> shiny<00:01:11.670> metal<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.659> actually

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
looks like shiny metal that's actually

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.649 
looks like shiny metal that's actually
the<00:01:13.350> Sun<00:01:13.619> gear<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.820> teeth<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.299> stripped

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the Sun gear all the teeth are stripped

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.490 
the Sun gear all the teeth are stripped
off<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
off of it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.429 
off of it
we<00:01:16.979> spin<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.549> around<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> see

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
we spin this thing around you can see

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
we spin this thing around you can see
the<00:01:19.560> damage<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> teeth<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:22.220> hold<00:01:23.220> over

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the damage to the teeth here I hold over

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.740 
the damage to the teeth here I hold over
my<00:01:23.549> finger<00:01:24.000> oh<00:01:28.939> there's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> good<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.360> right

my finger oh there's a good one right
there<00:01:31.049> yeah<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:34.009> we<00:01:35.009> put<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.670> way

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
there yeah and we put it over this way

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
there yeah and we put it over this way
like<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.869> needle

glued<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.070> place<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> why<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.099> truck<00:02:08.459> had

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
glued in place this is why the truck had

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.559 
glued in place this is why the truck had
no<00:02:08.700> reverse<00:02:10.160> ironically<00:02:11.160> though<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:14.040> actual

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
no reverse ironically though the actual

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.220 
no reverse ironically though the actual
ring<00:02:15.569> gear<00:02:15.870> appears<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.190> good<00:02:17.400> shape

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
ring gear appears to be in good shape

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.510 
ring gear appears to be in good shape
but<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:19.349> not<00:02:19.530> gonna<00:02:19.680> chance<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.400> gonna
