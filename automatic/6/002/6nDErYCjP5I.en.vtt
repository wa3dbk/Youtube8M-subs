the ideal is is to put this down in

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.580 
the ideal is is to put this down in
sections<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.990> no<00:01:49.290> air

bubbles you you don't want to trap any
air<00:01:51.840> bubbles<00:01:52.500> under<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:53.400> when<00:01:54.120> you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
air bubbles under this because when you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.230 
air bubbles under this because when you
heat<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.440> bring<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.890> temperature<00:01:56.580> to

heat this and bring it up temperature to
cure<00:01:58.880> you<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:02.010> heat<00:02:02.310> bubbles<00:02:02.760> will

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
cure you that the heat bubbles will

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
cure you that the heat bubbles will
cause<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> problem<00:02:05.220> they'll<00:02:05.940> start<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> come<00:02:06.570> up

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
cause a problem they'll start to come up
