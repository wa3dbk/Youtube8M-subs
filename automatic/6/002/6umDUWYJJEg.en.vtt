made<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.410> silly<00:00:50.070> mistake<00:00:50.190> whilst

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
made a bit of a silly mistake whilst

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
made a bit of a silly mistake whilst
they<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.600> start<00:00:52.250> unfortunately

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
they lost the flagship in the process I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
they lost the flagship in the process I
think<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> bite<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.100> let<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
think it's going to bite them to let a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
think it's going to bite them to let a
point<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> tournament<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.350> through

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
point in the tournament but the through
