you<00:03:14.640> know<00:03:14.850> their<00:03:15.090> size<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.750> their<00:03:16.050> capacity<00:03:16.260> I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
you know their size and their capacity I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.330 
you know their size and their capacity I
can<00:03:17.700> tell<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.300> our<00:03:19.050> line<00:03:19.560> dimension<00:03:20.190> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
can tell you that our line dimension is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.690 
can tell you that our line dimension is
smaller<00:03:20.790> than<00:03:21.060> show<00:03:21.360> me<00:03:21.600> but<00:03:22.590> our<00:03:23.250> battery

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
smaller than show me but our battery

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.240 
smaller than show me but our battery
capacity<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.570> there<00:03:25.350> their<00:03:25.650> battery<00:03:26.070> capacity

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
capacity is there their battery capacity

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.720 
capacity is there their battery capacity
is<00:03:26.610> around<00:03:26.850> 5000<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.830> are<00:03:28.980> almost<00:03:29.190> two

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
is around 5000 so we are almost two

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.690 
is around 5000 so we are almost two
times<00:03:29.910> they<00:03:30.239> show
