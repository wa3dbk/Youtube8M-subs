anyways when you slide this case on you
simply<00:04:05.320> snap<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.830> galaxy<00:04:06.220> s4<00:04:06.550> into<00:04:06.730> place<00:04:07.080> you

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
simply snap the galaxy s4 into place you

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.380 
simply snap the galaxy s4 into place you
can<00:04:08.230> slide<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:08.680> pocket<00:04:08.800> from<00:04:09.070> there

can slide it in your pocket from there

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.610 
can slide it in your pocket from there
like<00:04:10.390> all<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.630> others<00:04:10.960> it<00:04:11.170> does<00:04:11.320> have<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
like all the others it does have the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.890 
like all the others it does have the
power<00:04:11.800> cut<00:04:12.130> out<00:04:12.250> volume<00:04:12.760> as<00:04:12.880> well<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.360> then<00:04:13.780> it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
power cut out volume as well and then it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.690 
power cut out volume as well and then it
exposes<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.560> top<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:14.890> bottom<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.310> galaxy

exposes the top and bottom of the galaxy

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.690 
exposes the top and bottom of the galaxy
s4<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.840> if<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.049> drop<00:04:17.290> it<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.530> lens<00:04:17.739> directly<00:04:18.610> on

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
s4 so if you drop it in lens directly on

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.979 
s4 so if you drop it in lens directly on
the<00:04:18.760> top<00:04:18.940> at<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.090> bottom<00:04:19.360> you<00:04:19.480> will<00:04:19.510> sustain<00:04:19.840> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
the top at the bottom you will sustain a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.260 
the top at the bottom you will sustain a
little<00:04:20.230> damage<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:20.830> i<00:04:21.250> would<00:04:21.520> feel<00:04:21.700> perfectly

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
little damage but i would feel perfectly

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.450 
little damage but i would feel perfectly
safe<00:04:22.360> dropping<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:22.990> on<00:04:23.050> its<00:04:23.200> back<00:04:23.260> we<00:04:24.190> have<00:04:24.280> cut

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
safe dropping it on its back we have cut

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.770 
safe dropping it on its back we have cut
out<00:04:24.550> for<00:04:24.730> speakers<00:04:25.090> as<00:04:25.210> well<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.630> nice

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
workmate evolution case now this one's a

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.880 
workmate evolution case now this one's a
try<00:04:39.880> material<00:04:40.390> extra<00:04:40.780> protective<00:04:41.140> case<00:04:41.560> and

try material extra protective case and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.430 
try material extra protective case and
actually<00:04:42.490> comes<00:04:42.760> together<00:04:42.970> or<00:04:43.780> comes<00:04:44.110> apart

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
blue looks very nice and as I have the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.650 
blue looks very nice and as I have the
darker<00:04:50.350> samsung<00:04:50.770> galaxy<00:04:51.190> s4<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:51.910> popping<00:04:52.570> it

darker samsung galaxy s4 and popping it
into<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.900> first<00:04:53.110> layer<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:53.890> can<00:04:54.010> already<00:04:54.130> see

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
into the first layer you can already see

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.060 
into the first layer you can already see
the<00:04:54.400> color<00:04:54.760> match<00:04:55.290> so<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.350> simply<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.830> just

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
the color match so you simply do just

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.950 
the color match so you simply do just
