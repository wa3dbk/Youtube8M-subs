00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
this is perfect I will say I did make a

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.510 
this is perfect I will say I did make a
couple<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.720> changes<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.740> your<00:04:49.039> original

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
recipe I put less liquid smoke actually

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.520 
recipe I put less liquid smoke actually
did<00:04:52.669> put<00:04:53.120> two<00:04:53.390> teaspoons<00:04:53.630> we<00:04:54.229> added<00:04:54.470> a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
did put two teaspoons we added a

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.120 
did put two teaspoons we added a
teaspoon<00:04:54.740> after<00:04:55.280> we<00:04:55.400> tasting<00:04:55.789> it<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:57.500> put

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
teaspoon after we tasting it and I put

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.260 
teaspoon after we tasting it and I put
about<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.940> teaspoon<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.840> chipotle<00:05:01.270> Tabasco

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
about a teaspoon of chipotle Tabasco

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.029 
about a teaspoon of chipotle Tabasco
sauce<00:05:02.510> in<00:05:02.539> here<00:05:02.960> instead<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.710> cayenne

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
sauce in here instead of the cayenne

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.940 
sauce in here instead of the cayenne
pepper<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.780> hits<00:05:06.110> all<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.440> right<00:05:06.740> notes

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
pepper and it hits all the right notes

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.210 
pepper and it hits all the right notes
in<00:05:07.430> my<00:05:07.610> opinion<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.150> think<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.570> is<00:05:08.690> absolutely

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
in my opinion I think it is absolutely

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.029 
in my opinion I think it is absolutely
perfection<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:12.169> we're<00:05:12.320> going<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.470> do<00:05:12.710> is

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
perfection so what we're going to do is
