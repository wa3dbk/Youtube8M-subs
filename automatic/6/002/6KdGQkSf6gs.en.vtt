owner<00:00:06.899> was<00:00:07.020> having<00:00:07.440> trouble<00:00:07.799> with<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.069> 3.8

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
owner was having trouble with this 3.8

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.299 
owner was having trouble with this 3.8
liter<00:00:08.970> v6<00:00:09.510> said<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.469> wouldn't<00:00:10.679> go<00:00:10.800> over<00:00:10.830> five

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
liter v6 said it wouldn't go over five

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.700 
liter v6 said it wouldn't go over five
miles<00:00:11.639> an<00:00:11.910> hour<00:00:12.030> at<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:12.719> point<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.380> she<00:00:13.469> just

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
miles an hour at one point so she just

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.990 
miles an hour at one point so she just
stopped<00:00:13.950> driving<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.610> put<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.880> up<00:00:14.969> for

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
stopped driving it and put it up for

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.439 
stopped driving it and put it up for
sale<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.340> got<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> good<00:00:17.910> price<00:00:18.180> no<00:00:18.420> one

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
sale so we got it a good price no one

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820 
sale so we got it a good price no one
that<00:00:18.660> there's<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> mystery<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.500> our<00:00:19.619> first

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that there's a mystery but our first

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.990 
that there's a mystery but our first
thing<00:00:19.949> we're<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> check<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> coil

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
thing we're going to check is the coil

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.840 
thing we're going to check is the coil
pack<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.289> then<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.769> Ford<00:00:23.039> v6<00:00:23.490> does<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
pack and then do the Ford v6 does have a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.759 
pack and then do the Ford v6 does have a
lot<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> trouble<00:00:24.480> with<00:00:24.570> these<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:25.590> what

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
lot of trouble with these so that's what

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859 
lot of trouble with these so that's what
we're<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> test<00:00:26.279> first<00:00:26.810> it's<00:00:27.810> like

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
we're going to test first it's like

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
we're going to test first it's like
three<00:00:28.230> packs<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.090> one

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
three packs in one you got this one one

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.790 
three packs in one you got this one one
I'm<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.750> five<00:00:31.279> this<00:00:32.279> coil<00:00:32.669> pack<00:00:33.030> run<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
I'm one and five this coil pack run in

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.250 
I'm one and five this coil pack run in
two<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> six<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> third<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
two and six and then this third one is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.630 
two and six and then this third one is
running<00:00:38.040> three<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.530> four<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> set

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
running three and four I'm going to set

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
running three and four I'm going to set
this<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.079> to

this up here we're going to I'm going to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
this up here we're going to I'm going to
check<00:00:43.440> some<00:00:43.680> resistances<00:00:45.079> alright<00:00:47.239> pull<00:00:48.239> off

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
check some resistances alright pull off

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
check some resistances alright pull off
this<00:00:48.570> wire<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.860> before<00:00:50.309> we

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this wire here but first we do before we

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
this wire here but first we do before we
take<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> harness<00:00:51.329> off<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> first<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.079> over

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
take the harness off the first one over

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.729 
take the harness off the first one over
here

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
here
that's<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.789> power<00:00:54.030> wire<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> one

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that's your power wire that's the one

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
that's your power wire that's the one
you're<00:00:55.140> always<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> test<00:00:56.730> probe

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you're always going to have a test probe

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
you're always going to have a test probe
on<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> pink<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.609> first

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on then this pink one is for the first

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.080 
on then this pink one is for the first
bank<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.899> red<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> second

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
bank this red one here is for the second

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
bank this red one here is for the second
bank<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.260> white<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bank and then this white one here is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.530 
bank and then this white one here is
going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> third<00:01:05.939> bank<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> we're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
going to be for the third bank and we're

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.120 
going to be for the third bank and we're
going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> resistances<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.979> bad

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going to see if the resistances are bad

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
going to see if the resistances are bad
I<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.689> pull<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.350> supposed<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I can just pull this you're supposed to

I can just pull this you're supposed to
have<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> plastic<00:01:11.070> tab<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.180> cold

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
have a plastic tab here but it's so cold

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
have a plastic tab here but it's so cold
out<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> broke<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.380> before<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
out here I broke it before and this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
out here I broke it before and this
we're<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> lead<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:16.020> let

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we're going to get a lead on there let

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460 
we're going to get a lead on there let
me<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.890> stuff<00:01:17.100> together<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.750> then

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
me get my stuff together here and then

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.749 
me get my stuff together here and then
we're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> check<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.220> out

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we're going to check this out

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
we're going to check this out
so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> hold<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> first<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so I hold this one on the first one the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.880 
so I hold this one on the first one the
whole<00:01:23.009> time<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.290> we're<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.590> check

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
whole time and then we're going to check

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.910 
whole time and then we're going to check
Bank<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.400> let<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:29.490> stay<00:01:29.790> solid<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.479> there

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
read said anywhere from 0.8 to 1.6 but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.899 
read said anywhere from 0.8 to 1.6 but
most<00:01:43.829> people<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.189> saying<00:01:44.340> anywhere<00:01:44.729> from

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
most people are saying anywhere from

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.020 
most people are saying anywhere from
like<00:01:45.649> 0.32<00:01:47.479> tip<00:01:48.479> 1<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.649> far<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:50.100> good<00:01:50.280> now

like 0.32 tip 1 so so far we're good now

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.560 
like 0.32 tip 1 so so far we're good now
we're<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> second<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:53.240> second<00:01:54.240> ones<00:01:54.390> at

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
we're on the second one second ones at

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
we're on the second one second ones at
one<00:01:54.750> point<00:01:55.049> nine<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:56.100> point<00:01:56.369> zero<00:01:56.430> it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
one point nine one point zero it's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.929 
one point nine one point zero it's
staying<00:01:57.090> pretty<00:01:57.390> solid<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.960> still<00:01:58.530> okay<00:01:58.939> then

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
staying pretty solid at still okay then

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.190 
staying pretty solid at still okay then
we're<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> third<00:02:00.600> one<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
we're going to the third one here that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.819 
we're going to the third one here that
runs<00:02:01.409> cylinder<00:02:01.950> number<00:02:02.130> three<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.000> six<00:02:03.829> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
runs cylinder number three and six and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.630 
runs cylinder number three and six and
see<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:06.829> and<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.099> point<00:02:08.429> five

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
see what we get here and it's point five

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.530 
see what we get here and it's point five
point<00:02:09.090> three<00:02:09.209> point<00:02:09.899> 4<00:02:10.200> point<00:02:10.530> 5<00:02:10.739> 0<00:02:10.800> 3<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
point three point 4 point 5 0 3 so it's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
point three point 4 point 5 0 3 so it's
fluctuating<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.410> over

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
fluctuating all over

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
fluctuating all over
as<00:02:13.980> long<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.190> I'm<00:02:14.430> solid<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.480> it's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
as long as I'm solid on here and it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.870 
as long as I'm solid on here and it's
fluctuating<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:17.520> gonna<00:02:17.670> say

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
fluctuating like that I'm gonna say

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.680 
fluctuating like that I'm gonna say
that's<00:02:18.030> bad<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.550> I'm<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.060> these<00:02:21.180> contacts

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
that's bad I'm on I'm on these contacts

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.110 
that's bad I'm on I'm on these contacts
pretty<00:02:21.989> solid<00:02:22.470> without<00:02:22.709> shaking<00:02:23.040> his<00:02:23.849> things

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
pretty solid without shaking his things

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.880 
pretty solid without shaking his things
all<00:02:24.330> over<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.630> place<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.170> never<00:02:25.290> higher<00:02:25.620> than

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
all over the place and never higher than

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.920 
all over the place and never higher than
point<00:02:26.190> four<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.300> we're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> say<00:02:27.750> that's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
point four so we're going to say that's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.180 
point four so we're going to say that's
pretty<00:02:28.170> bad<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.650> we're<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> replace

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
pretty bad and we're going to replace

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.090 
pretty bad and we're going to replace
the<00:02:29.430> quail<00:02:29.670> however<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:31.170> had<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.350> pending<00:02:31.680> code

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the quail however we had a pending code

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.050 
the quail however we had a pending code
for<00:02:32.459> cylinder<00:02:32.790> number<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:35.310> also<00:02:35.580> had

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
for cylinder number two and we also had

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.809 
for cylinder number two and we also had
a<00:02:36.540> fault<00:02:36.930> code<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.530> cylinder<00:02:37.890> number<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.520> so

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
a fault code for cylinder number one so

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.309 
a fault code for cylinder number one so
this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.390> perplexing<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
this is a little perplexing in the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.960 
this is a little perplexing in the
disheartening<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.340> we're<00:02:41.519> definitely<00:02:41.700> going

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
disheartening but we're definitely going

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.370 
disheartening but we're definitely going
to<00:02:42.030> replace<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.540> coil<00:02:42.840> because<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.260> know

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
to replace this coil because we know

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.370 
to replace this coil because we know
it's<00:02:43.560> bad<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.069> it's<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.030> common<00:02:45.390> problem<00:02:45.599> and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
it's bad and it's a common problem and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.809 
it's bad and it's a common problem and
then<00:02:46.530> we're<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.800> see<00:02:47.040> if<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.310> car<00:02:47.519> just

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
then we're going to see if this car just

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.970 
then we're going to see if this car just
runs<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.480> together<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.560> we'll<00:02:49.830> keep

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
runs right all together and we'll keep

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.930 
runs right all together and we'll keep
you<00:02:50.040> posted<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.239> do<00:02:51.360> more<00:02:51.600> videos
