 [Music] 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 according to john ashe 2013 caradisiac with 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 pierre desjardins pierre you will us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 talk about a car that is very 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 expected that sold 3 million 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.689
 copies in its version 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 previously the screen I have a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.570
 question will be asked yes because I 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 think to have this car is called 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.920
 techno space yes it's a group of teenagers 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.090
 spaces and that's a case designer and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 I understand that it was the same 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.329
 time the new c4 picasso 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 that's exactly it's actually a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 concept car of the version that will be 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 marketed in June so in fact 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.590
 it's the future 99% c4 picasso 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.700
 we are told then right away you see 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 a little difference with the old 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.260
 which months then launched with a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.579
 a 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.449
 a lot of personalities in this 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.710
 category what was enough 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.660
 refreshing and what he did a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.800
 much of its success and this 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.909
 new generation and it's a small 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.390
 little surf is a bit in the same 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.729
 direction 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.519
 we see the different treatment of fires 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.570
 before sale pretty big optics of these 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.500
 qualifications so the problem between 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.479
 called and now we have two optics 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.250
 which are superimposed and gives a little 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.990
 more finesse a little me I find a 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.119
 little bit more aggressive this is the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.850
 probably new citroen style where we 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.590
 goes from exclusively breaks with a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 a little bit of aggression and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.539
 once again citroën in my opinion that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.869
 can renew 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.100
 the aesthetics of his small minivan and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.659
 I like it I like it 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.979
 long awaited it must surely you have 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.520
 summer 3 million this is this car 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.569
 since its first launch this is 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 we're going to take a little trip to 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.360
 interior 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.409
 yes it will take their evolution and bloody 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.590
 to be a little bit more 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.940
 small than the previous picasso c3 but 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 we are promised a skill for vitality 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.990
 habitability sata modest ie 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.220
 had a little bigger we are at 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.319
 inside this car when we 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.899
 recalls this new these four picasso 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.450
 that it's 99% in its version of the movie 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.060
 tron still has many this picasso case 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.170
 before so do not want to reveal too much 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.220
 so we do not know its price yet and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.220
 that's why it's a 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.660
 concept while it's almost done 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.769
 we find in concession inside 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.080
 we see that there is a choice of materials 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.150
 very clear for this concept car especially 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.940
 surely to showcase any 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.790
 this light that returns then after one 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.950
 can we doubt precisely this end 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.319
 not sure is in qh series on 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.000
 find the central display with this 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.270
 big screen in the middle that is not 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.060
 surprisingly I like it a lot 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.600
 all the particular aspects of 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.480
 citroën 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.610
 I am a big fan of the hub flywheel 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.050
 fixed which is less convenient but these are 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.730
 these young people the personality and I like 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
 a lot and well here we do not find one 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.760
 find it square non commercialization 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.840
 in the month of June we remind you to be 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.950
 does not recognize the land is obviously 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 the constructor puts himself in a position 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.190
 like that a little tricky since he has 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.840
 as you said dc4 dc5 to sell and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.840
 17h maybe it's also 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.520
 little bargains to do 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 soon quite yeah who 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.730
 was a good vehicle for once 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.880
 it's a lot sold so a car 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.410
 who is going to sell a lot probably 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.670
 future basin and this one is enough 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.950
 attractive is what you want to add a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.990
 word on this new c4 picasso for 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.130
 the moment called tecmo space 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.480
 I had a lot of old I like 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.320
 a lot too many new ones 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 makes you want to make a lot of kids 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.290
 here we will not let you directly 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.290
 thank you stone
