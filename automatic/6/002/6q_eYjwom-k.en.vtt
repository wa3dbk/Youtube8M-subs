cetera so let's open the box up and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.049 
cetera so let's open the box up and
check<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.540> mega<00:00:51.840> inside<00:00:52.879> which<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
check out the mega inside which is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.860 
check out the mega inside which is
definitely<00:00:54.660> mega<00:00:54.960> indeed<00:00:56.239> this<00:00:57.239> device<00:00:57.570> feels

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
definitely mega indeed this device feels

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
definitely mega indeed this device feels
colossal<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.860> my<00:00:59.010> hand<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.510> guess<00:01:00.660> that's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
colossal in my hand and I guess that's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
colossal in my hand and I guess that's
why<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.170> call<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.559> phablet<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
why they call it a phablet which if you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
why they call it a phablet which if you
don't<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.750> its<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.079> mix<00:01:04.229> between<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.650> tablet

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
don't know its a mix between a tablet

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
don't know its a mix between a tablet
and<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> phone<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> people<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.500> like

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and a phone a lot of people do like

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
and a phone a lot of people do like
phablets<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.240> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
phablets because really it's kind of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
phablets because really it's kind of the
best<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.020> both<00:01:10.110> worlds<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.220> really

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
best of both worlds you don't really

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.649 
best of both worlds you don't really
have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> worry<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:11.940> lugging<00:01:12.210> around<00:01:12.450> two

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have to worry about lugging around two

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.930 
have to worry about lugging around two
or<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.380> devices<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.280> having<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
or two different devices or having to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.300 
or two different devices or having to
remember<00:01:15.180> both<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> them<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
remember both of them it's really all in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.630 
remember both of them it's really all in
one<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.170> device<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.740> terms<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> screen

you guys that and that is right here you
just<00:02:36.150> stick<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.709> microsd<00:02:37.709> card<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.099> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
just stick the microsd card in and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.339 
just stick the microsd card in and
you're<00:02:38.340> good<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> go<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.959> obviously

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you're good to go this is obviously

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.809 
you're good to go this is obviously
where<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> battery<00:02:40.920> goes<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.430> looks<00:02:41.640> as<00:02:41.790> if

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
where the battery goes it looks as if

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.640 
where the battery goes it looks as if
another<00:02:42.180> smartphone<00:02:42.629> could<00:02:42.959> probably<00:02:43.200> fit<00:02:43.620> in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
another smartphone could probably fit in

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
another smartphone could probably fit in
there<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:44.849> big<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:46.010> I'll<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.459> give<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
there it's so big and I'll just give a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960 
there it's so big and I'll just give a
little<00:02:48.090> note<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.989> back<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.970> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
little note about the back I know it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.020 
little note about the back I know it
does<00:02:51.180> look<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.629> little<00:02:51.810> bit<00:02:52.019> flimsy<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.760> you

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
does look a little bit flimsy but as you

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.089 
does look a little bit flimsy but as you
can<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.720> does<00:02:54.900> Bend<00:02:55.260> Bend<00:02:55.739> very

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
can see it really does Bend Bend very

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.680 
can see it really does Bend Bend very
well<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.519> think<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.849> more<00:02:56.940> flexible<00:02:57.359> than

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
well and I think it's more flexible than

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050 
well and I think it's more flexible than
flimsy<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.379> don't<00:02:59.069> think<00:02:59.129> it's<00:02:59.489> going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.819> crack

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
flimsy I don't think it's going to crack

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.789 
flimsy I don't think it's going to crack
I<00:03:00.269> don't<00:03:00.420> think<00:03:00.540> anything<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.349> I

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
I don't think anything like that and I

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.170 
I don't think anything like that and I
know<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> lot<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.159> people<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.909> some

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
know a lot of people like this some

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940 
know a lot of people like this some
people<00:03:03.420> don't<00:03:03.689> they'd<00:03:03.959> rather<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.290> glass

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
people don't they'd rather a glass

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.569 
people don't they'd rather a glass
finish<00:03:05.310> or<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:06.000> matte<00:03:06.629> back<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.769> do<00:03:08.250> think

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
finish or a matte back but I do think

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.339 
finish or a matte back but I do think
that<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.909> pretty<00:03:09.060> durable<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:09.659> it's<00:03:09.810> it's

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
that it's pretty durable and it's it's

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.940 
that it's pretty durable and it's it's
not<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.709> break<00:03:12.409> it<00:03:13.409> might<00:03:13.560> take<00:03:13.799> me<00:03:13.920> a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
not going to break it might take me a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.740 
not going to break it might take me a
while<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.189> snap<00:03:14.609> back<00:03:14.639> on<00:03:15.090> though<00:03:15.329> depending

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
while to snap back on though depending

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.680 
while to snap back on though depending
on<00:03:15.900> how<00:03:16.680> many<00:03:16.739> spots<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.579> snap<00:03:18.540> it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
on how many spots you have to snap it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.180 
on how many spots you have to snap it
down<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:23.120> there<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.269> go<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.010> mega

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
down in and there we go so the mega

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.939 
down in and there we go so the mega
itself<00:03:26.639> actually<00:03:26.879> comes<00:03:27.410> loaded<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.709> lot
