00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello my good i'm very happy 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.720
 greet you on your channel and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.090
 today i want to tell you about scares 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 their hair care thing is that you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 very often ask about how i am 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.300
 I care for hair 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 but in the summer I made a video about it on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.060
 how i care for my hair oh everything 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.030
 the stages of all the procedures then I increased 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.969
 hair and basically nothing in particular 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.730
 changed except now that one of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 important problems also not a problem problem 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.590
 in hair care becomes 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.629
 disentangling my hair in order to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 hair extensions 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.360
 held on longer and better and everything was 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
 ok with him 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.559
 in fact, that's why I decided 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 make a video of my favorites 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 favorites are eye care 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 I will probably start my shampoo my 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.470
 favorite shampoo 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 so far, that is probably already almost a year 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.480
 year this is kerastase and i buy it on 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.400
 look fantastic site 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.670
 if I find a reference necessarily 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.980
 leave and to this shampoo, I always 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.610
 buy a mask from kerastase kerastase 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.520
 nutritive 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.830
 Also a reference to I will not leave very 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.720
 often there are various stocks and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.940
 discounts 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 therefore two means can be bought 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 cheaper I really like these tools 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.800
 because they are soft gentle and 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 prevent hair from being really 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.080
 really confused and become some 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.600
 naughty on the contrary they smooth 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.330
 hair beyond that if with something more 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.229
 available choose then i choose matrix 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.409
 now I only have the conditioner matrix 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.450
 This air conditioner controls smoothly with 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 restoration of hair moisturizing 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.409
 I miss because my hair 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.869
 dry i also like shampoo same 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.190
 someone gave reasons for the series 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 nose shampoo I do not have this as much as I 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.650
 alternating kerastase and matrix 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.209
 I like very much also alternate with 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.220
 means without many many large 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.170
 amount so i have them in this video 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 I decided not to show if it will be interesting 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.590
 and separately show your funds such 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.600
 more or less natural that is to also 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.870
 smoothes hair also impedes 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.420
 the formation of some such 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.160
 way in my hair so i'm very 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.140
 love these shampoos really love these 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.239
 air conditioners 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.100
 further if we talk about after after 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.769
 wash say let's go off deliveries i 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.530
 I will apply shampoo then a mask and conditioner 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.840
 I have been lately as of late 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.900
 probably already half a year can probably 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.250
 I use less such less 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 This is the revlon remedy 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.090
 name here a bunch name all names 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.160
 I will definitely sign under the video I bought 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.250
 and in a regular store as usual 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.230
 store special for just 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.690
 professional hair cosmetics 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.420
 this is our indelible conditioner 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.760
 which facilitate combing the hair then 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.410
 what again need with long hair in 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.280
 principle of short because I'm with 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.680
 combing hair 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.160
 I have problems with short hair 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.290
 because I gave a lot of hair 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.340
 very often made mistakes that is when 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.200
 brushing them wet don't do it 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.709
 at least a little dried they should 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.840
 be here is such a indelible 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.700
 he can even wear air conditioning after 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.250
 ordinary air conditioner basically nothing 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.739
 terrible will not happen than you do not 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.510
 like the fact that he really 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.190
 prevents tangling of hair and the fact that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.950
 it is very much so it did not nanesesh and 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.950
 he does not fatten hair does not and 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.290
 some so fat sloppy 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.220
 I apply them only for the whole length 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.110
 I put on the hair roots only in length and 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.500
 then when the hair is a little bit 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.450
 dry comb besides me 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.329
 I like a few more funds 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.760
 incidentally is not very expensive 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.560
 for example emulsion with effect 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.229
 lamination I already told 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.240
 out of place she likes the fact that she 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.919
 smoothes hair but effect 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.830
 lamination as such i can't 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.930
 say what i watch but here is extra 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.330
 strong fixation mirror shine to me 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.880
 I like that when I apply this emulsion 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.729
 and then I spend ironing or not even 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.490
 I spend my hair straightening and they 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.340
 hold they don't push no wind no 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.980
 there is no snow 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.470
 there is no rain 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.660
 weather, that is, this tool at the same time 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.600
 and hair spray at the same time and straighten 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.150
 for hair and at the same time but some 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.889
 The effect of such a mirror shine is 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.380
 really like very means 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.990
 she cost about 230 rubles in my not 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.020
 very expensive, I'm just in love 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.210
 Here in this here is oil elixir transfiguration 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.010
 also previously told about it from 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.280
 garnier fructis for all hair types 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.160
 argan oil for just awesome 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.600
 the thing that also provides shine 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.820
 hair that does not weigh down hair 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.870
 nourish hair for dry hair is the most 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.130
 Tols is what you really need and 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.440
 sometimes it just seems like hair 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.030
 so crushed by these dry ones 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.630
 they are straight and need to feed them 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.940
 something 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.060
 here and when i put this butter they right 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.360
 again it seems to be living on 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.160
 in fact very rich and butter 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.150
 apply quite often but by the way 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.260
 also not very expensive at all so i 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.539
 I advise you to try 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.710
 need to put a little bit quite that is 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.930
 she is economical 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.240
 so that the hair does not look 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.120
 I also do not put on fat on the tips 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.250
 I put only life I do not wear to the roots 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.440
 our only tips and two means 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.070
 I have left this is another remedy for 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.539
 matrix indelible hair cream 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.690
 heat protected this cream straightens hair 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.849
 so you can use a hairdryer 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.490
 You can use the iron and there is no 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.349
 no value he is the only one 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.360
 it is easy to overdo it with hair 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.590
 look dirty but it moisturizes 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.750
 hair 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.930
 I do not know about recovery 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.810
 they too long enough hair does 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.150
 repeat smooth something like here 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.220
 here is this emulsion but still not looking 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.169
 on the fact that he is even more expensive insuy me 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.139
 Now more like it did 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.240
 somehow more pleasing to the hair and 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:45.920
 The last is the lacquer that I buy already 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.860
 not the first time bought in different it 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.280
 species that is where there was a degree and five and 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.830
 three now stopped at degree 4 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:02.480
 it tecni.art lacquer from L'Oreal als passing 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.170
 against for strong fixing protection against moisture 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.450
 awesome exple 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:10.410
 I can advise just all of him 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:13.320
 because he keeps his hair very well 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:20.480
 he doesn't make the effect of that wasp 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:22.770
 nests or like bird nests on hair 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.450
 really protects against moisture 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.750
 Really hair holds very 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.310
