00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080 
sword that you throw at him but I have
like<00:01:52.680> unlimited<00:01:52.950> while<00:01:53.280> okay<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> need<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.939> stop

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like unlimited while okay I need to stop

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749 
like unlimited while okay I need to stop
doing<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.649> many<00:01:55.770> swords<00:01:56.100> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
doing that now I have so many swords so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.069 
doing that now I have so many swords so
I<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.600> something<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I don't know if that's something that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
I don't know if that's something that
should<00:01:58.200> probably<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.649> patched<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.969> don't

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
should probably be patched up I don't

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.730 
should probably be patched up I don't
think<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.420> supposed<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.200> but

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
think it's supposed to do that but

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
think it's supposed to do that but
you'll<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.250> throw<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> bunch<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:03.000> his<00:02:03.180> sword

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you'll just throw a bunch of his sword

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
you'll just throw a bunch of his sword
it's<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> throwing<00:02:04.530> knife<00:02:04.560> kind

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it's kind of like a throwing knife kind

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.370 
it's kind of like a throwing knife kind
of<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.000> arranged<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.719> weapon<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
of you know arranged to weapon which is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
of you know arranged to weapon which is
pretty<00:02:07.890> cool<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> I'll<00:02:08.729> pee<00:02:08.910> either

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
pretty cool not that I'll pee either

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.400 
pretty cool not that I'll pee either
minus<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.289> given<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> these<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
minus it given you all of these so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.950 
minus it given you all of these so
words<00:02:12.560> at<00:02:12.770> once<00:02:13.070> if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:14.330> find<00:02:14.630> him<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.870> you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
words at once if you find him and you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.770 
words at once if you find him and you
kill<00:02:15.260> him<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.950> could<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.030> Betty<00:02:17.270> which

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
kill him you could get the Betty which

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.950 
kill him you could get the Betty which
is<00:02:18.410> 17<00:02:19.310> attack<00:02:19.610> damage<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.690> actually

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
is 17 attack damage so it's actually

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.710 
is 17 attack damage so it's actually
stronger<00:02:21.470> than<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.310> swords<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.600> has

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
stronger than all the swords and it has

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.850 
stronger than all the swords and it has
a<00:02:23.750> cool<00:02:23.990> effect<00:02:24.080> if<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.410> right<00:02:24.560> click<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
a cool effect if you right click it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.640 
a cool effect if you right click it
it'll<00:02:25.130> strike<00:02:25.760> down<00:02:26.000> lightning<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.900> I'll<00:02:27.380> set

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it'll strike down lightning and I'll set

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.440 
it'll strike down lightning and I'll set
it<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.860> fire<00:02:27.890> while<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:28.670> breaking<00:02:29.060> everything

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
it on fire while I'm breaking everything

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.230 
it on fire while I'm breaking everything
let<00:02:29.720> me<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:29.990> put<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.260> fire<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> yeah<00:02:32.060> he

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
let me just put the fire out so yeah he

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.850 
let me just put the fire out so yeah he
sat<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.480> fire<00:02:32.750> didn't<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.110> much<00:02:33.260> damage<00:02:33.560> but

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
sat on fire didn't do much damage but

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.050 
sat on fire didn't do much damage but
now<00:02:33.980> he's<00:02:34.130> set<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.340> fire<00:02:34.580> he's<00:02:34.760> gonna<00:02:34.880> take

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
now he's set on fire he's gonna take

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.060 
now he's set on fire he's gonna take
more<00:02:35.240> damage<00:02:35.420> its<00:02:36.020> best<00:02:36.470> as<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> melee<00:02:37.010> weapon

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
more damage its best as a melee weapon

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.490 
more damage its best as a melee weapon
but<00:02:37.460> that's<00:02:37.640> still<00:02:38.030> pretty<00:02:38.240> sweet<00:02:38.720> effect

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
but that's still pretty sweet effect

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.660 
but that's still pretty sweet effect
that<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.650> could<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:39.920> strike<00:02:40.280> something

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
that you could just strike something

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.070 
that you could just strike something
down<00:02:40.820> with<00:02:40.970> lightning<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.450> strike<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.840> down

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
down with lightning I strike you down

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.230 
down with lightning I strike you down
with<00:02:42.260> lightning<00:02:42.670> pretty<00:02:43.670> accurate<00:02:44.030> too<00:02:44.060> if

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
with lightning pretty accurate too if

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.430 
with lightning pretty accurate too if
you<00:02:44.300> right-click<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.780> right<00:02:44.960> area<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
you right-click in the right area on the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.220 
you right-click in the right area on the
mob<00:02:46.210> yeah<00:02:47.210> it<00:02:47.270> probably<00:02:47.420> does<00:02:47.630> more<00:02:47.780> damage<00:02:47.810> is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
mob yeah it probably does more damage is

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
mob yeah it probably does more damage is
better<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:49.100> melee<00:02:49.520> weapon<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:49.880> he<00:02:50.060> will

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
better as a melee weapon but he will

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.450 
better as a melee weapon but he will
drop<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.660> if<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.080> decide<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.590> kill<00:02:51.800> him<00:02:51.980> but

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
drop that if you decide to kill him but

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
either and you could jump pretty high I

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.610 
either and you could jump pretty high I
wonder<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.310> could<00:03:25.370> jump<00:03:25.640> up<00:03:25.730> here<00:03:25.940> yeah<00:03:26.690> yep

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
wonder if I could jump up here yeah yep

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.460 
wonder if I could jump up here yeah yep
able<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.430> get<00:03:28.580> six<00:03:28.940> blocks<00:03:29.180> high<00:03:29.420> oh<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:30.410> took

it's<00:04:58.430> hard<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.729> be<00:04:58.910> accurate<00:04:59.300> with<00:04:59.389> this<00:04:59.570> thing

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
it's hard to be accurate with this thing

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.270 
it's hard to be accurate with this thing
but<00:05:00.289> if<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.410> throw<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.770> sword<00:05:01.039> you're<00:05:01.160> going

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
but if you throw the sword you're going

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.560 
but if you throw the sword you're going
to<00:05:01.340> lose<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.970> only<00:05:02.120> time<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.330> would

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
to lose it so the only time I would

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.659 
to lose it so the only time I would
really<00:05:02.720> use<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.139> like<00:05:03.320> for<00:05:03.560> example<00:05:04.280> you're

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
really use it is like for example you're

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.610 
really use it is like for example you're
fighting<00:05:04.970> something<00:05:05.120> right<00:05:05.539> BAM<00:05:06.229> hit<00:05:06.530> him

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
fighting something right BAM hit him

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.110 
fighting something right BAM hit him
with<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.830> sword<00:05:07.010> Oh<00:05:07.340> God<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.789> try<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> run

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
with the sword Oh God and try to run

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.629 
with the sword Oh God and try to run
away<00:05:08.150> quickly<00:05:08.650> kind<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.710> i<00:05:09.919> think<00:05:09.979> if<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.220> if

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
away quickly kind of i think if you if

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.070 
away quickly kind of i think if you if
you<00:05:10.789> hit<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:10.970> no<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.479> doesn't<00:05:11.690> come<00:05:11.780> back<00:05:11.810> like

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
you hit it no it doesn't come back like

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.779 
you hit it no it doesn't come back like
a<00:05:12.110> boomerang<00:05:12.320> it'll<00:05:13.010> just<00:05:13.160> bounce<00:05:13.280> off<00:05:13.550> them

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
a boomerang it'll just bounce off them

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.210 
a boomerang it'll just bounce off them
set<00:05:14.060> them<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.330> fire<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:15.020> deal<00:05:15.500> aight<00:05:15.800> damage

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
set them on fire and deal aight damage

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.200 
set them on fire and deal aight damage
plus<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.550> fire<00:05:16.760> damage<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.590> again<00:05:19.550> much

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
plus the fire damage and it's again much

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.900 
plus the fire damage and it's again much
better<00:05:20.449> than<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.660> diamond<00:05:21.160> sword<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.550> makes

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
better than a diamond sword and makes

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.900 
better than a diamond sword and makes
for<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.150> pretty<00:05:23.780> damn<00:05:24.020> good<00:05:24.080> melee<00:05:25.039> weapon<00:05:25.370> but

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910
