00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
okay guys I've just got a selection of

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay guys I've just got a selection of
reservoirs<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:04.220> that<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.250> thought<00:00:05.549> I'd<00:00:05.670> show

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
reservoirs here that I thought I'd show

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.039 
reservoirs here that I thought I'd show
you<00:00:09.650> okay<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.450> starting<00:00:12.450> off<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.809> one

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
you okay so starting off with this one

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.290 
you okay so starting off with this one
it's<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.440> drive<00:00:14.370> bay<00:00:14.580> reservoir<00:00:15.089> fits<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
it's a drive bay reservoir fits into a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.050 
it's a drive bay reservoir fits into a
five<00:00:18.300> point<00:00:18.539> two<00:00:18.600> five<00:00:18.900> inch<00:00:19.170> drive<00:00:19.439> bay<00:00:20.060> made

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
five point two five inch drive bay made

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.630 
five point two five inch drive bay made
by<00:00:21.240> dangered<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:23.010> use<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.519> does

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
by dangered in I have use that it does

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130 
by dangered in I have use that it does
have<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.029> bit<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> coolant<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.960> which

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
have a little bit of coolant in it which

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.689 
have a little bit of coolant in it which
makes<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.590> look<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:25.859> dirty<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.430> it's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
makes it look a bit dirty because it's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
makes it look a bit dirty because it's
red<00:00:27.330> coolant<00:00:28.939> but<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.660> new

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
red coolant but you know when it's new

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
red coolant but you know when it's new
it's<00:00:31.140> obviously<00:00:31.830> looks<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.189> lot<00:00:32.460> nicer<00:00:32.640> than

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's obviously looks a lot nicer than

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's obviously looks a lot nicer than
this<00:00:33.180> much<00:00:33.870> shinier<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.850> scratched<00:00:35.850> lists<00:00:36.860> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
this much shinier and scratched lists so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.610 
this much shinier and scratched lists so
Inlet<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> outlet<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> back<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.620> see

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
Inlet and outlet in the back there see

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.940 
Inlet and outlet in the back there see
the<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.040> holes<00:00:42.440> where<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.620> fittings

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the two holes where the fittings

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.660 
the two holes where the fittings
screwing<00:00:44.460> quarter<00:00:45.059> inch<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> divider

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
screwing quarter inch it's got a divider

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.709 
screwing quarter inch it's got a divider
there<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> middle<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.579> call<00:00:50.820> comes<00:00:51.449> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
there in the middle so the call comes in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.819 
there in the middle so the call comes in
goes<00:00:52.110> around<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.829> that's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
goes around or the other way and that's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.660 
goes around or the other way and that's
the<00:00:55.949> fill<00:00:56.190> port<00:00:57.079> okay<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.770> stage<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the fill port okay so that's stage it in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.349 
the fill port okay so that's stage it in
this<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> EK<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> EK<00:01:02.789> spin<00:01:03.180> bay

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this is EK this is the EK spin bay

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080 
this is EK this is the EK spin bay
reservoir<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:05.549> doesn't<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.850> back

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
reservoir so this one doesn't go back

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
reservoir so this one doesn't go back
anywhere<00:01:06.540> near<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.900> far<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> danger<00:01:07.920> den

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
anywhere near as far as the danger den

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.090 
anywhere near as far as the danger den
one<00:01:08.250> does<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> lot<00:01:09.720> higher<00:01:10.020> takes<00:01:10.920> up

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
one does but it's a lot higher takes up

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
one does but it's a lot higher takes up
to<00:01:12.229> five<00:01:13.229> point<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.560> five<00:01:13.979> Bay's<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:18.420> got

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to five point two five Bay's it's got

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
to five point two five Bay's it's got
four<00:01:19.580> or<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.880> inlets<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.540> outlets<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:25.549> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
four or two inlets and outlets and the

fill<00:01:26.820> port<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> top<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
fill port on the top there this is

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
fill port on the top there this is
another<00:01:29.430> drive<00:01:29.759> bay<00:01:29.970> reservoir<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.750> one's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
another drive bay reservoir this one's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
another drive bay reservoir this one's
by<00:01:31.229> bits<00:01:31.500> power<00:01:33.229> um<00:01:34.579> all<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:36.030> being

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
by bits power um all of these are being

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
by bits power um all of these are being
used<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> bit

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
used so you can see then up a bit

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100 
used so you can see then up a bit
secondhand<00:01:41.280> lots<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.299> options<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.869> back

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
secondhand lots of options in the back

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190 
secondhand lots of options in the back
there<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.680> inlets<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.130> outlets<00:01:44.899> full<00:01:45.899> port

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
there for inlets and outlets full port

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.460 
there for inlets and outlets full port
is<00:01:47.390> back<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.659> which<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is back there which is a bit of a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
is back there which is a bit of a
problem<00:01:49.680> has<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.759> fill<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
problem has when you fill it up you have

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.020 
problem has when you fill it up you have
to<00:01:51.509> pull<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.020> out

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
to pull it right out

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.190 
to pull it right out
it's<00:01:54.030> another<00:01:54.320> 5.25<00:01:55.320> bay<00:01:56.189> reservoir<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's another 5.25 bay reservoir so it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.340 
it's another 5.25 bay reservoir so it's
a<00:01:58.290> nice<00:01:58.439> small<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.240> but<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.420> i<00:02:00.600> said<00:02:00.659> pulling

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a nice small one but as i said pulling

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.950 
a nice small one but as i said pulling
it<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.829> way<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:01.979> means<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.960> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it all the way out means you have to you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.059 
it all the way out means you have to you
know<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> fill<00:02:05.159> port<00:02:05.570> if<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> poor

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
know to get to the fill port if the poor

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.540 
know to get to the fill port if the poor
three<00:02:09.069> inches<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:12.069> means<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.370> you've

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
three inches or so it means that you've

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.699 
three inches or so it means that you've
got<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.730> allow<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> bit<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.780> slack<00:02:14.019> in<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.319> tubing

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
got a allow a bit of slack in the tubing

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.920 
got a allow a bit of slack in the tubing
for<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.040> where<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.879> one<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.629> can<00:02:16.780> see

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
for that where is this one you can see

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
for that where is this one you can see
the<00:02:17.050> full<00:02:17.260> ports<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:17.739> near<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.220> edge<00:02:18.340> so

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the full ports right near the edge so

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.630 
the full ports right near the edge so
you<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.480> pull<00:02:19.690> out<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:20.140> drive<00:02:20.920> bay<00:02:21.129> cover<00:02:21.400> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you just pull out a drive bay cover to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.309 
you just pull out a drive bay cover to
fill<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.420> goes<00:02:22.629> for<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:22.989> one<00:02:23.200> as

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
fill it up and that goes for this one as

this with the ek logo in it that just

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.789 
this with the ek logo in it that just
screws<00:03:38.380> into<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.709> bottom<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:43.410> yeah<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.470> can

change<00:03:49.359> them<00:03:49.599> around<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.669> another<00:03:51.970> very

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
change them around this is another very

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.930 
change them around this is another very
small<00:03:53.079> one<00:03:53.290> by<00:03:53.530> ek<00:03:55.169> I<00:03:56.169> think<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:57.010> eighty

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
small one by ek I think it's a eighty

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.080 
small one by ek I think it's a eighty
millimeter<00:03:59.910> it's<00:04:00.910> also<00:04:01.090> smaller<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:01.870> diameter

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
millimeter it's also smaller in diameter

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.020 
millimeter it's also smaller in diameter
so<00:04:04.090> you've<00:04:04.269> got<00:04:04.480> two<00:04:04.780> at<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.349> bottom<00:04:06.030> one

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
so you've got two at the bottom one

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.780 
so you've got two at the bottom one
underneath

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
underneath

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.630 
underneath
and<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.720> one<00:04:09.959> fill<00:04:10.230> port<00:04:10.439> in<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> top<00:04:13.640> yeah

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and just one fill port in the top yeah

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.520 
and just one fill port in the top yeah
why<00:04:15.269> don't<00:04:15.329> you<00:04:15.540> use<00:04:15.720> something<00:04:15.959> like<00:04:16.079> that<00:04:16.380> if

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
why don't you use something like that if

radiator like that so yeah it bolts

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.520 
radiator like that so yeah it bolts
straight<00:05:18.240> onto<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.539> back<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.050> radiator

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
straight onto the back of the radiator
