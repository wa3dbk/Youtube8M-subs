00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.460
 this test has the objective of showing how the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 microphone determines the capture of the sound event 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.099
 according to the catchment patterns they are more directive or less directive 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.240
 this demonstration is being done with a studio microphone that is not 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.460
 external capture but as it is a microphone 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 multi-pattern 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.800
 with various catchment patterns 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.239
 it is more appropriate than this demonstration 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.019
 I am in an environment and cared for use 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.019
 purposefully to demonstrate how he will reject 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.770
 or accept only those behind the cathedral that her pain 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.560
 at the moment these microphones cab state to the standard the mini direct the tasting 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.900
 everything around him 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.620
 then see that as far as the microphone virus 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 the catchment pattern 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
 regardless of microphone position 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.330
 the video camera microphones usually have home microphones 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.480
 directional 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.000
 the downside of them is that you capture beyond what you want to capture you 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.290
 captures also 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.320
 It's alone since we warned you behind the camera on her side people start at 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.329
 camera side 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.680
 are captured as intensely as the person being 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 and being filmed 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.490
 which is the dialogue that interests you most 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.920
 So this is the microphone. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.320
 as an additional measure 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320
 and see 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.050
 the pattern of milk pick-up 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.900
 being directional man it allows the capture in all directions the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.390
 uniformly 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.159
 I do not reject society any of the directions now I will adjust this 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.159
 Microphone for cardiointerv standard 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.550
 it is on the default card and now it is now 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 look how he behaves the capture 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.569
 but the ana cup 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.459
 is that it is greatly reduced alongside also 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.549
 she 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.650
 is also reduced but when we are in front of the capsule the captation 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.309
 it's much sharper 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.529
 see again 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:30.520
 next to 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.610
 capturing circles my home cycling 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.049
 with that we reject 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.229
 the captation 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.329
 sound the unwanted ones behind the microphone 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.639
 with this we reject in the capture the sound the unwanted who are behind the 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.599
 microphone so I'm going to change the pickup pattern now to bidirectional 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.109
 with this pattern the two sides of the captive are capturing at the same time but each 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.339
 one of them with a standard card and hyde 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.739
 this is the last studies when you want to record a group of people with the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.260
 dialogue between two people 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.169
 using only one microphone 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.049
 no because 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.009
 he is known in the studio 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.680
 is that the more microphones its use 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.710
 is more problems can occur then in a recording of a dialogue by 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.780
 example the use of a single bi-directional microphone solves many problems 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.409
 and simplifies the whole process 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.409
 let's now go for bidirectional 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.169
 with this pattern 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.049
 I have a cardiol to India that in front of the microphone and another one here 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:31.870
 behind 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.340
 and I kill very significant reduction on the sides so see what happened 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.909
 I'm turning 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.149
 are cyclical 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.069
 to the extent that there is a little more it returns 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.089
 I'm picking up with the phase to bring the capsule 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.889
 then it returns easily with the 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.549
 then the capsule is made to receive 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.819
 is a certain positive pulse 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.030
 is in one of the phases and generate a boost of a positive year 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.160
 this capture that is with farm and had but a port electric signal goes 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.539
 produce something in the same way 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.819
 so I can have a person talking distilled into the microphone 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.039
 and another talking from this other side when we turn microphone 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.159
 the sound of the muppets appearance 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.870
 This is very useful as I said in studios, right? 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.090
 even in the front the capture is clear 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.419
 on the sides she will continue to chase 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.979
 already behind it returns even with facility da but returns ne 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.559
 after appearing 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.619
 let's see if this behavior in other microphones
