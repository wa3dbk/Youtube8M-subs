00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.030
 hello everyone in this tutorial 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.330
 we will need 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.990
 enamel orange or color that a 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.990
 you like it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.240
 enamel black 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.670
 white enamel 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 and a top coat means that it is the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.910
 protector for your enamel so you do not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.230
 I will mistreat you 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.230
 the design that we will do 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.949
 we started to apply two layers of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.230
 color glaze that you like in 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.860
 this case we will apply enamel 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 orange 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.010
 and wait for it to dry before 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 work our nail 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.850
 having already applied the two layers of 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.130
 Tomas enamel to put a layer of 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.130
 white enamel on the tip of your nails 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.600
 this improves the part in front of the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.600
 tennis 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.610
 and we wait for it to dry 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:53.380
 they had dried orange enamel and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.130
 your white enamel let's go over everything 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 the white shore with colored enamel 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 black 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.250
 and this will be the opposite of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.290
 our wines 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.760
 it does not matter if you're always wrong 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.760
 you can address a little 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.040
 in this part you have to have a lot 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.110
 patience so you do not go to 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 wrong 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.920
 then later we continue to put 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.629
 three little dots on this side and three 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.859
 little dots on this side that is where 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.859
 our ribbons will come out 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.400
 you have to wait for it to dry a bit 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.850
 to be able to handle our enamel 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.850
 White 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.439
 having already taken out our black enamel 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.840
 we will proceed to put our enamel 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.560
 white to make the ribbon of our 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.980
 issues let's start by joining the part of 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 down 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.280
 and then we make a figure in the form of 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.280
 X 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.390
 and to finish another figure in the form of 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.390
 X 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.590
 and so you already have your tennis I hope you have
