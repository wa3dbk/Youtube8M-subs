00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.680 
the overclocking widget but I like this
one<00:04:02.049> better<00:04:02.380> because<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.450> can<00:04:04.480> make<00:04:05.440> profiles

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
one better because you can make profiles

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.390

like<00:04:07.690> when<00:04:07.930> it's<00:04:08.080> charging<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.739> have<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.100> maxed

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
like when it's charging I have it maxed

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.250 
like when it's charging I have it maxed
out<00:04:09.580> once<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.060> sleep<00:04:10.299> or<00:04:10.420> standby<00:04:10.600> it's<00:04:11.110> at

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
out once and sleep or standby it's at

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.309 
out once and sleep or standby it's at
the<00:04:11.350> minimum<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.980> maximum<00:04:12.030> for<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.319> process

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
the minimum and maximum for the process

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.500 
the minimum and maximum for the process
and<00:04:14.530> then<00:04:14.650> once<00:04:14.830> plugged<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.359> my

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
and then once plugged in I have it my

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.729 
and then once plugged in I have it my
style<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:19.079> think<00:04:20.079> that's<00:04:20.229> going<00:04:20.410> then<00:04:20.650> you

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
style but I think that's going then you

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.860 
style but I think that's going then you
can<00:04:20.859> have<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:20.979> little<00:04:21.130> widget<00:04:21.370> right<00:04:21.609> here<00:04:21.940> and

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
can have a little widget right here and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.940 
can have a little widget right here and
this<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.140> works<00:04:23.350> better<00:04:23.590> than<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
this one works better than the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:32.530 
this one works better than the
overclocking<00:04:24.610> widget<00:04:26.280> context

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540
