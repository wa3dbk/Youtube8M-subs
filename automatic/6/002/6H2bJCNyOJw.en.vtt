00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello youtube friends we are truck and the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.700
 purpose is to represent a tutorial of how 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.849
 program your smart card 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.849
 nfc in an lg optimus l 5 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.810
 Well the first thing that I should tell you is 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.490
 that the nfc smart card comes 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.420
 included totally free with the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.790
 mobile and for example I do not know in the case 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.539
 of lg but in the case of sony you can 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.390
 buy in packs of 3 for 10 euros 15 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.460
 as much and good let's start with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 the first tutorial I would have to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 to do is unblock the group's mobile 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.220
 to make it better we block them 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 to applications and we look for this app that 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.479
 comes already installed on the phone there is no 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 to install it or anything called the 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.780
 axis tag plus and comes with the symbol of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.760
 nfc 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 let's go into it and good to me 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 I would have to leave first this 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 tell you what is good put in car mode 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 mo office user rest but say that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.350
 you can write in four 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.080
 quietly and make the four 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 be user mode then we're not going to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 teach us to program this that we are of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.799
 user but knowing how to program this 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.310
 you know how to program the rest so let's go 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.640
 to give 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 we are going to for example to program the gps 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.759
 to activate when we turn it on 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 and the application we're going to put that 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.409
 activate youtube for example 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.200
 let's go here the last one and it would be to write in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 the label now we take the mobile 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.229
 we get the card and put pietro in 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 the label then now let's go out 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.230
 outside without blocking to check that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.040
 it is truly written 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.040
 we encourage him 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.909
 and youtube turns on but does not load 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.000
 because I have internet disabled then 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.189
 it would not look like it works then for 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.350
 delete the good user mode for 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.899
 deactivate it first we give here 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.689
 the red button and we put it back 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.269
 and it tells us that the user mode is already 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.769
 activated deactivating the users we are going to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.500
 to accept 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:24.260
 let's go again to apps and again to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.799
 axis tag and good we go back 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.799
 good 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.350
 and you see the gummie does not delete the user 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.630
 delete the rest the user leaves it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.960
 so you can see 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.510
 there it is deleted but as you see 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.170
 this is still active to erase it from there 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.760
 to give everything and today it is erased and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.770
 now let's write the label and now 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.740
 is your schedule 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.900
