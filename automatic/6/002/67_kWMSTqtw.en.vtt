health with its attack and attack speed

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.180 
health with its attack and attack speed
are<00:00:17.390> actually<00:00:17.750> pretty<00:00:17.900> good<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.860> health<00:00:19.039> is

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
are actually pretty good the health is

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.160 
are actually pretty good the health is
on<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.430> lackluster<00:00:19.760> side<00:00:20.270> but<00:00:20.720> all<00:00:20.810> around<00:00:21.050> he

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
on the lackluster side but all around he

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.689 
on the lackluster side but all around he
is<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.320> pretty<00:00:21.680> formidable<00:00:22.070> opponent<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:22.609> do

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
is a pretty formidable opponent we do

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.370 
is a pretty formidable opponent we do
have<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.910> male<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:23.390> female<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:24.199> male

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
have the male and the female so the male

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.050 
have the male and the female so the male
as<00:00:24.590> you<00:00:24.650> can<00:00:24.740> see<00:00:24.890> is<00:00:25.100> have<00:00:25.580> quite<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.820> high

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
as you can see is have quite a high

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.970 
as you can see is have quite a high
attack<00:00:26.359> speed<00:00:26.420> but<00:00:27.230> now<00:00:27.350> let's<00:00:27.560> get<00:00:27.650> over<00:00:27.859> to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
attack speed but now let's get over to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.500 
attack speed but now let's get over to
the<00:00:28.100> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:28.760> Rex<00:00:29.029> let's<00:00:29.210> throw<00:00:29.420> this

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
the Tyrannosaurus Rex let's throw this

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.120 
the Tyrannosaurus Rex let's throw this
guy<00:00:29.660> down<00:00:29.840> over<00:00:30.050> here<00:00:30.230> because<00:00:30.619> we<00:00:30.740> don't<00:00:30.949> want

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
guy down over here because we don't want

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.639 
guy down over here because we don't want
any<00:00:31.310> impromptu<00:00:32.059> fights<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.229> over<00:00:33.440> on<00:00:33.530> this

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
any impromptu fights so over on this

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.439 
any impromptu fights so over on this
side<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:33.859> do<00:00:34.129> have<00:00:34.159> the<00:00:34.370> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:35.120> Rex

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
side we do have the Tyrannosaurus Rex

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.200 
side we do have the Tyrannosaurus Rex
and<00:00:35.629> it<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.929> a<00:00:36.139> towering<00:00:36.979> over<00:00:37.639> these<00:00:37.819> two

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
and it is a towering over these two

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.329 
and it is a towering over these two
other<00:00:38.359> carnotaurs<00:00:38.870> right<00:00:39.559> here<00:00:39.799> as<00:00:39.979> you<00:00:40.190> could

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
other carnotaurs right here as you could

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.160 
other carnotaurs right here as you could
tell<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:40.940> if<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.089> do<00:00:41.210> check<00:00:41.389> his<00:00:41.539> status<00:00:41.780> have

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
tell so if you do check his status have

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.869 
tell so if you do check his status have
a<00:00:42.289> very<00:00:42.679> high<00:00:42.889> health<00:00:43.100> snap<00:00:43.339> but<00:00:43.519> its<00:00:43.639> attacks

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
a very high health snap but its attacks

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.539 
a very high health snap but its attacks
that<00:00:44.149> is<00:00:44.329> actually<00:00:44.690> merely<00:00:45.079> double<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.309> it's

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
that is actually merely double so it's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.099 
that is actually merely double so it's
actually<00:00:46.819> you<00:00:47.149> know<00:00:47.179> two<00:00:47.420> Carnotaurus<00:00:47.899> with

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
actually you know two Carnotaurus with

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.719 
actually you know two Carnotaurus with
their<00:00:48.260> higher<00:00:48.440> attack<00:00:48.799> speed<00:00:49.069> could<00:00:49.399> probably

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
their higher attack speed could probably

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.910 
their higher attack speed could probably
do<00:00:50.059> quite<00:00:50.089> a<00:00:50.420> bit<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.659> damage<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:50.959> this<00:00:51.139> guy<00:00:51.319> but

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
do quite a bit of damage to this guy but

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.500 
do quite a bit of damage to this guy but
what<00:00:52.369> I<00:00:52.399> want<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.670> guys<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.819> do<00:00:53.030> right<00:00:53.179> now<00:00:53.329> is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
what I want you guys to do right now is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.000 
what I want you guys to do right now is

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
way I had to do this battle between the

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.469 
way I had to do this battle between the
Carnotaurus<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.429> the<00:01:16.579> Tyrannosaurus<00:01:16.759> Rex<00:01:17.359> is

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
Carnotaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.149 
Carnotaurus and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is
I<00:01:17.600> have<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> team<00:01:18.079> the<00:01:18.289> Carnotaurus<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.039> make

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
I have a team the Carnotaurus and make

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.980 
I have a team the Carnotaurus and make
sure<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.310> own<00:01:19.700> them<00:01:19.969> then<00:01:20.390> I'll<00:01:20.539> place<00:01:20.750> down<00:01:20.960> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
sure I own them then I'll place down a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.810 
sure I own them then I'll place down a
t-rex<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.560> hit<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.859> t-rex<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.369> both<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.700> them

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
t-rex and hit the t-rex and both of them

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.639 
t-rex and hit the t-rex and both of them
should<00:01:23.149> run<00:01:23.479> at<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:23.810> if<00:01:23.960> they<00:01:24.320> are<00:01:24.350> close

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
should run at it if they are close

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.870 
should run at it if they are close
enough<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:25.250> let's<00:01:25.369> try<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.579> make<00:01:25.670> sure<00:01:25.789> these

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
enough so let's try to make sure these

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.399 
enough so let's try to make sure these
guys<00:01:25.939> are<00:01:26.090> relatively<00:01:26.780> close<00:01:26.899> together<00:01:27.229> we

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
guys are relatively close together we

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.929 
guys are relatively close together we
could<00:01:27.530> place<00:01:27.710> down<00:01:27.920> our<00:01:28.130> one<00:01:28.340> Tyrannosaurus

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
could place down our one Tyrannosaurus

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.609 
could place down our one Tyrannosaurus
Rex<00:01:29.179> now<00:01:29.329> I<00:01:29.539> think<00:01:29.899> they're<00:01:30.020> going<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.409> pig

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
Rex now I think they're going for a pig

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.069 
Rex now I think they're going for a pig
right<00:01:30.829> now<00:01:30.979> so

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
right now so

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.669 
right now so
I<00:01:33.079> don't<00:01:33.200> know<00:01:33.259> where<00:01:33.380> they're<00:01:33.499> going<00:01:33.530> with

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
I don't know where they're going with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.010 
I don't know where they're going with
this<00:01:33.740> one<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.280> male<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:34.999> the<00:01:35.090> male<00:01:35.270> he<00:01:35.899> is

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
this one the male this is the male he is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.319 
this one the male this is the male he is
definitely<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.560> bit<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.850> bit<00:01:37.880> more

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
definitely a bit it's a bit more

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.749 
definitely a bit it's a bit more
aggressive<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.409> does<00:01:39.560> appear<00:01:39.829> like<00:01:40.039> he<00:01:40.219> does

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
aggressive it does appear like he does

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.819 
aggressive it does appear like he does
seem<00:01:40.969> to<00:01:40.999> go<00:01:41.630> after<00:01:41.899> pigs<00:01:42.079> a<00:01:42.229> lot<00:01:42.380> more<00:01:42.560> often

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
seem to go after pigs a lot more often

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.620 
seem to go after pigs a lot more often
which<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.100> guess<00:01:43.219> is<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.399> be<00:01:43.490> expected<00:01:43.759> with

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
which I guess is to be expected with

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.230 
which I guess is to be expected with
some<00:01:44.810> dinosaurs<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.369> if<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.939> female

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
some dinosaurs so if you get the female

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.090 
some dinosaurs so if you get the female
off<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.659> wall<00:01:47.869> really<00:01:48.109> quickly<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.920> think

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
off the wall really quickly and I think

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.200 
off the wall really quickly and I think
I'm<00:01:49.159> going<00:01:49.249> to<00:01:49.340> place<00:01:49.490> down<00:01:49.640> Tyrannosaurus

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
I'm going to place down Tyrannosaurus

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.899 
I'm going to place down Tyrannosaurus
Rex<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.630> just<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.259> moment<00:01:51.679> stop<00:01:52.460> riding<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
Rex in just a moment stop riding it to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.880 
Rex in just a moment stop riding it to
the<00:01:52.999> wall<00:01:53.210> female<00:01:53.659> she<00:01:53.869> always<00:01:54.350> does<00:01:54.590> this

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the wall female she always does this

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.559 
the wall female she always does this
I<00:01:54.920> don't<00:01:55.249> know<00:01:55.310> why<00:01:55.490> all<00:01:55.969> right<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:56.329> let's

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
I don't know why all right so let's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.389 
I don't know why all right so let's
let's<00:01:57.049> not<00:01:57.079> go<00:01:57.350> for<00:01:57.530> those<00:01:57.649> pigs<00:01:57.859> anymore<00:01:58.039> as

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
let's not go for those pigs anymore as

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.059 
let's not go for those pigs anymore as
you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.579> see<00:01:58.700> my<00:01:58.819> first<00:01:58.969> test<00:01:59.389> test<00:02:00.170> results

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
you can see my first test test results

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.830 
you can see my first test test results
right<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:01.579> there's<00:02:02.179> some<00:02:02.359> meat<00:02:02.539> on<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
right there there's some meat on the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
right there there's some meat on the
ground<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.259> didn't<00:02:03.889> go<00:02:04.039> as<00:02:04.189> well<00:02:04.369> as<00:02:04.429> you'd

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
ground it didn't go as well as you'd

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.709 
ground it didn't go as well as you'd
think<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.060> guess<00:02:05.210> I'll<00:02:05.299> just<00:02:05.359> place<00:02:05.600> this

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
think so I guess I'll just place this

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.599 
think so I guess I'll just place this
guy<00:02:05.810> right<00:02:06.049> here<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:06.289> in<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.219> middle<00:02:07.429> of<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
guy right here and in the middle of the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.339 
guy right here and in the middle of the
two<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:08.060> as<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.840> can<00:02:08.989> see<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.009> go<00:02:10.220> oh

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
two and as you can see here we go oh

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.080 
two and as you can see here we go oh
this<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.530> bad<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.010> try<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.489> Carnotaurus<00:02:13.909> is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this is bad the try that Carnotaurus is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.710 
this is bad the try that Carnotaurus is
not<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.480> great

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
not in a great

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.570 
not in a great
spot<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.620> then<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.860> hit<00:02:16.010> them<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:16.400> both

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
spot and then to hit them and then both

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.620 
spot and then to hit them and then both
of<00:02:16.700> them<00:02:16.820> should<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.060> in<00:02:17.300> right<00:02:17.450> now<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
of them should go in right now the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
as well and let's see so they are all

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000 
as well and let's see so they are all
moving<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.989> DEM<00:03:24.170> right<00:03:24.380> now<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.739> you

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
moving in on the DEM right now as you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.500 
moving in on the DEM right now as you
can<00:03:25.070> see<00:03:25.220> they<00:03:25.340> are<00:03:25.370> gangbanging<00:03:26.060> up<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.360> one

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
can see they are gangbanging up on one

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.910 
can see they are gangbanging up on one
this<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.780> their<00:03:26.900> best<00:03:27.110> chance<00:03:27.230> right<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:27.650> is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
this is their best chance right here is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.949 
this is their best chance right here is
to<00:03:28.220> take<00:03:28.370> out<00:03:28.550> one<00:03:28.790> at<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.000> time<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.390> oh<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:29.900> you

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
to take out one at a time and oh as you

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.810 
to take out one at a time and oh as you
can<00:03:30.140> see<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.560> did<00:03:30.769> take<00:03:30.920> down<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.370> one<00:03:31.580> it

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
can see they did take down the one it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.400 
can see they did take down the one it
looks<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.209> there<00:03:32.360> are<00:03:32.390> three<00:03:32.540> Carnotaurus

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
looks like there are three Carnotaurus

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.259 
looks like there are three Carnotaurus
remaining<00:03:33.920> all<00:03:34.100> at<00:03:34.280> full<00:03:34.489> HP<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.180> is

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
remaining all at full HP so this is

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.880 
remaining all at full HP so this is
going<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.450> be<00:03:35.540> an<00:03:35.600> interesting<00:03:35.780> battle<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.380> I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
going to be an interesting battle and I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.520 
going to be an interesting battle and I
think<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.310> don't<00:03:37.670> oh<00:03:37.790> oh<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:39.019> t-rex<00:03:39.380> is

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
think I don't oh oh this t-rex is

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.690 
think I don't oh oh this t-rex is
actually<00:03:39.830> taking<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> little<00:03:40.220> nap<00:03:40.430> right<00:03:40.459> now

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
actually taking a little nap right now

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.280 
actually taking a little nap right now
so<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.390> could<00:03:41.570> be<00:03:41.600> our<00:03:41.660> best<00:03:41.959> bet

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
so this could be our best bet

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.570 
so this could be our best bet
Oh<00:03:42.440> as<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.769> can<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.250> them<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.489> moving

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
Oh as you can see one of them is moving

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.300 
Oh as you can see one of them is moving
only<00:03:44.239> what<00:03:44.799> maybe

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
only what maybe

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.339 
only what maybe
I<00:03:46.370> don't<00:03:47.209> know<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.300> don't<00:03:47.540> think<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.720> female<00:03:48.110> is

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
I don't know I don't think the female is

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.270 
I don't know I don't think the female is
paying<00:03:48.530> attention<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:48.860> I'm<00:03:48.950> gonna<00:03:49.069> hit<00:03:49.190> him

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
paying attention so I'm gonna hit him

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.650 
paying attention so I'm gonna hit him
one<00:03:49.430> more<00:03:49.580> time<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.209> we'll<00:03:50.330> see<00:03:50.450> what<00:03:50.569> happens

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
one more time and we'll see what happens

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.160 
one more time and we'll see what happens
here

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
here

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.479 
here
it<00:03:51.380> looks<00:03:51.530> like<00:03:51.620> two<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.770> them<00:03:51.980> are<00:03:52.069> moving<00:03:52.340> in

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
it looks like two of them are moving in

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.280 
it looks like two of them are moving in
so<00:03:52.880> let's<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.180> where<00:03:53.599> gets<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.900> first<00:03:54.080> bite

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
so let's see where gets the first bite

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.470 
so let's see where gets the first bite
off<00:03:54.440> will<00:03:54.709> do<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.250> most<00:03:55.340> oh<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.180> t-rex

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
off will do the most oh the t-rex

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.470 
off will do the most oh the t-rex
decides<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.290> roar<00:03:57.590> at<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:58.190> moment<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:59.360> it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
decides to it roar at that moment so it

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.250 
decides to it roar at that moment so it
looks<00:03:59.630> like<00:03:59.780> oh<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.819> Tyrannosaurus<00:04:01.819> Rex

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260
