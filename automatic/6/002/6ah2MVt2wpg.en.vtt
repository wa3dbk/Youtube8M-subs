this is true of all Gaucho knots or

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.120 
this is true of all Gaucho knots or
excuse<00:01:16.860> me

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.240 

okay<00:01:46.700> following<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> part<00:01:48.780> behind<00:01:49.230> us<00:01:49.440> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
okay following the part behind us this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.530 
okay following the part behind us this
is<00:01:50.310> where<00:01:50.550> our<00:01:50.610> standing<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.060> came<00:01:51.330> through

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
is where our standing in came through

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.970 
is where our standing in came through
before<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:54.200> over<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:56.660> under<00:01:57.660> one<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.050> then

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
before so over one under one and then

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.580 
before so over one under one and then
over<00:01:59.280> those<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.880> exit<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> knot<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
over those two to exit the knot and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.480 
over those two to exit the knot and
again<00:02:04.980> I'm<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.340> fan<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:07.310> follow<00:02:08.310> this

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
again I'm not a fan of the follow this

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.330 
again I'm not a fan of the follow this
exact<00:02:08.910> step-by-step<00:02:09.479> procedure<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.530> over<00:02:11.130> 1

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
exact step-by-step procedure of over 1

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.740 
exact step-by-step procedure of over 1
under<00:02:11.880> 2<00:02:12.060> over<00:02:12.780> 2<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.070> on<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.430> forth

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
under 2 over 2 and so on and so forth

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.030 
under 2 over 2 and so on and so forth
it's<00:02:15.750> about<00:02:15.990> knowing<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.410> flow<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.860> knot

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it's about knowing the flow of the knot

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.270 
it's about knowing the flow of the knot
so<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.180> you're<00:02:18.720> forming<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> pair<00:02:19.350> form<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.040> pair

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
so if you're forming a pair form a pair

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.460 
so if you're forming a pair form a pair
if<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:21.570> splitting<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.960> pair<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> split<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
if you're splitting a pair of split a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.850 
if you're splitting a pair of split a
pair<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.630> these<00:02:25.200> simple<00:02:25.650> rules

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
pair and just know these simple rules

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:34.910 
pair and just know these simple rules
for<00:02:26.010> Gaucho<00:02:26.550> knots<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:28.040> exiting<00:02:29.040> over<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:33.920> get

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
for Gaucho knots are exiting over to get

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.320 
for Gaucho knots are exiting over to get
the<00:02:34.950> twists<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:35.670> line<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.180> real

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the twists out of my line here real

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.400 
the twists out of my line here real
quick<00:02:36.570> ok

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
quick ok

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
so over to back into the knot this way

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.400 
so over to back into the knot this way
and<00:02:43.290> form<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.340> next<00:02:44.640> pair<00:02:45.320> following<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
and form this next pair following the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.800 
and form this next pair following the
one<00:02:46.560> behind<00:02:46.740> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:05.100 

ok<00:02:54.810> exiting<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.800> knot<00:02:55.950> over<00:02:56.280> to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.350 

back<00:03:05.710> into<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.220> we're<00:03:06.610> about<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.060> hit<00:03:07.240> our

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
back into it we're about to hit our

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.360 
back into it we're about to hit our
first<00:03:07.390> pair

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.470 

okay<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.459> why<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.610> said<00:03:20.849> split<00:03:21.180> perish

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
okay so this is why I said split perish

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.210 
okay so this is why I said split perish
as<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.690> come<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.050> them<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.349> over<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> exit<00:03:23.099> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
as you come to them and over to exit the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.869 
as you come to them and over to exit the
knot<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.720> going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> continue<00:03:25.440> our

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
knot so we're going to continue our

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.750 
knot so we're going to continue our
over-and-under<00:03:26.959> sequence<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.950> all<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.640> got

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
over-and-under sequence and all you got

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.790 
over-and-under sequence and all you got
to<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.090> look<00:03:30.269> at<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> knot<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.379> figure<00:03:31.650> out

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
to do is look at the knot to figure out

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.580 
to do is look at the knot to figure out
how<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.040> split<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.610> pair<00:03:32.879> in<00:03:33.810> order<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.230> exit

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
how to split this pair in order to exit

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.789 
how to split this pair in order to exit
the<00:03:34.620> not<00:03:34.860> going<00:03:35.610> over<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.390> need<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.349> go<00:03:37.470> under

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
the not going over to I need to go under

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.630 
the not going over to I need to go under
to<00:03:37.980> here<00:03:39.440> just<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.239> okay<00:03:43.489> you're<00:03:44.489> going

to here just like so okay you're going

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.089 
to here just like so okay you're going
to<00:03:44.760> see<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.060> pattern<00:03:45.330> repeated<00:03:45.959> over<00:03:46.560> and

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
to see this pattern repeated over and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.470 
to see this pattern repeated over and
over<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.849> over<00:03:48.090> again<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:49.080> knot<00:03:50.480> that's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
over and over again and this knot that's

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.110 
over and over again and this knot that's
really<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.110> simple<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.730> looks

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
really as simple as it is it looks

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.479 
really as simple as it is it looks
complex<00:03:54.630> but<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.739> really<00:03:55.920> not<00:04:01.190> okay<00:04:02.190> so

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
complex but it's really not okay so

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.479 
complex but it's really not okay so
going<00:04:02.790> over<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.420> exit<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:04.489> coming

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
going over to to exit the not coming

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:14.160 
going over to to exit the not coming
back<00:04:05.610> into<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> knot

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.050 

see<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:14.800> is<00:04:14.980> why<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.160> keep<00:04:15.340> on<00:04:15.520> twisting<00:04:15.970> it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
see this is why I keep on twisting it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.160 
see this is why I keep on twisting it
that's<00:04:16.239> what<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.480> looks<00:04:16.630> like<00:04:16.750> when<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.019> get<00:04:17.109> a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
that's what it looks like when you get a

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.380 
that's what it looks like when you get a
twist<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.709> you're<00:04:17.799> not<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.910> looks<00:04:19.030> kind<00:04:19.329> of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
twist and you're not it looks kind of

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.890 
twist and you're not it looks kind of
goofy<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.530> don't<00:04:21.070> like<00:04:21.220> it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
goofy I don't like it

goofy I don't like it
anyhow<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.950> order<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.370> exit<00:04:24.730> this<00:04:24.850> over<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.630> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
anyhow in order to exit this over to I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.070 
anyhow in order to exit this over to I
need<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.650> go<00:04:26.830> under<00:04:27.160> these<00:04:27.310> two<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:28.660> split<00:04:28.900> this

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
need to go under these two to split this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.520 
need to go under these two to split this
pair

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
their not this is that repetition I was

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.159 
their not this is that repetition I was
talking<00:05:38.150> about<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.509> see<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.840> same<00:05:39.110> pattern

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169

pair of there it's really simple come
back<00:06:04.789> into<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.150> knot<00:06:06.159> because<00:06:07.159> this<00:06:07.340> is

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
back into the knot because this is

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.249 
back into the knot because this is
there's<00:06:07.880> no<00:06:08.000> pair<00:06:08.240> here<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:08.780> it's<00:06:08.900> still<00:06:09.110> over

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
there's no pair here so it's still over

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:16.540 
there's no pair here so it's still over
101<00:06:12.639> then<00:06:14.259> take<00:06:15.259> a<00:06:15.289> look<00:06:15.560> at<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:16.039> sequence

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
101 then take a look at the sequence

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.180 
101 then take a look at the sequence
here<00:06:17.080> in<00:06:18.080> order<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:18.770> exit<00:06:19.250> going<00:06:20.060> over<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.509> and

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
here in order to exit going over to and

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.119 
here in order to exit going over to and
split<00:06:22.190> both<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.610> these<00:06:22.729> pairs<00:06:23.150> I<00:06:23.830> need<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:24.949> go

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
split both of these pairs I need to go

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.200 
split both of these pairs I need to go
over<00:06:25.789> these<00:06:26.300> two<00:06:26.629> and<00:06:27.729> split<00:06:28.729> this<00:06:28.940> pair<00:06:29.180> right

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
over these two and split this pair right

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.640 
over these two and split this pair right
here<00:06:30.039> then<00:06:31.039> under<00:06:31.520> these<00:06:31.699> two<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.620> split<00:06:33.620> that

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
here then under these two and split that

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.790 
here then under these two and split that
pair<00:06:34.099> and<00:06:34.370> then<00:06:35.210> exit<00:06:35.659> over<00:06:36.199> these<00:06:36.409> two<00:06:37.599> okay

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
pair and then exit over these two okay

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.779 
pair and then exit over these two okay
you're<00:06:39.800> going<00:06:39.919> to<00:06:40.009> see<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.340> pattern<00:06:40.729> a

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
you're going to see this pattern a

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.760 
you're going to see this pattern a
couple<00:06:41.090> of<00:06:41.150> times<00:06:41.360> around<00:06:42.729> until<00:06:43.729> we<00:06:43.759> get<00:06:44.000> to

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
couple of times around until we get to

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.360 
couple of times around until we get to
three<00:06:45.770> pairs<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:48.380> can<00:06:48.440> already<00:06:48.800> see<00:06:49.130> the

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
three pairs you can already see the

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.189 
three pairs you can already see the
pattern<00:06:49.969> starting<00:06:50.449> to<00:06:50.569> form<00:06:50.810> that's<00:06:50.990> like

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
pattern starting to form that's like

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.249 
pattern starting to form that's like
Gaucho<00:06:51.440> weave<00:06:52.569> where<00:06:53.569> the<00:06:53.690> gout<00:06:53.900> where<00:06:54.169> the

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:54.259 
Gaucho weave where the gout where the

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.200 
Gaucho weave where the gout where the
arrows<00:06:54.529> go<00:06:54.770> around<00:06:55.069> the<00:06:55.190> knot<00:06:55.370> as<00:06:55.789> opposed<00:06:56.120> to

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
arrows go around the knot as opposed to

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.909 
arrows go around the knot as opposed to
the<00:06:56.360> herringbone<00:06:56.659> where<00:06:57.020> they<00:06:57.139> go<00:06:57.289> long<00:06:57.710> ways

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
the herringbone where they go long ways

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.659 
the herringbone where they go long ways
across<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.430> knot<00:07:02.050> okay<00:07:03.219> coming<00:07:04.219> back<00:07:04.460> into

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
across the knot okay coming back into

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:11.020 
across the knot okay coming back into
the<00:07:04.880> nut

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.499 

we're<00:07:12.030> going<00:07:12.180> to<00:07:12.240> split<00:07:12.509> this<00:07:12.749> pair<00:07:14.509> split

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:15.509 
we're going to split this pair split

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:20.659 
we're going to split this pair split
this<00:07:15.749> pair<00:07:17.300> exit<00:07:18.300> over<00:07:18.389> to
