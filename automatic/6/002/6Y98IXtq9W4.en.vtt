they show like this little kind of like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.670

a<00:03:30.810> game<00:03:31.350> clip<00:03:31.850> which<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.239> me<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.690> gets<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.620> of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
a game clip which to me it gets kind of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.340

boring<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.610> kind<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.120> bypass<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
boring and I kind of just bypass it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.979 
boring and I kind of just bypass it
because<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> same<00:03:38.510> stuff<00:03:39.510> every<00:03:39.720> time

all the players doing the same moves but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.900 
all the players doing the same moves but
I<00:03:43.530> do<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.890> when<00:03:44.250> they<00:03:44.340> show<00:03:44.519> their<00:03:44.670> players
