00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
position and I'll show you why in a bit

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.710 
position and I'll show you why in a bit
and<00:02:11.470> string<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.799> string<00:02:13.160> length<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.420> coil

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and string my string length and the coil

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.160 
and string my string length and the coil
length<00:02:15.080> here<00:02:15.470> causes<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.040> cloth<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:17.170> blanket

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
length here causes the cloth to blanket

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.259 
length here causes the cloth to blanket
not<00:02:19.040> go<00:02:19.220> down<00:02:19.430> straight<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.209> to

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
not go down straight and I'm going to

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.520 
not go down straight and I'm going to
show<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.390> why<00:02:20.570> that's<00:02:20.690> important<00:02:21.290> too

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
show you why that's important too

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.039 
show you why that's important too
because<00:02:22.220> something<00:02:22.670> I've<00:02:22.820> seen<00:02:23.330> machines<00:02:23.780> do

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
because something I've seen machines do

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.500 
because something I've seen machines do
this<00:02:24.260> watch<00:02:24.820> I'm<00:02:25.820> going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> go<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.299> one

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
this watch I'm going to go for that one

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.670 
this watch I'm going to go for that one
here<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.840> you'll<00:02:26.959> notice<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.530> a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
here and you'll notice I'm going a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.970 
here and you'll notice I'm going a
little<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> right<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.510> prize<00:02:29.980> and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
little bit to the right of the prize and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.759 
little bit to the right of the prize and
here's<00:02:31.340> why<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.970> because<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:33.260> claw<00:02:33.470> when<00:02:33.650> it

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
here's why is because the claw when it

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.410 
here's why is because the claw when it
goes<00:02:33.890> down<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.370> far<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.000> tilt<00:02:35.239> up

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
goes down this far it's going to tilt up

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
goes down this far it's going to tilt up
like<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.410> curve<00:02:36.739> see

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
like that and it's going to curve see

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.130 
like that and it's going to curve see
that<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:39.830> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.489> go<00:02:40.670> off<00:02:41.140> there

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
that so you kind of have to go off there

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.630 
that so you kind of have to go off there
are<00:02:42.290> machines<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.799> are<00:02:42.950> like<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.580> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
are machines that are like this and the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.550 
are machines that are like this and the
reason<00:02:44.060> why<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.269> either<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.080> string<00:02:45.410> length

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
reason why is either the string length

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.069 
reason why is either the string length
is<00:02:45.829> too<00:02:46.010> short<00:02:46.250> or<00:02:46.519> when<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.269> goes<00:02:47.450> down<00:02:47.690> this

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
is too short or when it goes down this

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.330 
is too short or when it goes down this
coil<00:02:48.530> thing<00:02:49.489> only<00:02:49.790> stretches<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.560> far<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.160> when

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
coil thing only stretches so far so when

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.430 
coil thing only stretches so far so when
it<00:02:52.459> when<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.000> goes<00:02:53.269> down<00:02:53.480> real<00:02:53.810> far<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.230> claws

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
it when it goes down real far the claws

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.039 
it when it goes down real far the claws
going<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.799> going<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.519> tilt<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.299> because

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
going to going to tilt like this because

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.080 
going to going to tilt like this because
this<00:02:57.230> thing<00:02:57.440> can<00:02:57.620> only<00:02:57.680> stretch<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.190> far<00:02:58.430> to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
this thing can only stretch so far to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.420 
this thing can only stretch so far to
where<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.330> claw<00:02:59.510> remains<00:02:59.930> straight<00:03:00.430> you'll

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
where the claw remains straight you'll

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.710 
where the claw remains straight you'll
know

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
know

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.210 
know
again<00:03:02.080> I'm<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.710> bit<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
again I'm going a little bit to the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.330 
again I'm going a little bit to the
right<00:03:03.250> here<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.720> prize<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.950> that's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
right here of the prize and that's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.630 
right here of the prize and that's
because<00:03:06.850> see<00:03:07.780> how<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> claw<00:03:08.220> went<00:03:09.220> over<00:03:09.460> like

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
because see how the claw went over like

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.010 
because see how the claw went over like
that<00:03:09.880> ah<00:03:10.440> man<00:03:11.820> see<00:03:12.820> how<00:03:12.940> low<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:13.600> how<00:03:13.660> big<00:03:13.870> like

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
that ah man see how low see how big like

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.230 
that ah man see how low see how big like
the<00:03:14.170> claws<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.650> all<00:03:14.770> even<00:03:15.100> small<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.670> prizes

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.080 
the claws and all even small this prizes
here<00:03:16.590> once<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.740> hits<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.010> top<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:18.730> never

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
here once it hits the top it's never

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.420 
here once it hits the top it's never
going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.420> stay<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:21.010> right<00:03:21.220> there's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.430 
going to stay so you see right there's
the<00:03:21.670> clock<00:03:21.940> close<00:03:22.240> like<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.200> had<00:03:23.320> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
the clock close like as if it had the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.700 
the clock close like as if it had the
prize<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.040> even<00:03:24.280> clamping<00:03:24.820> inside<00:03:25.330> the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
prize it's not even clamping inside the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.440 
prize it's not even clamping inside the
inside<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.860> case<00:03:27.070> there<00:03:27.430> what's<00:03:28.270> going<00:03:28.330> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
inside the case there what's going to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.820 
inside the case there what's going to
happen<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.840> once<00:03:29.020> it<00:03:29.140> hits<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.350> top<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.770> just

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
happen is once it hits the top it's just

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.130 
happen is once it hits the top it's just
going<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.130> shake<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:30.900> it's<00:03:31.900> going<00:03:32.020> up

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
going to shake like this it's going up

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.620 
going to shake like this it's going up
full<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.220> floor<00:03:33.460> remember<00:03:34.209> I'm<00:03:34.300> going<00:03:34.540> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
full on the floor remember I'm going to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.940 
full on the floor remember I'm going to
the<00:03:34.930> right<00:03:35.200> again<00:03:35.970> because<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.780> coil<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
the right again because of that coil and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.770 
the right again because of that coil and
how<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.190> stretches<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.000> moves<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.480> claw

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
how it stretches and it moves the claw

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.560 
how it stretches and it moves the claw
actually<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> left<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.060> left<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
actually to the left to the left to the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.160 
actually to the left to the left to the
left

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
left

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.949 
left
ah<00:03:44.820> but<00:03:45.820> see<00:03:45.970> that's<00:03:46.180> how<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.450> want<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.690> get<00:03:46.840> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
ah but see that's how you want to get it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.630 
ah but see that's how you want to get it
right<00:03:47.110> there<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.040> clamp<00:03:48.370> like

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
right there you want it to clamp like

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.210 
right there you want it to clamp like
that<00:03:48.910> once<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.690> clamps<00:03:50.110> in<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.440> it'll<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
that once it clamps in there it'll get a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.060 
that once it clamps in there it'll get a
really<00:03:51.550> good<00:03:51.700> grip<00:03:52.500> again<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> went<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.860> little

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
really good grip again I went a little

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.050 
really good grip again I went a little
bit<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.400> right<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:56.550> that's<00:03:57.550> how<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.820> want

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
bit to the right and that's how you want

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.660 
bit to the right and that's how you want
to<00:03:58.120> get<00:03:58.270> it<00:03:58.420> right<00:03:58.570> there<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:59.080> like<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.670> and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
to get it right there just like that and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.180 
to get it right there just like that and
it'll<00:04:00.850> clam<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.450> stay<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.170> perfect<00:04:03.010> that's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
it'll clam and stay and perfect that's

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.949 
it'll clam and stay and perfect that's
that's<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.820> way<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.330> want<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.570> get<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.810> right

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that's the way we want to get it right

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.650 
that's the way we want to get it right
there<00:04:05.170> perfect<00:04:06.040> example<00:04:06.790> see<00:04:07.269> how<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.450> claw

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
there perfect example see how the claw

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.390 
there perfect example see how the claw
is<00:04:07.690> clamped<00:04:08.260> inside<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.709> opening<00:04:09.130> there<00:04:09.310> of

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
is clamped inside the opening there of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.120 
is clamped inside the opening there of
the<00:04:09.489> case<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:10.320> it<00:04:11.320> even<00:04:11.709> though<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.890> hit<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
the case and it even though it hit the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.979 
the case and it even though it hit the
top<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.550> didn't<00:04:12.730> shake<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.180> because<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.720> had

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
top it didn't shake out because it had

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.349 
top it didn't shake out because it had
such<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.260> good<00:04:14.560> clamp<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.130> there<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.459> that

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
such a good clamp in there and that

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.670 
such a good clamp in there and that
these<00:04:16.570> are<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> ones<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.140> want<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.350> go<00:04:17.410> for

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
these are the ones you want to go for

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.009 
these are the ones you want to go for
right<00:04:17.890> here<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.880> are<00:04:18.910> like<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.390> I'll<00:04:19.989> show

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
right here that are like this I'll show

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.539 
right here that are like this I'll show
you<00:04:20.229> why<00:04:20.410> these<00:04:20.620> other<00:04:20.859> ones<00:04:21.100> are<00:04:21.250> hard

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
you why these other ones are hard

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.969 
you why these other ones are hard
because<00:04:21.790> it's<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.630> case<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:23.110> closed<00:04:23.500> on<00:04:23.800> this

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
because it's the case is closed on this

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.860 
because it's the case is closed on this
one<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:26.610> it's<00:04:27.610> going<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.970> be<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.570> hard<00:04:29.050> to

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
one and it's going to be really hard to

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.090 
one and it's going to be really hard to
clamp<00:04:31.870> on<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.229> anything<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.860> slide

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
clamp on to anything it's going to slide

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.480 
clamp on to anything it's going to slide
off<00:04:33.370> like<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.729> see<00:04:33.880> them<00:04:34.030> mp3<00:04:34.510> players<00:04:34.780> watch

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
off like you see them mp3 players watch

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.980 
off like you see them mp3 players watch
see<00:04:36.490> how<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.850> that's<00:04:37.270> what's<00:04:37.570> going<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.780> do

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
see how it that's what's going to do

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.870 
see how it that's what's going to do
it's<00:04:38.710> just<00:04:38.770> going<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.100> hit<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.370> all<00:04:39.490> over<00:04:39.760> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
it's just going to hit it all over the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.790 
it's just going to hit it all over the
place<00:04:40.060> now<00:04:40.300> they<00:04:40.450> are<00:04:41.140> went<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.500> little<00:04:41.710> but

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
place now they are went a little but

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.230 
place now they are went a little but
they're<00:04:41.950> much<00:04:42.220> harder<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.910> got<00:04:43.090> to

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
they're much harder and you got to

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.330 
they're much harder and you got to
pretty<00:04:44.080> much<00:04:44.169> be<00:04:44.440> as<00:04:44.560> close<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.100> prize

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
pretty much be as close to the prize

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.860 
pretty much be as close to the prize
shoot<00:04:45.550> as<00:04:45.669> possible<00:04:46.150> because<00:04:46.270> if<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.690> shakes

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
shoot as possible because if it shakes

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.020 
shoot as possible because if it shakes
out<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.500> might<00:04:47.680> luckily<00:04:48.160> knock<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.729> in<00:04:48.850> there

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
out you might luckily knock it in there
