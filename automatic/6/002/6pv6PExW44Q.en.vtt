00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you're going to be pulley going parallel

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.420 
you're going to be pulley going parallel
with<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> coping<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.890> aiming

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
with the coping and then you're aiming

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.090 
with the coping and then you're aiming
for<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.329> part<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.980> going

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
for like one part of it and that's going

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
for like one part of it and that's going
to<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.309> your<00:00:44.399> start<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.820> point<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.719> when

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to be your start off point for like when

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.920 
to be your start off point for like when
your<00:00:46.440> trucks<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> hit<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.390> coping<00:00:48.750> and

your trucks going to hit the coping and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
your trucks going to hit the coping and
then<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> want

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
then from then on you're going to want

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.139 
then from then on you're going to want

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to start leaning in until you are fully

locked onto the coping in a five-o and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.479 
locked onto the coping in a five-o and
then<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.090> ride<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.600> until<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.559> decide

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.170 

personally<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:09.020> locking<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.530> like<00:01:09.680> this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
personally I like locking in like this

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.510 
personally I like locking in like this
because<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.210> way<00:01:11.480> my<00:01:11.630> back<00:01:11.870> wheels<00:01:12.230> like<00:01:12.530> on

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
because that way my back wheels like on

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.070 
there's going to be decent coping it's
easiest<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.549> on<00:02:13.790> pool<00:02:14.150> coping<00:02:14.360> because

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
easiest to do it on pool coping because

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.530 
easiest to do it on pool coping because
it'll<00:02:16.070> give<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.310> some<00:02:16.489> resistance<00:02:17.000> whereas

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
it'll give you some resistance whereas

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.110 
it'll give you some resistance whereas
metal<00:02:18.230> coping<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.739> kind<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.130> slides<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
metal coping it kind of just slides and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
metal coping it kind of just slides and
I<00:02:20.330> don't<00:02:20.840> know<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.110> takes<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> little<00:02:21.650> bit<00:02:21.799> more

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
I don't know it takes a little bit more

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.060 
I don't know it takes a little bit more
scale<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:24.049> don't<00:02:24.200> know<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.500> always<00:02:24.680> like

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
scale but I don't know it always like

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.100 
scale but I don't know it always like
sounds<00:02:25.459> cool<00:02:25.640> when<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.180> pool

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
sounds cool when you do it on pool

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:37.199 
sounds cool when you do it on pool
coping<00:02:27.230> anyway

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.520 

so<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.420> do<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> five-o<00:02:39.019> role<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:39.439> you're

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
so to do a five-o role and you're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.899 
so to do a five-o role and you're
probably<00:02:39.620> gonna<00:02:39.829> want<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.159> learn<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.459> learn

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
probably gonna want to learn it learn

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.479 
probably gonna want to learn it learn
how<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.120> do<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.540> round<00:02:41.840> wall<00:02:42.079> or<00:02:42.489> it's

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
how to do it on a round wall or it's

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.460 
how to do it on a round wall or it's
like<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.909> possible<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.390> do<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:45.140> flat

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
like it's possible to do it on a flat

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.559 
like it's possible to do it on a flat
wall<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:45.890> not<00:02:46.069> as<00:02:46.340> easy<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
wall but it's not as easy because the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.210 
wall but it's not as easy because the
with<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> round<00:02:48.140> while<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.319> curve<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:49.189> can

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
with the round while the curve you can

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190 
with the round while the curve you can
start<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.609> lean<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.000> it'll<00:02:50.689> like<00:02:50.870> keep

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
start to lean in and it'll like keep

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.530 
start to lean in and it'll like keep
your<00:02:51.590> momentum<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:53.150> your<00:02:53.269> weight<00:02:53.420> in

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
your momentum and like your weight in

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.360 
your momentum and like your weight in
the<00:02:53.569> bowl<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.049> it's<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:54.290> easier<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.739> figure

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
the bowl and it's like easier to figure

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.390 
the bowl and it's like easier to figure
it<00:02:55.579> out<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> I'm<00:03:03.319> lazier<00:03:03.680> Monto<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.250> that's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
it out so I'm lazier Monto and that's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.259 
it out so I'm lazier Monto and that's
8500<00:03:05.030> Roland's

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.390 

just<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.420> your<00:03:11.540> toes<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.920> way<00:03:13.069> when<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
just on your toes so that way when you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.650 
just on your toes so that way when you
flip<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.450> back<00:03:14.659> foot<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.109> kind<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.319> gets<00:03:15.500> up
