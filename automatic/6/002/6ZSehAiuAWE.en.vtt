00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 and that to everyone today I will show you how 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.450
 install free apps in ios 8 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.740
 but this is not the method done but 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.740
 another method created by some Chinese 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.290
 and the cool ones that they are also 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.510
 putting applications that only 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.140
 they find in their day for example popcorn 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.430
 time 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.010
 then we are going to generally go down 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.980
 Date and Time 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.500
 they can on any previous day by 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.610
 example July 30 but it has to be 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.610
 before September 20 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.840
 August 26, let's see what has changed 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.590
 the tail I say the date we go to the link 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.420
 that I will leave the description of the video 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.620
 the evil that appears to us one of these 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.230
 obligations that will be installed 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.750
 appears there file but well I tried 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.579
 there is a film or it does not work for me 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.249
 install it 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.540
 but there are obligations for example 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.920
 Minecraft 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.920
 let's try the minecraft 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500
 we give double 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.660
 and we just give it to install 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.730
 we go to the desk and it comes out that says 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.290
 waiting and then wait will start 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.290
 load the application 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.480
 in this area if you click on someone 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.250
 come down 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.250
 he will be able to walk in airs 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.060
 and they can install the application to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.159
 how to kiss 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.080
 to be able to discharge the obligations 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.680
 from this store 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.680
 and that 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 we are going to download 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.110
 we give in install 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.270
 never desk 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.520
 well at this time it's over too 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.150
 to install minecraft we are not going to open 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.150
 to try 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.799
 just expanded the screen because 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.860
 simply put on full screen 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.700
 and as we see main class is working 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.700
 correctly 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 downloaded it just 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.299
 while installing what we are going to do 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.299
 is to try hay file that is an application 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.810
 for devices with jailbreak 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.650
 let's load 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.989
 let's install 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.200
 meanwhile has just finished 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.360
 install vitier obligation 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:18.300
 let's see if there are applications available 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.300
 here we have what is pop with 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.790
 I'm going to install version 1.1 you see 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.060
 which seems to be the most updated of 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.060
 all 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.769
 Here we have 22 gifts, I will give 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.769
 the right that is this 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.250
 and I will install cart 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.400
 with the bacteria twice canceled the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.400
 second 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.459
 the best of this application with relation 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.500
 to what is your kiss is that as the 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.630
 download is done on the desktop and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.390
 not within the chat application 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.519
 in her case 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.319
 the device can work 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.950
 suspended and continue downloading the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.950
 Applications 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.990
 well take off download the file we are going to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 work I do not think it works 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.370
 personally 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.370
 for the holiday with jailbreak 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.620
 had to prove it 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.729
 had to do it 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.729
 to all users 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.180
 have the problem that the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.849
 applications close 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.809
 let's see shot 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.809
 this problem 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 but the application still works in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.350
 background 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.950
 means the application is ok ok 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.030
 for example another one 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.030
 the same date 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.090
 has closed and we saw that they are still 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.610
 running second plane 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.199
 what we are going to do good and also 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.199
 this is for users of 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.729
 of this pitch and pop with time 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.729
 Minecraft 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.260
 we close them we go to the general adjustments 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.100
 Date and Time 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.040
 We return it to some date I give back 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.850
 enough August I'm going directly 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.540
 August and now I can open the 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.700
 applications in a normal way 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.040
 it's going to take a while to open up but it 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.160
 validated final equal not cut them 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.690
 because I'm 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.690
 but the battle things 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.190
 or they also consist 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.310
 pop with time on mobile devices does not 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.860
 it's going to be not available during 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.570
 the whole week of October 12 because 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.530
 are making changes in the 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.330
 servants that's for those who had 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.900
 tested apps on account that no longer 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.900
 it worked 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.310
 if the application takes a little longer in 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.130
 open the first time after having 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.420
 changed the date and you will see the scare is 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.420
 something totally normal 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.260
 let's open all the applications that 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.260
 let's have this system d 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.590
 I think that or by calling him that 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:35.210
 and as we see, they all work in a 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:39.190
 normal and the date is August 17 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.190
 then now we can close them 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:47.270
 we will generate date and time if 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.849
 we can put it up 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.129
 our system in automatic 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:56.689
 and how do you see the obligations now 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.689
 they work normally
