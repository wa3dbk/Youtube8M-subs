00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.780
 hi friends will bring review soy david 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.179
 and today I want to present or compare two 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.670
 versions of the same model of sneaker 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.759
 we are talking about the salomon is the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.750
 absence in the dry version with the 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.529
 new version 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.500
 Solomon is the app 63 ultra there is a 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.340
 version 2 by the means we saw in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.110
 some fair in germany but that I 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.070
 I think it was not commercialized 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.920
 these would be the two shoes that 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.670
 you that the runners know most 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.100
 and you have had as you see a priori not 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.530
 they differ much by any change in the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.469
 design but yes there are changes that we are going 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 I will go teaching little by little we are going to 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.270
 start with what the sole would be like 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.120
 you see the sole of this one is a bit already 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.370
 harmed so to speak with even 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.339
 with clay remains as you see the first 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.820
 difference is tendon here you have this 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.520
 tendon that goes is shorter in the version 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.479
 old while it's quite longer 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.810
 in the new version therefore greater 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.160
 stability for this new version other 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.229
 of the things that has changed is the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.720
 composed of the rubber where it has been made 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.450
 more durable with a lot more durability 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.640
 in the new version also 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 it seems that there are not many changes more 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 we are talking about one version there is another 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.299
 version that would be with the sole for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.610
 fatty terrains these two versions do not 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.829
 they are so they are pretty much the same 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.289
 but if you look here in the part 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.090
 back I'm just going to teach in all this 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.960
 central part there are no tacos while 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.259
 a new version 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.130
 yes there are tacos that favor a little 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.909
 plus the grip in this area therefore 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.520
 changes 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.950
 small but significant in this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.060
 part of the sole 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.490
 fix midsole 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.549
 quite similar there are not many changes 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.190
 maybe yes that the bridge area is more 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.760
 Narrow a little closer 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.650
 the old version and here something has been done 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.200
 wider more stability is to give 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.239
 more get more stability in the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.239
 version does not spend would be the difference 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.980
 see how the average one here eat 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.739
 the two parties while here in the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.220
 inner zone is not eaten if in the part 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.580
 outside let's see the upper is 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.799
 pretty much like I'm going to change the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 new version old version fixes very 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.520
 similar systems fit yes 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.590
 in both fixes 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.260
 practically the same changes that if the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.690
 tongue that before the pocket was in 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.630
 the top and now it's done 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.900
 As in all models, access is 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.400
 from this part from the part 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.970
 let's say below, so to speak 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.940
 but how the cord came out here as 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.060
 over and then it was saved and now the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.480
 cord goes out in a somewhat more way 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.870
 traditional and then saved here 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 you have 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.450
 also the tongue the material is 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.530
 quite similar is a kind of 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.670
 neoprene while this tongue fixes 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.410
 quite similar also with the system 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.210
 end of it in both parts 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.940
 here you have it, I think it's 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.920
 slightly lower in weight at 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.740
 old version but in return it has 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.100
 got more stability and more 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.580
 durability in the new version so 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.040
 the rest 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.660
 Reeds very similar here you have them 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.390
 fix rods very similar chassis 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.160
 heel here you have the new version and 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.170
 here you have the old one practically 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.650
 the same maybe it has gone up a bit more 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.940
 the new version 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.100
 getting the parameters of 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.510
 Stability stability to get a 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.920
 little more stability for this one 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.170
 the version therefore there are changes 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.729
 significant but that are not to the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.049
 seen in principle of our eye we 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.720
 we have to fix we have to 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.539
 inform and above all we will try them 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.449
 to see how these two work 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.030
 differentiated shoes here you have them 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.639
 old version two are new has wanted 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.530
 keep the design a lot but more 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.160
 durability of more stability for this 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.070
 new version of the salomon is the ak 63 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.580
 ultra new with the soma solomon 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.800
 I sense the old version already 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.449
 I invite you to see the comparison in 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.789
 our trail website ryan review 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.289
 puntocom and that you follow us especially in 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.940
 our social networks and I was not 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.070
 youtube channel thing that you are doing 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.180
 right now and I really appreciate you 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.180
 until the next friends
