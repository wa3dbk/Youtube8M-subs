simpler we go to put it together and and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.020 
simpler we go to put it together and and
take<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.380> apart<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.770> store<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:16.460> bunch<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.790> cord

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
take it apart to store the bunch of cord

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.250 
take it apart to store the bunch of cord

allows you to keep everything in the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.780 
allows you to keep everything in the
order<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.770> needs<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.040> be<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.369> can<00:01:19.580> just

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
order that it needs to be you can just

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.880 
order that it needs to be you can just
kind<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.000> like<00:01:20.119> pull<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.420> apart<00:01:23.530> oK<00:01:24.530> we've<00:01:24.650> come

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
kind of like pull it apart oK we've come

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.469 
kind of like pull it apart oK we've come
out<00:01:24.920> far<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:27.280> I'm<00:01:28.280> gonna<00:01:28.490> start<00:01:28.790> threading<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
out far in I'm gonna start threading the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.780 
out far in I'm gonna start threading the
bungee<00:01:30.380> cord<00:01:30.680> through<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.009> other<00:01:31.250> end<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.670> it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
bungee cord through the other end of it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.480 
bungee cord through the other end of it
and<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.259> order<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:33.890> not<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.190> pull

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
and so in order for this not to pull

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.130 
and so in order for this not to pull
through<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.030> side<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:35.509> just<00:01:35.720> gonna<00:01:35.869> duct
