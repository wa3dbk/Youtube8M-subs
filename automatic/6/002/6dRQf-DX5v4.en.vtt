fingers on any Grand Cherokee from 92 to
98<00:00:20.390> I<00:00:20.599> believe<00:00:21.699> anyway<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.119> we<00:00:23.240> start<00:00:23.449> just<00:00:23.599> by

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
98 I believe anyway so we start just by

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.660 
98 I believe anyway so we start just by
loosening<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.140> nuts<00:00:24.349> now<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.130> is<00:00:25.220> an<00:00:25.340> 18

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
loosening the nuts now this is an 18

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640 
loosening the nuts now this is an 18
millimeter<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:26.359> believe<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.900> other<00:00:27.019> side<00:00:27.349> is<00:00:27.500> a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
millimeter I believe the other side is a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.329 
millimeter I believe the other side is a
15<00:00:28.869> you're<00:00:29.869> twisting<00:00:30.230> them<00:00:30.349> off<00:00:30.470> these<00:00:31.130> ones

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
15 you're twisting them off these ones

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.030 
15 you're twisting them off these ones
are<00:00:31.429> pretty<00:00:31.460> rusted<00:00:32.000> on<00:00:32.089> there<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.739> one<00:00:33.920> up

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
are pretty rusted on there the one up

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.259 
are pretty rusted on there the one up
here<00:00:34.070> there's<00:00:34.519> only<00:00:34.610> one<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:35.030> got<00:00:35.150> to<00:00:35.180> worry

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
here there's only one you got to worry

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.950 
here there's only one you got to worry
about<00:00:35.559> it's<00:00:36.559> an<00:00:36.769> 18<00:00:37.339> millimeter<00:00:37.549> as<00:00:37.879> well<00:00:38.089> what

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
about it's an 18 millimeter as well what

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960 
about it's an 18 millimeter as well what
I've<00:00:39.049> done<00:00:39.229> because<00:00:39.350> these<00:00:39.470> are<00:00:39.620> rusty<00:00:40.070> you

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
I've done because these are rusty you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.770 
I've done because these are rusty you
can<00:00:41.120> see<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.570> is<00:00:43.089> I've<00:00:44.089> taken<00:00:44.299> my<00:00:44.540> ratchet

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
can see this is I've taken my ratchet

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.259 
can see this is I've taken my ratchet
and<00:00:45.320> I've<00:00:45.650> also<00:00:45.830> attached<00:00:46.309> a<00:00:46.549> wrench<00:00:46.850> onto<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
and I've also attached a wrench onto the

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.130 
and I've also attached a wrench onto the
end<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:48.409> kind<00:00:48.619> of<00:00:48.680> give<00:00:48.830> more<00:00:49.070> leverage

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
end of it to kind of give more leverage

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.439 
end of it to kind of give more leverage
so<00:00:51.140> when<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.320> grab<00:00:51.619> the<00:00:51.860> wrench<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.610> kind<00:00:53.390> of

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
so when I grab the wrench it kind of

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.270 
so when I grab the wrench it kind of
extends<00:00:53.930> in<00:00:53.989> my<00:00:54.080> reach<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.470> little<00:00:54.589> bit<00:00:54.830> so<00:00:55.250> I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
extends in my reach a little bit so I

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.000 
extends in my reach a little bit so I
have<00:00:55.430> more<00:00:55.670> torque<00:00:56.269> on<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.540> bolt<00:00:56.860> works<00:00:57.860> out

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
have more torque on the bolt works out

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.140 
have more torque on the bolt works out
pretty<00:00:58.129> well<00:00:58.280> I've<00:00:58.580> already<00:00:58.820> gotten<00:00:59.000> it

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
pretty well I've already gotten it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.640 
pretty well I've already gotten it
loosed<00:00:59.330> up<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:02.290> that's<00:01:03.290> what<00:01:03.500> we're<00:01:03.589> doing

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
loosed up so that's what we're doing

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.719 
loosed up so that's what we're doing
right<00:01:03.799> now<00:01:03.890> we're<00:01:04.070> just<00:01:04.220> releasing<00:01:04.400> all<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
right now we're just releasing all the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.130 
right now we're just releasing all the
bolts<00:01:05.030> as<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.239> can<00:01:05.420> see<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:05.780> thing<00:01:06.020> is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
bolts as you can see this thing is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.700 
bolts as you can see this thing is
pretty<00:01:06.710> hashed<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:08.240> all<00:01:08.390> rusted<00:01:08.810> up<00:01:08.960> what

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
pretty hashed it's all rusted up what

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.230 
pretty hashed it's all rusted up what
you<00:01:09.799> get<00:01:09.950> for<00:01:10.189> living<00:01:10.579> in<00:01:10.789> those<00:01:10.909> southern

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
you get for living in those southern

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.249 
you get for living in those southern
states<00:01:13.240> when<00:01:14.240> I've<00:01:14.359> done<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.659> bottom<00:01:15.049> here

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
states when I've done on the bottom here

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.520 
states when I've done on the bottom here
I've<00:01:15.439> lined<00:01:15.649> my<00:01:15.890> 15<00:01:17.049> millimeter<00:01:18.049> wrench<00:01:18.140> up

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
I've lined my 15 millimeter wrench up

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.620 
I've lined my 15 millimeter wrench up
with<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.920> side<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:20.060> I'm<00:01:20.149> just<00:01:20.329> letting<00:01:20.479> it

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
with that side and I'm just letting it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.999 
with that side and I'm just letting it
rest<00:01:20.810> against<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.229> ground<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.710> it'll<00:01:21.859> do<00:01:21.979> all

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
rest against the ground so it'll do all

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.830 
rest against the ground so it'll do all
my<00:01:22.249> holding<00:01:22.670> work<00:01:22.820> for<00:01:23.119> me<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.659> can<00:01:23.810> just

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840

ratcheting<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.499> as<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.960> as<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.499> wrench<00:01:30.710> holds

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
ratcheting it as the as the wrench holds

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.010 
ratcheting it as the as the wrench holds
the<00:01:31.159> other<00:01:31.280> side<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.609> the<00:01:31.670> bolt<00:01:32.109> steady<00:01:35.020> right

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020

the other side of the bolt steady right
here<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.319> can<00:01:36.499> see<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.710> considerable

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
here you can see a considerable

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.289 
here you can see a considerable
difference<00:01:37.729> in<00:01:38.560> quality<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.890> shock<00:01:40.299> bonds

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
difference in quality of shock bonds

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.849 
difference in quality of shock bonds
brand-new<00:01:41.749> many<00:01:41.960> other<00:01:42.079> ones<00:01:42.259> just<00:01:42.380> freakin

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
brand-new many other ones just freakin

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.969 
brand-new many other ones just freakin
rusted<00:01:43.749> anyway<00:01:44.749> besides<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.229> shock<00:01:45.469> out<00:01:45.740> of

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
rusted anyway besides the shock out of

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.239 
rusted anyway besides the shock out of
the<00:01:46.130> vehicle<00:01:46.609> I<00:01:47.109> just<00:01:48.109> got<00:01:48.259> these<00:01:48.380> little<00:01:48.499> that

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
the vehicle I just got these little that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.919 
the vehicle I just got these little that
head<00:01:49.549> right<00:01:49.729> there<00:01:49.999> that<00:01:50.179> sits<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.840> then

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
head right there that sits in and then

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.120 
head right there that sits in and then
this<00:01:51.020> little<00:01:51.229> notch<00:01:51.469> right<00:01:51.499> here<00:01:51.889> there<00:01:52.069> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
this little notch right here there it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.480 
this little notch right here there it
also<00:01:52.249> sits<00:01:52.639> in<00:01:53.649> pretty<00:01:54.649> pretty

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
also sits in pretty pretty

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.529 
also sits in pretty pretty
straightforward<00:01:58.329> so<00:01:59.329> when<00:01:59.420> you're

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
straightforward so when you're

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.510 
straightforward so when you're
installing<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.409> relatively<00:02:00.889> simply<00:02:01.369> no

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
installing it it's relatively simply no

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.760 
installing it it's relatively simply no
the<00:02:01.670> top<00:02:01.880> part<00:02:02.209> just<00:02:02.479> because<00:02:03.439> there's<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the top part just because there's the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.489
