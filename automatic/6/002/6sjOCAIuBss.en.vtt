00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.209
 in this case only 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 we will go to the part 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.540

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.270
 my contacts already recorded but if 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.759
 you do not have the contacts this is going 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.369
