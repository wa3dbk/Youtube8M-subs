00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello respected rule of tanks players 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.400
 Today I would like to consider such 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.330
 topic how to run two world of clients 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.460
 tanks on one thing yet yesterday 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.940
 literally on the forum I saw such 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 the question is how to start it all the same 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 I was tormented by this question for a very long time myself 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.730
 I just wanted to know how I did 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.199
 colleague but my fellow student he installed 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.340
 virtual windows had something on it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 time is still bamboo 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.219
 here it is again virtual Windows and there 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.860
 something in general he is not super user 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.960
 they do not know a lot there so that's something 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 there he poked it and had to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 to summon the master to him personally 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.280
 blame for something there he flew but i 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.000
 still found such a way there people 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 prompted 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 and I am grateful to these very people who 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 prompted this method after all I 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 figured out how to run two 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.390
 client here on one computer and so 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.159
 let's start we have with you ordinary 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.159
 here's a client you see 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:22.539
 then look here is a launcher like 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:25.659
 see i run this simple 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:33.759
 launcher that is it is the main server 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:36.880
 client so also we are not with test 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.579
 i will also launch launcher but if we will 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.020
 just run on will write 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.420
 warning application already running 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 that is, in no other way are we already 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.390
 do not run so we download the program 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.130
 sandbox browser 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.789
