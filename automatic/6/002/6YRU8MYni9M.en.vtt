00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 the human error accident as factor 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.849
 dominant although there are other factors 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.590
 external factors can contribute to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.199
 the occurrence of accidents 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.109
 but as the poor state of the road the greater 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.449
 part of these human failures of which 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 most relevant are incorrect evaluation 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 trafficking overspeed and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.630
 inattention 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.390
 so the behavior of the driver is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.660
 vital being that it should during the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.230
 refrain from practicing any acts that may 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 prejudice the condition with 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.789
 or as the main cause of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 accidents is man the main causes 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.730
 which give rise to accidents are 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.000
 controlled by it and are the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.699
 the driver 's physical and psychological 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 fatigue is the ingestion of alcohol 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.329
 indication or drugs 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.150
 speed and dangerous maneuvers 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.659
 disrespect for flagging and rules 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.570
 driving function 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 analysis of the condition task 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 driver has the function of seeing and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 driving is a complex activity 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.509
 which implies that the driver adapts 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.650
 constantly changing situations and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.320
 challenges 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.079
 so while driving the driver must 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.740
 information through hearing and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.899
 vision to analyze and identify this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 information to be lucid and calm 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.670
 anticipating and predicting situations can 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.680
 affect your condition 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.659
 being aware of what is happening to your 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.380
 regain control of the vehicle. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.380
