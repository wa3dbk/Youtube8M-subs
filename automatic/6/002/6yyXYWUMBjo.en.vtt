00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
you won't need to go get an extended so

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
you won't need to go get an extended so

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
though yeah II megapixel camera I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.840 
though yeah II megapixel camera I
believe<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.020> newer<00:02:40.950> or<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.490> least<00:02:41.700> been

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
believe it's newer or at least been

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.700 
believe it's newer or at least been
adjusted<00:02:42.510> from<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.840> Bionic<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.530> should<00:02:43.680> be

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
adjusted from the Bionic so it should be

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.170 
adjusted from the Bionic so it should be
faster<00:02:44.160> should<00:02:44.370> take<00:02:44.520> crisper<00:02:44.910> clear

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
faster should take crisper clear

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.510 
faster should take crisper clear

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
millimeter headphone jack and here's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.340

your<00:03:10.410> HDMI<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.520> your<00:03:12.270> micro<00:03:12.540> USB<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:13.140> had<00:03:13.260> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
your HDMI and your micro USB they had to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.050 
your HDMI and your micro USB they had to
put<00:03:13.440> them<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:13.650> top<00:03:13.920> since<00:03:14.700> there<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.880> really

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
put them on top since there was really

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.310 
put them on top since there was really
no<00:03:15.270> where<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> put<00:03:15.660> them<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.990> side<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
no where to put them on the side and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.140 
no where to put them on the side and
they<00:03:16.740> also<00:03:16.890> threw<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.490> other<00:03:17.700> poor<00:03:17.970> down

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
they also threw this other poor down

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.690 
they also threw this other poor down
here<00:03:18.560> also<00:03:19.560> I'm<00:03:19.710> assuming<00:03:20.160> those<00:03:20.250> ports<00:03:20.580> are

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
here also I'm assuming those ports are

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.830 
here also I'm assuming those ports are
thick<00:03:20.940> enough<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.210> they<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.510> only<00:03:21.660> be

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
thick enough that they can only be

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.230 
thick enough that they can only be
housed<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.470> thick<00:03:22.770> part<00:03:23.130> okay<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.000> to

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
housed in this thick part okay so to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.820 
housed in this thick part okay so to
keep<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> thin<00:03:24.780> they<00:03:24.990> had<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.200> house<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.530> LTE

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
keep it thin they had to house the LTE

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.210 
keep it thin they had to house the LTE
radio<00:03:26.300> camera<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.750> these<00:03:28.200> two<00:03:28.410> ports<00:03:28.830> all<00:03:29.010> in

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
radio camera and these two ports all in

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.360 
radio camera and these two ports all in
this<00:03:29.370> top<00:03:29.610> part<00:03:29.820> okay<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:31.440> as<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.190> was<00:03:32.220> saying

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
this top part okay so as I was saying

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
this top part okay so as I was saying
earlier<00:03:32.640> with<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.940> resound<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.690> film

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
earlier with the resound this film

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.290 
earlier with the resound this film
definitely<00:03:34.290> feel<00:03:34.560> wider<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.640> your<00:03:35.790> hand<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.210> me

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
definitely feel wider in your hand to me

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.700 
definitely feel wider in your hand to me
it<00:03:36.390> doesn't<00:03:36.540> feel<00:03:36.720> uncomfortable<00:03:37.350> by<00:03:37.530> any

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
it doesn't feel uncomfortable by any

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.650 
it doesn't feel uncomfortable by any
means<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.460> it's<00:03:38.640> definitely<00:03:38.850> wider<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.570> let

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
means but it's definitely wider so let

we are on 4G LTE up there okay so um new
blur<00:05:43.650> let<00:05:44.310> me<00:05:44.400> go<00:05:44.520> back<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:44.940> lock<00:05:45.240> screen

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
blur let me go back to the lock screen

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.600 
blur let me go back to the lock screen
because<00:05:46.530> this<00:05:46.680> is<00:05:46.830> actually<00:05:47.130> different<00:05:47.310> so

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
because this is actually different so

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.850 
because this is actually different so

new lock screen you can either unlock or
you<00:05:49.950> can<00:05:50.070> jump<00:05:50.280> straight<00:05:50.340> in<00:05:50.670> your<00:05:50.700> camera<00:05:51.300> and

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
you can jump straight in your camera and

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.200 
you can jump straight in your camera and
speaking<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.470> cameras<00:05:53.010> it's<00:05:53.880> go<00:05:53.970> ahead<00:05:54.120> and

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
speaking of cameras it's go ahead and

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.360 
speaking of cameras it's go ahead and
take<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:54.360> picture<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:55.650> we<00:05:55.710> can<00:05:55.830> see<00:05:55.920> how<00:05:56.010> fast

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
take a picture so we can see how fast

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.040 
take a picture so we can see how fast
this<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.790> since<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.090> forgot<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.480> do<00:05:57.660> this<00:05:57.810> when<00:05:58.020> I

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
this is since I forgot to do this when I

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.750 
this is since I forgot to do this when I
was<00:05:58.200> in<00:05:58.380> New<00:05:58.500> York<00:06:00.050> all<00:06:01.050> right<00:06:01.230> folks<00:06:01.760> jump

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
was in New York all right folks jump

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.120 
was in New York all right folks jump
back<00:06:02.940> in<00:06:03.120> there<00:06:03.300> okay<00:06:04.230> camera<00:06:04.800> takes<00:06:05.070> picture

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
back in there okay camera takes picture

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.340 
back in there okay camera takes picture
of<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.460> rezound<00:06:05.880> and<00:06:06.830> focus<00:06:08.930> folks<00:06:09.930> still

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
of the rezound and focus folks still

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.480 
of the rezound and focus folks still
pretty<00:06:10.530> slow<00:06:10.970> camera<00:06:11.970> was<00:06:12.120> definitely<00:06:12.510> fast

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
pretty slow camera was definitely fast

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.340 
pretty slow camera was definitely fast
like<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:14.520> can<00:06:14.730> just<00:06:14.760> snap<00:06:15.180> pictures<00:06:15.480> all

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
like you can just snap pictures all

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.050 
like you can just snap pictures all
right<00:06:16.470> that's<00:06:16.620> pretty<00:06:16.830> fast<00:06:17.100> so<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.790> might

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
right that's pretty fast so that might

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.150 
right that's pretty fast so that might
not<00:06:18.090> be<00:06:18.270> Galaxy<00:06:19.080> Nexus<00:06:19.230> fast<00:06:20.270> once<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.450> focuses

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
not be Galaxy Nexus fast once it focuses

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.870 
not be Galaxy Nexus fast once it focuses
let's<00:06:23.160> take<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.310> picture<00:06:23.430> something<00:06:23.730> they

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
let's take a picture something they

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.140 
let's take a picture something they
actually<00:06:24.150> see<00:06:24.480> there<00:06:24.960> we<00:06:25.050> go<00:06:26.210> focus<00:06:27.210> snap

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
actually see there we go focus snap

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.820 
actually see there we go focus snap
alright<00:06:30.150> that's<00:06:30.510> actually<00:06:30.780> pretty<00:06:30.900> fast<00:06:31.200> so<00:06:31.440> I

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
alright that's actually pretty fast so I

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.770 
alright that's actually pretty fast so I
can't<00:06:32.730> tell<00:06:32.940> what<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.150> quality<00:06:33.480> is<00:06:33.600> going<00:06:33.720> to

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
can't tell what the quality is going to

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.590 
can't tell what the quality is going to
be<00:06:33.870> like<00:06:33.990> on<00:06:34.200> here<00:06:34.410> yet<00:06:34.620> but<00:06:35.510> that<00:06:36.510> was

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
be like on here yet but that was

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.330 
be like on here yet but that was
actually<00:06:36.720> pretty<00:06:36.900> good<00:06:37.200> so<00:06:37.440> anyway<00:06:37.740> um<00:06:37.920> the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
actually pretty good so anyway um the

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.710 
actually pretty good so anyway um the
other<00:06:38.370> thing<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.700> forgot<00:06:38.820> to<00:06:38.970> mention<00:06:39.060> is<00:06:39.450> it<00:06:39.630> is

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
other thing I forgot to mention is it is

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.430 
other thing I forgot to mention is it is
a<00:06:39.750> 4.3

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
a 4.3

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.990 
a 4.3
HD<00:06:40.680> screen<00:06:40.950> but<00:06:41.130> it's<00:06:41.250> different<00:06:41.580> than<00:06:41.910> the

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
HD screen but it's different than the

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.300 
HD screen but it's different than the
Bionic<00:06:42.450> and<00:06:42.510> the<00:06:42.630> droid<00:06:42.840> 3<00:06:42.990> it's<00:06:43.620> super<00:06:43.890> amoled

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
Bionic and the droid 3 it's super amoled

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.280 
Bionic and the droid 3 it's super amoled
advanced<00:06:45.030> as<00:06:45.510> far<00:06:45.540> as<00:06:45.840> i<00:06:45.900> know<00:06:45.960> that's

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
advanced as far as i know that's

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.500 
advanced as far as i know that's
essentially<00:06:46.890> like<00:06:47.160> a<00:06:47.190> super<00:06:47.550> amoled<00:06:47.940> well<00:06:48.480> i

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
essentially like a super amoled well i

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.030 
essentially like a super amoled well i
guess<00:06:48.690> it's<00:06:48.810> not<00:06:48.930> because<00:06:49.140> it's<00:06:49.260> still<00:06:49.500> sort

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
guess it's not because it's still sort

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.220 
guess it's not because it's still sort
of<00:06:50.100> pentile<00:06:50.520> ably<00:06:50.850> anyway<00:06:51.540> what<00:06:51.750> I<00:06:51.780> was<00:06:51.900> told

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
of pentile ably anyway what I was told

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.920 
of pentile ably anyway what I was told
by<00:06:52.830> a<00:06:52.860> motor<00:06:53.130> rep<00:06:53.400> is<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.670> it's<00:06:53.820> like<00:06:54.090> super

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
by a motor rep is that it's like super

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.550 
by a motor rep is that it's like super
amoled<00:06:55.260> plus<00:06:55.290> but<00:06:56.130> it's<00:06:56.280> qhd<00:06:57.030> so<00:06:57.330> it's<00:06:57.480> not<00:06:57.630> 800

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
amoled plus but it's qhd so it's not 800

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.210 
amoled plus but it's qhd so it's not 800
x<00:06:58.680> 480<00:06:59.190> resolution<00:06:59.490> it's<00:07:00.330> 960<00:07:00.990> x<00:07:01.110> 540<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.770> don't

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
x 480 resolution it's 960 x 540 I don't

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.320 
x 480 resolution it's 960 x 540 I don't
know<00:07:02.280> that<00:07:02.400> I<00:07:02.460> necessarily<00:07:02.520> believe<00:07:02.940> that

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
know that I necessarily believe that

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.990 
know that I necessarily believe that
it's<00:07:03.480> not<00:07:03.630> a<00:07:03.990> pentile<00:07:04.680> but<00:07:04.980> it's<00:07:05.790> going<00:07:05.940> to

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
it's not a pentile but it's going to

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.280 
it's not a pentile but it's going to
look<00:07:06.150> a<00:07:06.270> lot<00:07:06.420> more<00:07:06.480> beautiful<00:07:07.020> than<00:07:07.170> the

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
look a lot more beautiful than the

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.290 
look a lot more beautiful than the
bionics<00:07:07.770> you<00:07:08.580> can<00:07:08.700> see<00:07:08.850> just<00:07:08.880> flicking

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
bionics you can see just flicking

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.180 
bionics you can see just flicking
through<00:07:09.720> stuff<00:07:10.020> you<00:07:10.230> don't<00:07:10.350> get<00:07:10.620> that<00:07:10.770> sort<00:07:11.100> of

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
through stuff you don't get that sort of

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.720 
through stuff you don't get that sort of
blur<00:07:12.030> and<00:07:12.300> jittery<00:07:13.290> and<00:07:13.680> you<00:07:14.400> know<00:07:14.520> all<00:07:14.700> that

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
blur and jittery and you know all that

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.420 
blur and jittery and you know all that
nonsense<00:07:15.120> that<00:07:15.570> you<00:07:16.110> get<00:07:16.320> you<00:07:17.190> can<00:07:17.310> actually

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
nonsense that you get you can actually

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.220 
nonsense that you get you can actually
flick<00:07:17.910> through<00:07:18.120> these<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:18.660> everything

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 
flick through these and everything

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.730 
flick through these and everything
doesn't<00:07:19.380> go<00:07:19.530> blurred<00:07:20.420> so<00:07:21.420> anyway<00:07:21.960> tons<00:07:22.650> of

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
doesn't go blurred so anyway tons of
