00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
okay it's plugged in and I have it

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.890 
okay it's plugged in and I have it
sitting<00:00:24.070> on<00:00:24.220> this<00:00:24.430> board<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.360> tracks<00:00:25.630> aren't

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
sitting on this board the tracks aren't

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.760 
sitting on this board the tracks aren't
touching<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.880> so<00:00:28.570> I'm<00:00:28.840> gonna<00:00:29.050> hit<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.470> switch

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
touching and so I'm gonna hit the switch

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.420 
touching and so I'm gonna hit the switch
here

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
here

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:41.750 
here
I'm<00:00:30.550> sure<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.150> tracks<00:00:31.419> move

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.970 

and<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.600> it<00:00:43.690> sounds<00:00:43.930> pretty<00:00:44.020> good

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
and so it sounds pretty good

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.610 
and so it sounds pretty good
so<00:00:45.400> I'm<00:00:45.520> gonna<00:00:45.640> put<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:45.940> back<00:00:46.090> together<00:00:46.620> then

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
so I'm gonna put it back together then

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.540 
so I'm gonna put it back together then
I'm<00:00:47.740> gonna<00:00:47.860> run<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.250> on<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.890> ground<00:00:50.890> take<00:00:51.520> a

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
I'm gonna run it on the ground take a

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.330 
I'm gonna run it on the ground take a
picture<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.830> get<00:00:53.830> it<00:00:53.920> back<00:00:54.040> to<00:00:54.100> you

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
picture of it and get it back to you

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:19.480 
picture of it and get it back to you
hopefully

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.850 

this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.760> control<00:01:21.120> box<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:23.480> this<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this is the control box and this is the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.750 
this is the control box and this is the
left<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.610> control<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.580> this<00:01:29.580> is

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
left and right control here and this is

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.230 
left and right control here and this is
forward<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.130> neutral<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:33.030> back

forward and back and neutral and back

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
forward and back and neutral and back
here<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.130> says<00:01:35.280> stop<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:36.870> is<00:01:37.200> not

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
here this actually says stop this is not

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.750 
here this actually says stop this is not
an<00:01:37.920> original<00:01:38.130> light<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:40.440> says<00:01:40.680> 16<00:01:41.100> volts<00:01:41.490> there

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
an original light it says 16 volts there

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.680 
an original light it says 16 volts there
and<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.790> low<00:01:44.790> speed<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> high<00:01:45.390> speed

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
and this is the low speed and high speed

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.560 
and this is the low speed and high speed
button<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.620> original<00:01:47.160> these<00:01:48.090> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
button which is original these this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.570 
button which is original these this
switch<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.870> switch<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.650> light<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.160> don't

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
switch this switch in this light I don't

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.610 
switch this switch in this light I don't
think<00:01:50.700> our<00:01:50.970> original<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.750> switch<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.440> was

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
think our original the switch is it was

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.180 
think our original the switch is it was
added<00:01:52.980> four<00:01:53.270> lights<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.830> switch<00:01:56.070> was

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
added four lights or in this switch was

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.390 
added four lights or in this switch was
added<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.610> power<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.180> power<00:01:57.450> off<00:01:58.160> it<00:01:59.160> says

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
added for power on power off it says

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.830

this<00:02:09.780> rubber<00:02:10.410> cap<00:02:11.210> here<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:13.170> original<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.940> is

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
this rubber cap here is original this is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.240 
this rubber cap here is original this is
not<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.350> one<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.830> original

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
not this the other one is not original

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.479 
not this the other one is not original
it's<00:02:17.370> similar<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.500> would<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> fairly<00:02:20.190> easy

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
it's similar and it would be fairly easy

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.040 
it's similar and it would be fairly easy
to<00:02:20.700> find<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.030> replacement<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
to find a replacement I think of the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.050 
to find a replacement I think of the
right<00:02:22.230> size<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> little<00:02:23.670> bit<00:02:23.760> harder

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
right size this is a little bit harder

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:47.420 
right size this is a little bit harder
plastic<00:02:24.570> than<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.930> one

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.199 

the<00:02:48.090> control<00:02:48.870> box<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:52.519> original<00:02:53.519> except<00:02:54.000> that

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the control box is original except that

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.280 
the control box is original except that
the<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:58.189> power<00:02:59.189> cord<00:02:59.970> adapter<00:03:00.209> has<00:03:00.780> been<00:03:00.959> added

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the a power cord adapter has been added

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.630 
the a power cord adapter has been added
to<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:03.379> this<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> tractor<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
to it this is the tractor and the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.490 
to it this is the tractor and the
connector<00:03:06.329> has<00:03:06.450> been<00:03:06.629> modified<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.170> allow

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
connector has been modified to allow

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.039 
connector has been modified to allow
lights<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.090> put<00:03:09.329> on<00:03:09.359> and<00:03:11.599> originally<00:03:12.599> this

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
lights to be put on and originally this

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.710 
lights to be put on and originally this
was<00:03:13.109> sealed<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> was<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.540> was<00:03:15.629> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
was sealed so and it was it was a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.250 
was sealed so and it was it was a
ticking<00:03:16.170> apart<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:17.390> water<00:03:18.390> got<00:03:18.750> inside

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
ticking apart because water got inside

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.610 
ticking apart because water got inside
so<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.739> had<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:19.920> be<00:03:20.069> fixed<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.870> allows<00:03:22.440> me

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so it had to be fixed so this allows me

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.410 
so it had to be fixed so this allows me
to<00:03:22.799> come<00:03:23.099> off<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:24.440> there<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.859> hinged<00:03:26.420> and
