00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello to all and teachers for 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.930
 a new puzzle game today we 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.630
 will make the jump classified Greenwich 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.220
 21st in our explorers card I 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.369
 is currently in the plateau 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.860
 from goddess to zone 15 25 tanks near the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.090
 crossing point of the moors ravaged us 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
 let's go back to the land 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.509
 ascalonians of course it will only be 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.509
 ghosts 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.600
 as you see the mobs will try 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.950
 of you where you are of course but they 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 are very annoying so try to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.720
 stay alive just the time of this plan 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 this success anyway then I you 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.490
 authorize to die one passes over the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.900
 canons we go up the stairs and we do 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.400
 a jump that will be rather tough 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.500
 since we will have control and in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.560
 the air to arrive on the right 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 well played embarrassing about we'll let go 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.410
 the ascalonians ki moon who we 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.830
 annoying in this sense here then here and that 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.830
 should be good 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.110
 the in combat mode tonight may be 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.990
 a little difficult you should land 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.810
 on the cornice which on the other side I 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 do them just so it's possible 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.390
 it is also rather complex because not 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.039
 you will have to land on this rock has it 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.039
 well done and we continue 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.250
 attention to this jump because you will have to 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.170
 make a turn in the air we have 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.450
 successful up there is a veteran a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.580
 ballista and rich silver ores 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 success is unlocked when you 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940
 get on this on this place 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 thank you all for viewing this 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.370
 video it was teachers and we find ourselves 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.370
 in an upcoming puzzle game
