 further if so if some ideas if he would ap ap ap maybe 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.260

 the unfortunate by the firemen toulouse 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.839

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.219
 or not 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.890
 and you 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.890
 m 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.819
 I 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.039

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.029
 this 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.479
 to start this evening a hundred he goes in 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.169
 it seems to me 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.019
 the cdu 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.889
 70 'to 400m 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.889
 it's a lot what 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.219
 m 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.959
 24 inches 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.779
 then we had more trouble but for the container 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 the three meet at by 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:16.859
 apart 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.709
 Why 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.220
 the story for his departure 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.319
 m the center 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.319
 it's not human to match this mobile palm pack 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.020
 this 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.020
 according to him 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.830
 then m she repeats 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.610
 do we have 300 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.639
 stone 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.490
 2 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 3 it speaks 2 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.940
 a bruise 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.210
 m attached park price 12 euros 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.210
 so since that's all 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.139
 826 then comatose the human spirit m some cent 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.949
 destatis 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.960
 for 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.120
 a pass 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.129
 not bad 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.749
 2 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:12.479
 the participants 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.160
 against him 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.559
 on average so without any compensation 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.030
 so I'm only at my head 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.000
 m 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.189
 bowls 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.169
 so 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.940
 550 matches 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 to the machine 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.569
 in his rest time 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.020
 2 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.080
 without much surprise 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.330
 then 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.900
 400 still componentone 400 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.860
 400 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.029
 amara 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.460
 and for good reason 3 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.050
 2 against the counters 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
 I think very low 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.219
 so during bleeding 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.960
 ladies 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.629
 we talk a lot why 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.439
 I count myself 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.439
 hundred 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.270
 4 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.270
 the respondent is not completed 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.999
 ok probably because years 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.999
 when we talk often 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.089
 two hamas fighters 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.400
 the birds these central banks 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.409
 return from locker room 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.520
 the largest in the world 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.969
 childish more 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.729
 pity 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.729
 and because it's so 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.009
 though 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.009
 in tears 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.770
 m 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.770

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.529
 ap but here you go 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.080
 so that's perfect 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.180
 indeed 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.659
 the work consists of 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.699
 cannes apartments not increase 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.699
 lucas powerful states a lot of sense for me 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.189
 Tuesday guys 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:31.919
