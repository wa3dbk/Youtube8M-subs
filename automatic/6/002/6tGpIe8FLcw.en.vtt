 which still bought 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.780
 sync scrap thread 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 are the main elements from the deck we say 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.950
 which can then be done for synchronizing as they do 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.830
 asynchronous 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.039
