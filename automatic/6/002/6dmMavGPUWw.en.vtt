00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:08.650
 We introduce card of Dragon Ball Heroes this time 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.740
 Card of s rare to receive for free distribution by examination 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.549
 Now we get a visitor from the 21 days of March, but had to introduce Goku in the previous video 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.140
 The 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:22.470
 This is also I had been got the rainbow father raise the videos have been but little flap 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:30.769
 It has been late 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.769
 The cards of Vegeta are also pretty professional like Goku and they feel like sa. 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:40.340
 Yes it looks like this year 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.340
 Normal of the base back is this I Zita 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:49.290
 The mark on this chest is a cloud, but the mark on this chest is anxious 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.030
 I look forward to the release of the movie 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:00.360
 There was free distribution of this s rare for two weeks in a row, but April 18 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.260
 It seems that Freezer's cards will also be distributed from b on the movie, so we will pay attention to that too 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.810
 I think 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.979
 You can do some god missions from there and you can issue the Ultimate Order 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.280
 Was 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.530
 It is Vegeta normal ultimate layer 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.420
 When it first snowed, it was the beginning of or sd open 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.540
 It's beautiful finely 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:29.800
 previous 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:31.990
 It is the same as Ultimate Reed compared to the one of 8 Brolee glory of the group 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.540
 Processing is different 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:42.530
 The pros are very glaring, but this Vegeta is refreshing . 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.530
 But it is so thin that this is cool 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 Hmm 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:58.040
 Yes unit in such a feeling is the endless challenge unit in the Murakuni normal and Biusu Normal 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.230
 Compared with the same God Mission campaign, Ultimate Rea is either 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.120
 Also 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.740
 It is cool It is good after all the campaign 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.250
 I also want other types, so I want to continue doing Dragon Ball Heroes again 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.250
 I'm sorry
