00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
realize what you about to say so it's

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.770 
realize what you about to say so it's
very<00:04:31.190> similar<00:04:31.460> with<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.090> break<00:04:32.270> defects<00:04:32.630> to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
very similar with the break defects to

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.150 
very similar with the break defects to
what<00:04:32.900> we've<00:04:33.020> seen<00:04:33.199> with<00:04:33.260> ice<00:04:33.530> cream<00:04:33.770> sandwich

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160

what we've seen with ice cream sandwich
with<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.789> swiftkey<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.599> everything<00:04:36.260> else

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
with to a swiftkey and everything else

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.260 
with to a swiftkey and everything else
so<00:04:36.590> it's<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.370> more<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> fact<00:04:37.789> that<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.090> all

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so it's the more the fact that it's all

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.680 
so it's the more the fact that it's all
in<00:04:38.720> one<00:04:39.080> one<00:04:39.830> easy<00:04:40.070> convenient<00:04:40.580> solution<00:04:41.180> so
