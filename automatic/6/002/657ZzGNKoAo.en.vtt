playing<00:01:45.270> black<00:01:45.750> ops<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.380> I'd<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:46.680> been

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
playing black ops so I'd only been

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
playing black ops so I'd only been

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
playing it for a day so clearly I am

playing it for a day so clearly I am
improving<00:01:50.540> my<00:01:51.540> aim<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.990> getting<00:01:52.170> better<00:01:52.520> i'm

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
improving my aim is getting better i'm

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.050 
improving my aim is getting better i'm
using<00:01:53.810> sensitivity<00:01:54.810> high<00:01:55.549> but<00:01:56.549> i<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.880> i

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
using sensitivity high but i think i

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
using sensitivity high but i think i
will<00:01:57.119> boost<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.979> even<00:01:59.880> higher<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
will boost that up to even higher now I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.180 
will boost that up to even higher now I
thought<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.040> bit

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
thought this bit

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.180 
thought this bit
is<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.700> bit

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
is it this bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.890 
is it this bit

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
stay on the edge of the map and try and

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.170 
stay on the edge of the map and try and
camp<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.830> bit<00:02:30.130> till<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.459> got<00:02:30.580> blown<00:02:30.850> up<00:02:30.880> by

guy comes out and starts shooting him he
thinks<00:02:41.610> he's<00:02:41.790> safe<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:42.990> shoot<00:02:43.440> him<00:02:43.650> through

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
in health door and stupidly I didn't

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.740 
in health door and stupidly I didn't
realize<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.660> had<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.930> radar<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:32.750> missile

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
realize that I had a radar and a missile

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.090

strike<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> had<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.020> didn't<00:03:37.980> actually

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
strike so I had it but I didn't actually

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.660 
strike so I had it but I didn't actually
use<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.700> which<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.630> quite<00:03:40.470> shameful<00:03:41.280> because

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
use it which was quite shameful because

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.970 
use it which was quite shameful because
I<00:03:41.700> could<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.180> technically<00:03:42.900> come<00:03:43.260> first<00:03:43.680> if

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.580 
I could have technically come first if
I'd<00:03:44.130> used<00:03:44.489> those<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:46.110> have<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.320> i'm
