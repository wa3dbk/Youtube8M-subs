hard drive 2 GB graphic card based
laptop<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.670> comes<00:00:47.910> along<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> mighty

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
laptop so this comes along with a mighty

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
laptop so this comes along with a mighty
bad<00:00:49.530> adapter<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.489> waters<00:00:50.850> rating<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.300> 19

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
bad adapter and the waters rating is 19

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.010 
bad adapter and the waters rating is 19
volts<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> four<00:00:52.469> point<00:00:52.680> seven<00:00:52.890> four<00:00:53.190> amperes

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
volts and four point seven four amperes

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
volts and four point seven four amperes
so<00:00:55.020> number<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> power<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.489> needed<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.789> charge

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so number of power is needed to charge

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.990 
so number of power is needed to charge
this<00:00:57.329> thing<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> battery<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.910> you
