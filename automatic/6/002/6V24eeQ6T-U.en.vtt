00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
homemade clock using simple materials so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.670 
homemade clock using simple materials so
it<00:00:14.639> turns<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.599> loaded<00:00:16.230> these<00:00:16.320> lolly

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
it turns out I have loaded these lolly

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040 
it turns out I have loaded these lolly
sticks<00:00:17.010> left<00:00:17.279> over<00:00:17.640> from<00:00:17.910> previous<00:00:18.050> projects

I'd<00:00:19.470> say<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.310> time<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.820> put<00:00:20.850> them<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I'd say it's about time we put them to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.120 
I'd say it's about time we put them to
good<00:00:21.420> use

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
clock movement kit I purchased online so
I<00:00:33.960> began<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.829> measuring<00:00:35.280> two<00:00:35.489> holes<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
I began by measuring two holes on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.560 
I began by measuring two holes on the
stick

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
stick

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
stick
the<00:00:36.719> first<00:00:36.989> being<00:00:37.320> around<00:00:37.680> five<00:00:38.070> millimeters

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the first being around five millimeters

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
the first being around five millimeters
from<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> end<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.719> other<00:00:39.750> around<00:00:40.410> 20

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
from the end and the other around 20

from the end and the other around 20
millimeters<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> other<00:00:42.059> end<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.570> then

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
millimeters from the other end I then

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
millimeters from the other end I then
use<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> guide<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.610> drill<00:00:44.850> holes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
use this as a guide to drill holes

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
use this as a guide to drill holes
through<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.780> other<00:00:45.899> sticks<00:00:48.950> altogether

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
through the other sticks altogether

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.319 
through the other sticks altogether
I<00:00:50.160> made<00:00:50.489> 44<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:52.489> then<00:00:53.489> using<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> string

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I made 44 of these then using the string

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
I made 44 of these then using the string
I<00:00:54.600> threaded<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.649> outer<00:00:55.829> holes

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
I threaded it through the outer holes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.790 
I threaded it through the outer holes
and<00:00:56.610> placed<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.210> black<00:00:57.480> followed<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.469> white

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and placed one black followed by a white

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.179 
and placed one black followed by a white
pony<00:00:59.160> bead<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.699> between<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:04.100> repeated<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
pony bead in between I repeated this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
pony bead in between I repeated this
process<00:01:05.280> until<00:01:05.970> I'd<00:01:06.270> used<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.689> most<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
process until I'd used up most of the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.719 
process until I'd used up most of the
sticks

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.029 

I<00:01:16.759> then<00:01:17.450> used<00:01:17.689> another<00:01:18.049> length<00:01:18.289> of<00:01:18.469> string<00:01:18.740> for

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
I then used another length of string for

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:31.149 
I then used another length of string for
the<00:01:19.100> inner<00:01:19.280> holes<00:01:29.259> in<00:01:30.259> order<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.979> lace<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
the inner holes in order to lace it

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.980 
the inner holes in order to lace it
together<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.939> left<00:01:32.270> two<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.720> sticks

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
together I left two of the sticks

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.510 
together I left two of the sticks
without<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.500> beads<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:33.920> between<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
without the beads in between and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.700 
without the beads in between and
intertwine<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.450> string<00:01:35.780> through<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.319> sticks

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
intertwine the string through the sticks

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:48.609 
intertwine the string through the sticks
like<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:46.630> then<00:01:47.630> tied<00:01:47.869> them<00:01:48.049> together<00:01:48.229> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
like so I then tied them together and

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:59.169 
like so I then tied them together and
chopped<00:01:49.099> off<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> remaining<00:01:49.909> string<00:01:58.149> now<00:01:59.149> I

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
chopped off the remaining string now I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.300 
chopped off the remaining string now I
came<00:01:59.569> across<00:01:59.720> this<00:02:00.079> lid<00:02:00.380> from<00:02:00.709> a<00:02:00.829> milk<00:02:01.069> carton

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
came across this lid from a milk carton

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:11.289 
came across this lid from a milk carton
that<00:02:01.579> fits<00:02:01.939> perfectly<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.720> center<00:02:10.299> after

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
that fits perfectly in the center after

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.720 
that fits perfectly in the center after
some<00:02:11.780> filing<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.380> drilled<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:12.829> hole<00:02:12.860> directly<00:02:13.370> in

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
some filing I drilled a hole directly in

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.910 
some filing I drilled a hole directly in
the<00:02:13.880> center<00:02:14.269> big<00:02:14.750> enough<00:02:14.959> for<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> screw<00:02:15.709> of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the center big enough for the screw of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.150 
the center big enough for the screw of
the<00:02:15.950> quartz<00:02:16.400> movement<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.000> fit<00:02:17.180> through<00:02:17.480> I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.040 

then<00:02:22.160> stuck<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.609> in<00:02:22.700> place<00:02:22.940> using<00:02:23.299> hot<00:02:23.690> glue

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.680 

I<00:02:29.340> decided<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.610> glue<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.000> miniature<00:02:31.360> disk

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I decided to glue this miniature disk

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.510 
I decided to glue this miniature disk
behind<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.260> clock<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.190> should<00:02:33.370> help

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
behind the clock this should help

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.280 
behind the clock this should help
strengthen<00:02:33.880> up<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.210> sticks<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.870> prevent<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
strengthen up the sticks to prevent the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:46.470 
strengthen up the sticks to prevent the
whole<00:02:35.470> thing<00:02:35.710> from<00:02:35.950> flopping<00:02:36.370> around<00:02:45.480> once

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
whole thing from flopping around once

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.210 
whole thing from flopping around once
that<00:02:46.720> was<00:02:46.870> done<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.230> screwed<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.890> quartz

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that was done I screwed the quartz

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.770 
that was done I screwed the quartz
movement<00:02:48.700> into<00:02:49.210> place

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
movement into place

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.140 
movement into place
I<00:02:52.740> then<00:02:53.740> pieced<00:02:54.040> together<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.670> hands<00:02:54.880> that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
I then pieced together the hands that

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.790 
I then pieced together the hands that
came<00:02:55.360> with<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.600> kit<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:59.140> added<00:02:59.680> the
