00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.440 
and I personally don't use it that often
anymore<00:03:35.510> because<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.500> boring<00:03:37.389> for<00:03:38.389> me

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
anymore because it's just boring for me

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.590 
anymore because it's just boring for me
to<00:03:38.720> play<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:40.549> same<00:03:40.730> weapons<00:03:41.239> all<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
to play with the same weapons all the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.229 
to play with the same weapons all the
time<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:44.739> prefer<00:03:45.739> changing<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.220> up<00:03:46.280> quite

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
time and I prefer changing it up quite

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.680 
time and I prefer changing it up quite
often<00:03:48.010> another<00:03:49.010> kill<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:53.030> air<00:03:53.120> here<00:03:53.420> at<00:03:53.540> that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
often another kill the air here at that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.440 
often another kill the air here at that
part<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.139> stuck<00:03:55.099> here<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.760> long<00:03:56.150> time<00:03:56.420> and

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
part we stuck here for a long time and

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.180 
part we stuck here for a long time and
in<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.900> end<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.200> think<00:03:57.370> every<00:03:58.370> lost<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:59.030> match

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
in the end I think every lost that match

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.030 
in the end I think every lost that match
because<00:04:01.190> no<00:04:02.000> one<00:04:02.180> shot<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:03.590> could<00:04:03.769> manage

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
because no one shot that we could manage

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.670 
because no one shot that we could manage
to<00:04:04.310> shoot<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.819> helicopter<00:04:05.690> attack

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
to shoot that helicopter attack

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.199 
to shoot that helicopter attack
helicopter<00:04:07.370> down<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:09.609> just<00:04:10.609> destroyed<00:04:11.060> us

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
helicopter down and just destroyed us

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.159 
helicopter down and just destroyed us
with<00:04:11.419> that<00:04:11.569> helicopter<00:04:12.169> to<00:04:12.290> help<00:04:12.910> match<00:04:14.169> hmm

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
with that helicopter to help match hmm

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.500 
with that helicopter to help match hmm
that<00:04:16.010> joint<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.489> came<00:04:16.700> off<00:04:16.820> pretty<00:04:17.180> late<00:04:17.450> so

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that joint that came off pretty late so

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.600 
that joint that came off pretty late so
I<00:04:20.769> couldn't<00:04:21.769> do<00:04:21.950> anything<00:04:22.190> about<00:04:22.430> that

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
I couldn't do anything about that

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.430 
I couldn't do anything about that
chopper<00:04:24.849> think<00:04:25.849> you're<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> die<00:04:26.289> it<00:04:27.289> was

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
actually quite good that I died here

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.399 
actually quite good that I died here
because<00:04:30.789> now<00:04:31.789> you<00:04:31.849> see<00:04:32.240> unless<00:04:32.870> kill<00:04:33.110> streak

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
because now you see unless kill streak

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.730 
because now you see unless kill streak
and<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.860> spawn<00:04:34.599> at<00:04:35.599> my<00:04:35.780> squad<00:04:36.110> mate<00:04:36.289> who<00:04:36.590> was
