now as you can see there's like they

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
now as you can see there's like they
look<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.410> same<00:02:16.650> sort<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.580> emblems<00:02:18.000> over

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
look like the same sort of emblems over

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.540 
look like the same sort of emblems over
and<00:02:18.450> over<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.810> rows<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> notice<00:02:20.340> they

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and over in rows but if you notice they

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.370 
and over in rows but if you notice they
start<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.030> change<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.690> so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
start to change a little bit so

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.050 
start to change a little bit so
obviously<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.520> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.849> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
obviously what this is going to be is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
obviously what this is going to be is
there's<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.540> about<00:02:25.200> five<00:02:25.740> different

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
there's going to be about five different

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.940 
there's going to be about five different
kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.910> leagues<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.660> go<00:02:27.780> into<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
kind of leagues that you can go into the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.580 
kind of leagues that you can go into the
better<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.549> then<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.329> up<00:02:30.629> or<00:02:31.079> down<00:02:31.110> in

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
better you do then you go up or down in

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
better you do then you go up or down in
the<00:02:31.680> league<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.239> way<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.450> think<00:02:33.510> about

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the league so a good way to think about

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.420 
the league so a good way to think about
this<00:02:33.870> is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
this is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.530 
this is
I<00:02:34.519> don't<00:02:34.849> know<00:02:34.909> how<00:02:35.030> many<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.390> guys<00:02:35.480> are

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
know they have different divisions

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.740 
know they have different divisions
there's<00:02:40.310> first<00:02:40.519> division<00:02:40.939> 2nd<00:02:41.329> division<00:02:41.420> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
there's first division 2nd division and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.209 
there's first division 2nd division and
then<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.109> regular<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.769> know<00:02:42.890> pro

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
then just a regular you know pro

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.059 
then just a regular you know pro
division<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.319> way<00:02:45.469> that<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.769> rank

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
division and so the way that you rank

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.709 
division and so the way that you rank
yourself<00:02:46.189> up<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:46.760> more<00:02:46.939> experience<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.510> get
