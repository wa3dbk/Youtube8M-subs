00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 yes then dries meters 7 goals 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.490
 tonight from van I think the nicest 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 the all flys too 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 your second yes yes I think so as 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
 pretty nice goal but I think so 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.540
 every goal had something nicely played out 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.609
 goals and yes everyone wanted to score and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 then you saw yours full 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.380
 daring bravado in a competition that is on 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.240
 that moment also had everything to all door 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 to show feed from all drills because after 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 laboriously has the hour at which you spend a lot 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 maria created opportunities and did not score 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 it was that last hour it was 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.800
 price shooting yes mother I would call 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 think we played a very good game 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 good very good 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 from football very well will be busy 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.379
 only you get a little less chance 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.969
 because they play very defensively 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.559
 You then create those opportunities that you get 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 don't finish that is the problem 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 but make second head can both it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.780
 that is very good 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 yes with a monster score the audience 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.899
 the banks 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 and players and full satisfy you now 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.410
 dressing room come true 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 yes of course here you go to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
 national team is always nice to be like this 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 to go to national team and I think 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.810
 that everyone has everyone around 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.460
 to play there too 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 now you can indicate the moment during 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.600
 websites where the button was turned 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 and we suddenly took advantage of the opportunities 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.670
 and that it is such a big gala performance 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.560
 again just went away 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 2020 anyway if you make the two zero 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.580
 then you know you just 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.620
 risk can play balls tight can 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.460
 here midfield and everything to play 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.920
 can play for 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 think that thing that certainly had important 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.280
 moment or are therefore a pity that we 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.790
 that do not only make the first half 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.140
 but things are good out enough yes 7 0 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.440
 gram might be 12 0 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.850
 it's your umpteenth monster score 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.500
 what is the explanation for you that they 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.170
 so many psv matches this season 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 So I want to end a massive scores will 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.350
 you are not completely isolated 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 the competition 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.100
 no that's right I think we are a whole 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.590
 good team janice where ahead 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 and if we can get them from there 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.800
 can play football and you saw that 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.990
 hence people we have had to come 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.149
 and know you know we're taking 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.520
 get room that are good at it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.989
 it now has national team then comes there 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.590
 a block of 3 interesting matches 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.360
 and vitesse fc utrecht and ajax are those 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.560
 crucial competitions 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.810
 yes those are the competition that the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.400
 blanket must stand there and have last year 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.530
 seen if you don't lose matches 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970
 then and then you don't pass so we know 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.989
 what we stand for and we know what 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.670
 must do 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.950
 well this was new falling excellent 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.269
 general yes was a very good diet 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.890
 in repeating alone everyone has to 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.600
 sharp enough are those competitions 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.640
 that may come 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.290
 that will happen yes then we will 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.290
 Here we go all in definitely say
