00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 voice assistant apple finally 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.000
 learned to speak great and mighty 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 however, before the official release of this 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.390
 ios version when it can be 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.029
 install on each device yet 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 must wait however install a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 with your Russian siren and device you can 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 right now and start bringing in a little 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.630
 clarity 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.940
 for someone this information will seem 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.520
 not new but for someone will be quite 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 useful and so the latest version of ios on 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.440
 which available jailbreak on this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.210
 moment this system with an index of 8 12 at 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 any update or restore 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 firmware via aytyuns 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.989
 you get an operating system 82 on 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.730
 which is not yet hacked but to get 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 Russian Syria you need to install 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.520
 and with 83 public beta 1 if you want 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.980
 do downgrade then you can do 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 its only on with 82 on which I recall 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 no jailbreak and so for installation 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 beta with russian siri us 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.110
 need a special profile on 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 currently you can download it from 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.810
 a large number of sources I decided 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 use the familiar flexter service 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.960
 installation instructions for this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 I will place the applications in the video description 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 so by running plextor 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 we will see a special banner which 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.720
 allows you to quickly go to the installation 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.150

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 firmware will depend on speed 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.960
 your internet and workload 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.680

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.149
