00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, you were the one if you are mine 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 Dear viewer and iphone users and 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.660
 you have a lot of Cossacks in your wallet 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 any papers you want to collect it all 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.009
 case in a month im iphone in one place that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.020
 he got to give these to the address I'll 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 Now something show our partner and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.199
 store aki. Yuri continues to delight 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.300
 me with my covers 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.740
 and I tell you about these covers 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 Today we have a case on the review 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.080
 this is a book cover let's not talk 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.500
 for iphone 5 and iphone 5s case 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.930
 let's start better accessories prices 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.149
 apple equipment in a partner store 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 . 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 let's open the box with the cover book 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 or the whole thing opens up somehow 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.460
 way and you are all there are boxes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 after the box there is nothing even there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 below that is, respectively, as you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 saw now there is nothing but only 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.780
 this case and that's all there is in this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 thing we can remove and let's now 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.850
 look at the very appearance of the cover in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 The case is like a prototype of this iPhone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 from paper so that we understand how to insert 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 how it should look right and what 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 In general, this case in terms of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.320
 functional in yourself let's 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.080
 shove in iphone 5s 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 here in this case we take iphone we take 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 case and the whole thing is inserted here 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 here here on top that is for all is under construction 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 very simple and fast in principle also 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.549
 and you can get here is this red Thing 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.159
 need to shove under the iphone so that the iphone 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.990
 accidentally did not look the only thing 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.549
 bad in this case is that there is no cutout 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.680
 camera to take a picture is taken 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 get an iphone from here and take a picture 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.390
 because the phone is back that is here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.790
 In principle, we all have an iphone in a case 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.500
 access to the front camera that is if we 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.659
 let us suppose a little lower iphone 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 Apparently he is now fully now 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.540
 access to the camera access to the buttons 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 these buttons are drawn here and there 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.880
 access to the noise switch in it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.409
 switch silent gum so 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.390
 here it is called and overcame the buttons 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.630
 home and here this connector is really not 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 slightly crooked but nevertheless 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.960
 if we want this functionality we can 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.420
 here stuff all kinds of cards 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.290
 optionally bank cards go here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.320
 pelvis us 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.600
 here you can shove a couple bill and 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.570
 accordingly, such a case with 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.390
 cards and with our iphone weight 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.330
 such as somewhere to go, how as a 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.640
 option, in principle, a very good and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.010
 On this all such a case it is on the site 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 our partner shop hands. yuri then 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.390
 have to go there all the servants look in 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 the description for this video in this can 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.300
 finish swami was paying us here 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.350
