00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.220
 some see it wide to cavenaghi das and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 I want the input of most of the 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.590
 wide I want to say at the outset that a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.200
 scorer can be wide a scorer 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.750
 by the hook and you will know is that when 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.970
 let's review the plays that he had 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.919
 fit and eventually the stick 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.540
 there is mounting some indication 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.180
 started with the right foot the peeling had 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.759
 finished one year a group started with foot 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.130
 right the year began the year in the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.190
 summer and remember the classics and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.570
 lanzini the one who walked very well the first 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 River time was the best river 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.210
 had many variants arrived by all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 sides deserved the goal before it fell 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.679
 that furious right of ponzio and but 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 he also showed what the river had 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.140
 as shortcomings some uncouples 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.989
 defensive to a difficulty to generate 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 a little more fluency of game without 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.659
 However, the first presentation of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.040
 up in the camp is good I say 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.930
 the next we just saw 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080
 cavenaghi to keep chatting about 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.080
 this question that we seem 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.820
 bite some I insist on the size 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.920
 of chain and on the presence of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.680
 cavenaghi this is very good from teo 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.930
 Then they commit a mistake in the blunder. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.330
 it has nothing to do with the anchor but 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.500
 excuse the bar and the bar to be in the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.680
 party and does not have to that during another 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.930
 photon at the beginning 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.930
 the permit is late the defender 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.299
 jonatan maidana is not one of those who pretend 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.159
 maidana does not give me the feeling that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.520
 want to have taken advantage of those 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.890
 circumstances in this play with good 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.789
 action in a first stage of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 augusto solari replacer of saithe 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.570
 he made a variant because he will depend 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.149
 a lot of what the flyers do 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.340
 external attention with the attention attention 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.750
 with the maneuver because a footballer who 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.399
 had been observed they told him 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.399
 our companions on the playing field 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.619
 of average distance ponzio normally you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.230
 stick outside test out and make 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.200
 very well after he explained that this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 look and this observation and this this is 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.350
 for you for you for I have given 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.390
 for challenging voice had to do with 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.740
 who had been a recipient of some 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.510
 whistles and that in any case there was 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.510
 had loosened let's say he had aligned 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.900
 what happens is that ponzio has changed 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.209
 his performances 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.640
 throughout the last months of being 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.829
 a tablet for the selection among the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.790
 has a downer that made the fans 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.340
 river will throw them at the end again not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.590
 had gymnastic responded in the second 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.230
 time I do not think it left him alive 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.290
 the whole game when the result is 1 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.019
 to 0 here could have been increased 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.060
 a good reflection in the pique and in the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.620
 attempt to chop the ball previously 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.180
 auction I think there is some influence 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.560
 I insist on that that mortifies some 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.900
 river fans who see it anchovy 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.900
 chain and here in any case fails in the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.370
 definition fails in aim but 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 has nothing to do with that time 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 have one 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.340
 with half a kilo whatever it is of more 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340
 medals
