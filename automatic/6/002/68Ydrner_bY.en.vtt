 not like I'm back to ex angie 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.340
 from bollywood kitchen and we're going 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.510
 make a recipe that you have 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.100
 acclaimed on the internet 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.300
 the first time in the generics 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.100
 so finally you golden times for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 you today with an expert from the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.520
 Indian cuisine and after we go 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.039
 run the ingredients right away 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.630
 for the recipe 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.140
 so we're going to have some chicken so 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 chose double thighs note one 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 little vegetable oil of lemon 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.900
 tandoori spices of garlic and ginger 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.290
 and a small bonus we will accompany 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.300
 our hen and a sauce sauce 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.690
 with yogurt with coriander 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.240
 so we have yogurt coriander 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.380
 Greek Grétry cumin and lime 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.660
 so I'm going to make incisions in 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.040
 our hen is for that marinade that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.050
 you are preparing to become impregnated 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.670
 well in the flesh so that will allow 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.810
 of banat shearer simply the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.930
 charge and for the super car is 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.500
 perfect and so I'm trying to 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.140
 to take care of ginger and line so 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:19.270
 we're going to mix that in a dish with 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 the yogurt oil i'm going to squeeze 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.360
 also so the lime and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.909
 add tandoori spices 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.190
 here we mix all that and we go 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.190
 arrange the chicken breasts in 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.380
 so now that you've managed seven 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 maryland we'll be able to come well 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.040
 impregnated our hen is so the idea if 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.900
 unpleasant to have this way in there 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.880
 I am good and as improper side 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.180
 thank you had for the show what we 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 would do so here's hop we learn eyes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.400
 well and so we keep it cool 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 before cooking yes so ideally for 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.150
 that the marinade impregnates itself well 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 shares over at least an hour to an hour 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.020
 and if not one night it's possible yes a 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.440
 night with simone at the world and then 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.440
 otherwise ideally 3 4 and that's it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.820
 good then there is attacking the cooking and then 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.500
 chicken after marinating left 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.300
 so kill him features on one on one 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.220
 grid with Iranian paper goes so 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.580
 the hot oven of 120 degrees 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.660
 the very hot hot furnace created is 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.000
 rather in the upper part of the fund 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.410
 while from the course there the idea 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.660
 really it is that its grid 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:47.269
 is it okay how long 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:48.769
 cooking way so 110 during our 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.630
 hen is redeeming the fort 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.140
 what we want is a Hairdo 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.030
