00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.260 

I've<00:00:03.950> had<00:00:04.100> this<00:00:04.220> boss<00:00:04.460> blues<00:00:04.760> driver<00:00:05.029> sitting

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
I've had this boss blues driver sitting

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.550 
I've had this boss blues driver sitting
around<00:00:05.510> for<00:00:05.779> a<00:00:05.840> while<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.170> I<00:00:06.230> thought<00:00:06.410> it

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
around for a while and I thought it

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.600 
around for a while and I thought it
would<00:00:06.680> do<00:00:07.549> some<00:00:07.759> modifications<00:00:08.420> on<00:00:08.540> it<00:00:08.780> and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
would do some modifications on it and

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.549 
would do some modifications on it and
since<00:00:10.610> there's<00:00:11.330> a<00:00:11.389> lot<00:00:11.420> of<00:00:11.660> demos<00:00:11.809> online<00:00:12.110> that

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
since there's a lot of demos online that

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.320 
since there's a lot of demos online that
show<00:00:12.799> you<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.100> modded<00:00:13.430> pedal<00:00:13.699> and<00:00:13.910> then<00:00:14.240> they

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
show you the modded pedal and then they

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.850 
show you the modded pedal and then they
kind<00:00:14.510> of<00:00:14.539> compare<00:00:14.719> it<00:00:14.900> side-by-side<00:00:14.959> with<00:00:15.709> the

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
kind of compare it side-by-side with the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.980 
kind of compare it side-by-side with the
original<00:00:16.250> one<00:00:16.430> what<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:16.940> decided<00:00:17.360> to<00:00:17.510> do<00:00:17.720> was

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990

show you play the original one and then
show<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:21.920> one<00:00:22.250> mod<00:00:22.490> at<00:00:22.670> a<00:00:22.700> time<00:00:22.940> so<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:23.210> far<00:00:23.420> it

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
show you one mod at a time so so far it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.450 
show you one mod at a time so so far it
hasn't<00:00:23.630> been<00:00:23.810> modded<00:00:24.260> I'm<00:00:24.650> gonna<00:00:24.890> play<00:00:25.430> a

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
hasn't been modded I'm gonna play a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.690 
hasn't been modded I'm gonna play a
little<00:00:25.670> bit<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.060> then<00:00:26.890> I'm<00:00:27.890> gonna<00:00:28.010> do<00:00:28.280> one<00:00:28.490> mod

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
little bit and then I'm gonna do one mod

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.130 
little bit and then I'm gonna do one mod
which<00:00:28.910> is<00:00:29.030> supposed<00:00:29.270> to<00:00:29.360> increase<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.930> bass

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
which is supposed to increase the bass

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.979 
which is supposed to increase the bass
which<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.680> changing<00:00:31.369> capacitor<00:00:32.090> number<00:00:32.329> 14<00:00:32.719> so

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
which is changing capacitor number 14 so

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.200 
which is changing capacitor number 14 so
here's<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.070> pedal<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.550> sounds<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:34.969> now

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
here's the pedal what it sounds like now

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.880 
here's the pedal what it sounds like now
before<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.840> mod<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.290> then<00:00:36.350> I'll<00:00:36.500> give<00:00:36.739> you<00:00:36.860> a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
before the mod and then I'll give you a

00:00:36.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
before the mod and then I'll give you a
demo<00:00:37.850> after

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.590 

next<00:01:35.259> thing<00:01:35.380> I'll<00:01:35.500> change<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.600> tone

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
next thing I'll change is the tone

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840 
next thing I'll change is the tone
control<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:39.040> capacitor<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.670> tone

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
control the capacitor on the tone

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.460 
control the capacitor on the tone
control<00:01:40.210> because<00:01:40.479> anybody<00:01:40.840> who's<00:01:41.110> played<00:01:41.259> one

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
control because anybody who's played one

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.990 
control because anybody who's played one
of<00:01:41.560> these<00:01:41.649> knows<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.220> frequency<00:01:42.850> range

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
of these knows that the frequency range

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.020 
of these knows that the frequency range
in<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.270> thing<00:01:43.479> is<00:01:43.600> pretty<00:01:43.750> hideous<00:01:45.030> right

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030
