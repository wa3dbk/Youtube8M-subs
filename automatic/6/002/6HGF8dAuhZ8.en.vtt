excitement<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.820> legitimately<00:02:35.030> thought<00:02:35.840> we

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
excitement we legitimately thought we

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.620 
excitement we legitimately thought we
had<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> shot<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.680> make<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.860> playoffs<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.239> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
had a shot to make the playoffs and it I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.840 
had a shot to make the playoffs and it I
think<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.290> took<00:02:39.500> those<00:02:39.709> first<00:02:40.190> four<00:02:40.370> years<00:02:40.670> to

think it took those first four years to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.960 
think it took those first four years to
learn<00:02:41.000> what<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.360> took<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.750> win<00:02:42.640> okay<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.820> those

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
learn what it took to win okay in those

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.520
