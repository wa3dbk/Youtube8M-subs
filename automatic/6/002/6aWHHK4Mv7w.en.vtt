of your guys about just a few minutes
ago<00:02:59.750> he<00:03:00.020> says<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.410> got<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> problem<00:03:00.830> around<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
ago he says I got a problem around the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.590 
ago he says I got a problem around the
frame<00:03:01.580> there's<00:03:01.820> air<00:03:02.000> coming<00:03:02.300> around<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
frame there's air coming around the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.290 
frame there's air coming around the
frame<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.590> easy<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.190> $3<00:03:04.790> tube<00:03:05.090> of

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
frame that is so easy to $3 tube of

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.760 
frame that is so easy to $3 tube of
caulk<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.990> almost<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.620> least

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
caulk just the almost the least

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.770 
caulk just the almost the least
expensive<00:03:07.190> clock<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.550> can<00:03:07.730> get<00:03:07.910> cut<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> tip

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
expensive clock you can get cut the tip

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.060 
expensive clock you can get cut the tip
off<00:03:08.960> you<00:03:09.170> don't<00:03:09.320> have<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.740> gun<00:03:09.920> or

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
off you don't have to have the gun or

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.620 
off you don't have to have the gun or
anything<00:03:10.220> like<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.490> just<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:11.180> around<00:03:11.390> the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
anything like that just go around the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.030 
anything like that just go around the
frame<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.990> window<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.680> stuff<00:03:12.920> is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
frame of the window this stuff is

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.910 
frame of the window this stuff is
paintable<00:03:13.430> within<00:03:13.760> 30<00:03:14.000> minutes<00:03:14.240> but<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.630> also

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
paintable within 30 minutes but it also

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.140 
paintable within 30 minutes but it also
deteriorates<00:03:15.920> after<00:03:16.280> five<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.700> ten<00:03:16.880> years<00:03:17.120> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
deteriorates after five to ten years so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.030 
deteriorates after five to ten years so
you<00:03:17.300> need<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.540> check<00:03:17.720> those<00:03:17.930> even<00:03:18.320> newer

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you need to check those even newer

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560 
you need to check those even newer
windows<00:03:19.520> that<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.730> put<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.000> fight<00:03:20.210> it<00:03:20.360> if<00:03:20.450> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
windows that you put in fight it if you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.270 
windows that you put in fight it if you
have<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> five<00:03:21.020> or<00:03:21.050> six<00:03:21.230> year<00:03:21.440> old<00:03:21.650> house<00:03:21.800> that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
have a five or six year old house that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.100 
have a five or six year old house that
that<00:03:22.310> corks<00:03:22.910> probably<00:03:23.240> getting<00:03:23.450> old<00:03:23.600> yeah<00:03:23.900> you

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
that corks probably getting old yeah you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.630 
that corks probably getting old yeah you
just<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:24.620> go<00:03:24.740> check<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.280> if<00:03:25.400> you've<00:03:25.520> got

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
just you just go check and if you've got

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.160 
just you just go check and if you've got
something<00:03:26.000> that's<00:03:26.120> peeling<00:03:26.420> away<00:03:26.630> or<00:03:26.840> fading

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
something that's peeling away or fading

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.990 
something that's peeling away or fading
away<00:03:27.260> cracking<00:03:27.950> anything<00:03:28.220> like<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.910> go

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
away cracking anything like that just go

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.670 
away cracking anything like that just go
around<00:03:29.210> with<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.570> $2<00:03:29.900> tube<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.230> caulk<00:03:30.410> okay

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
around with the $2 tube of caulk okay

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.260 
around with the $2 tube of caulk okay
can<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:30.860> tell<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.190> why<00:03:31.340> shied<00:03:31.670> away<00:03:31.700> from<00:03:31.910> doing

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
can I tell you why shied away from doing

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.270 
can I tell you why shied away from doing

it because sure I have this feeling I'm

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.100 
it because sure I have this feeling I'm
gonna<00:03:34.400> mess<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.790> up<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:35.300> gonna<00:03:35.540> I'm<00:03:35.810> gonna<00:03:35.900> get

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
gonna mess it up I'm gonna I'm gonna get

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.930 
gonna mess it up I'm gonna I'm gonna get
the<00:03:36.260> beat<00:03:36.470> all<00:03:36.740> wrong<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.460> it's<00:03:37.550> just<00:03:37.790> gonna

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
the beat all wrong and it's just gonna

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.490 
the beat all wrong and it's just gonna
turn<00:03:38.210> into<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.450> disaster<00:03:38.960> right<00:03:39.050> now<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.380> so

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
turn into a disaster right now it's so

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.320 
turn into a disaster right now it's so
easy<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.860> caveman<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.520> use<00:03:40.670> right<00:03:40.970> that's<00:03:41.180> so

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
easy a caveman can use right that's so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.150 
easy a caveman can use right that's so
that's<00:03:41.570> what<00:03:41.690> we<00:03:41.780> say<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.200> it's<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.800> simple

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
that's what we say it's it's so simple

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.880 
that's what we say it's it's so simple
and<00:03:43.550> it's<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.270> inexpensive<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:45.260> like<00:03:45.800> I

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and it's really inexpensive I like I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.770 
and it's really inexpensive I like I
said<00:03:45.950> every<00:03:46.340> project<00:03:46.520> we've<00:03:46.850> shown<00:03:47.060> here<00:03:47.300> less

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
said every project we've shown here less

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.570 
said every project we've shown here less
than<00:03:48.020> ten<00:03:48.200> dollars<00:03:48.380> less<00:03:48.860> than<00:03:48.890> ten<00:03:49.280> minutes

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
than ten dollars less than ten minutes

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.650 
than ten dollars less than ten minutes
you<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.120> know<00:03:50.209> what<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.420> do<00:03:50.510> okay

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
you just have to know what to do okay

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.610 
you just have to know what to do okay
before<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.900> let<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.110> go<00:03:51.170> let's<00:03:51.350> talk<00:03:51.500> about

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.600 
attic insulation mm-hmm how do you know
when<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.840> need<00:03:53.990> more<00:03:54.290> other<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.890> peak<00:03:55.280> up<00:03:55.459> in

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
go across the joists if your insulation

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.760 
go across the joists if your insulation
is<00:04:02.209> matted<00:04:02.540> down<00:04:02.690> below<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.350> top<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.709> the
