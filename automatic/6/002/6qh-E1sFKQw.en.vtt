00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
wizard which I consider a great chiller

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.600 
wizard which I consider a great chiller
and<00:01:14.740> pump<00:01:15.100> in<00:01:15.310> one<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:18.070> been<00:01:18.310> very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
and pump in one that's been very

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.650

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
efficient it has cut my chilling time

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.830 
efficient it has cut my chilling time
basically<00:01:22.660> in<00:01:22.780> half<00:01:23.020> versus<00:01:23.530> emergency<00:01:24.340> look

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
basically in half versus emergency look

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.570 
basically in half versus emergency look
easily<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:25.960> half

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
easily in half

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.590
