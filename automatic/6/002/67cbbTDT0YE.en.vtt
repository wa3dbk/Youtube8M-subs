00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the ship earthquake and now we need to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.710 
the ship earthquake and now we need to
go<00:00:14.940> back<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.630> fiery<00:00:15.870> airdog<00:00:16.350> again<00:00:17.570> it's<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
go back to the fiery airdog again it's a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
go back to the fiery airdog again it's a
lot<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.650> forth<00:00:19.949> right<00:00:20.160> now

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
lot of going back and forth right now

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.210 
lot of going back and forth right now
but<00:00:21.480> we're<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.980> we're<00:00:23.100> done

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
but we're just about I think we're done

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.839 
but we're just about I think we're done
with<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:25.949> destroy<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
with that for now and we can destroy the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:56.650 
with that for now and we can destroy the
first<00:00:27.090> shield<00:00:27.510> generator

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.960 

well<00:00:57.230> let's<00:00:58.130> see

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.640 

there's<00:01:01.970> no<00:01:02.360> upgrade<00:01:02.810> I<00:01:02.840> can<00:01:03.110> think<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.470> that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
there's no upgrade I can think of that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.530 
there's no upgrade I can think of that
we<00:01:03.770> can<00:01:03.950> get<00:01:04.130> right<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:06.550> right<00:01:07.550> here<00:01:07.790> nothing

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
we can get right now right here nothing

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.630 
we can get right now right here nothing
so<00:01:08.870> this<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.830> just<00:01:09.890> gonna<00:01:10.040> be<00:01:10.250> really<00:01:10.400> quick

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
so this is just gonna be really quick

so this is just gonna be really quick
we're<00:01:10.970> gonna<00:01:11.090> go<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.780> generator<00:01:12.260> come

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
we're gonna go to the generator come

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.090 
we're gonna go to the generator come
back<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.000> hopefully<00:01:14.780> get<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.290> forest

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
just not much to describe right now but

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.880 
just not much to describe right now but
did<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.480> know<00:02:34.630> pirate<00:02:35.050> activity<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.860> area

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
did you know pirate activity in the area

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.310 
did you know pirate activity in the area
has<00:02:36.220> increased<00:02:36.820> their<00:02:37.330> more<00:02:37.600> prior<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.140> than

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
has increased their more prior to than

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.010 
has increased their more prior to than
last<00:02:38.500> time<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.670> still<00:02:43.000> they're<00:02:43.330> really<00:02:43.690> not<00:02:43.960> a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
last time but still they're really not a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.250 
last time but still they're really not a
threat<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.360> apparently<00:02:46.360> they<00:02:46.690> decided<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
threat but apparently they decided to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.370 
threat but apparently they decided to
construct<00:02:47.740> eternity<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.870> can't<00:02:50.350> use

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
construct eternity and now we can't use

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.550 
construct eternity and now we can't use
the<00:02:50.590> elevator<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.270> we<00:02:52.450> can't<00:02:52.720> use<00:02:53.410> our

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the elevator and we can't use our

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560 
the elevator and we can't use our
missiles<00:02:53.800> for<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.250> ship<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.760> destroy<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
missiles for the ship to destroy the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.250 
missiles for the ship to destroy the
turret<00:02:56.370> unless<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.610> disable<00:02:58.600> pork<00:02:58.870> jamming

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
turret unless we disable pork jamming

turret unless we disable pork jamming
devices<00:02:59.500> judges<00:03:00.340> dig<00:03:01.140> now<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.200> can

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
devices judges dig now we can

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.540 
devices judges dig now we can
there<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.960> go<00:03:05.210> here<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.330> comes

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
little while as well as

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.330 
little while as well as
the<00:05:35.980> other<00:05:36.130> place<00:05:36.400> we<00:05:36.640> left<00:05:36.850> at<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.240> beginning

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340

so<00:05:39.340> yeah<00:05:39.520> really<00:05:40.030> no<00:05:41.700> point<00:05:42.700> of<00:05:42.820> we're<00:05:43.510> not

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
so yeah really no point of we're not

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.170 
so yeah really no point of we're not
really<00:05:43.840> going<00:05:44.080> back<00:05:44.260> there<00:05:44.640> until<00:05:45.640> way<00:05:45.910> later

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
really going back there until way later

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.120 
really going back there until way later
in<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.480> game<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:50.350> next<00:05:50.530> place<00:05:50.650> if<00:05:51.010> I'm

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
in the game so the next place if I'm

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.010 
in the game so the next place if I'm
correct<00:05:51.250> as<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.880> said<00:05:52.090> earlier<00:05:52.360> I<00:05:52.450> think<00:05:52.660> is

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
correct as I said earlier I think is

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.830 
correct as I said earlier I think is
storing<00:05:53.470> jungles<00:05:54.450> openly

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
storing jungles openly

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.780 
storing jungles openly
