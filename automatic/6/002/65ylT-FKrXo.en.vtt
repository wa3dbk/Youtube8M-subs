00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
so I did a modification his legs

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
so I did a modification his legs
primarily<00:00:52.500> consist<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.539> parts<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
primarily consist of the parts from that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
primarily consist of the parts from that
a<00:00:55.649> few<00:00:56.520> zip<00:00:56.699> ties<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.420> local<00:00:57.660> hardware

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a few zip ties from your local hardware

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.029 
a few zip ties from your local hardware
store<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> real<00:01:00.719> quick<00:01:00.989> though<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> guys

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
store so real quick though so you guys

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
store so real quick though so you guys
understand<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.910> big<00:01:03.239> he<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.589> here's<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
understand how big he is here's a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.780 
understand how big he is here's a
comparison<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.650> evasion<00:01:07.650> mode<00:01:07.799> Optimus

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
comparison this is evasion mode Optimus

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.170 
comparison this is evasion mode Optimus
Prime<00:01:12.500> he's<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> lot<00:01:13.770> better<00:01:14.010> his<00:01:14.610> legs<00:01:14.939> don't

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
Prime he's a lot better his legs don't

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.109 
Prime he's a lot better his legs don't
look<00:01:15.770> too<00:01:16.770> short<00:01:17.570> or<00:01:18.570> too<00:01:19.560> long<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.759> opinion

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
look too short or too long in my opinion

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.620 
look too short or too long in my opinion
I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.540> actually<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.170> size<00:01:23.630> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I think it's actually the right size and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.440 
I think it's actually the right size and
here<00:01:25.619> he<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.740> compared<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> deluxe<00:01:26.820> figure

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.520 

so<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:32.299> think<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.600> shapes<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.290> pretty

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so I think he actually shapes up pretty

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.999 
so I think he actually shapes up pretty
well<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> exact<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.930> better<00:01:37.530> scale

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
well and to get the exact a better scale

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
well and to get the exact a better scale
it<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> regular<00:01:39.659> sized<00:01:39.960> Voyager<00:01:42.530> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it here is a regular sized Voyager so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
it here is a regular sized Voyager so
he's<00:01:43.680> about<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.220> same<00:01:44.399> size<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.240> he's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
he's about the same size I think he's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.670 
he's about the same size I think he's
maybe<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.970> he's<00:01:47.970> about<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:48.600> size<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
maybe what he's about the same size so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480 
maybe what he's about the same size so
there<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:51.439> like<00:01:52.439> him<00:01:52.860> he's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> little

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
there we go I like him he's a little

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.200 
there we go I like him he's a little

to<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> these<00:02:12.690> screwdrivers

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to do I use one of these screwdrivers

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:27.110 
to do I use one of these screwdrivers
you<00:02:15.180> use<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.709> want<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> use

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120

and<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.659> want<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.870> use<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.739> small<00:02:31.590> flathead

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
and you want to use the small flathead

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740 
and you want to use the small flathead
that<00:02:33.310> comes<00:02:33.549> in<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> set<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.269> comes<00:02:34.450> with<00:02:34.720> a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
that comes in the set it comes with a

that comes in the set it comes with a
set<00:02:35.019> of<00:02:35.200> three<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.769> four<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:38.080> pretty<00:02:38.500> easy

being<00:06:32.800> like<00:06:33.580> this<00:06:34.060> where<00:06:34.690> it's<00:06:34.960> all<00:06:35.969> you<00:06:36.969> know

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
being like this where it's all you know

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.580 
being like this where it's all you know
not<00:06:37.300> touching<00:06:37.779> this<00:06:37.900> stuff<00:06:38.020> you<00:06:38.289> can<00:06:38.409> actually

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
not touching this stuff you can actually

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.379 
not touching this stuff you can actually
give<00:06:39.129> them<00:06:39.219> ankle<00:06:39.520> tilt<00:06:39.930> so<00:06:40.930> it's<00:06:41.650> a<00:06:41.770> easy<00:06:41.949> mod

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
give them ankle tilt so it's a easy mod

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.899 
give them ankle tilt so it's a easy mod
my<00:06:43.389> recommendation<00:06:44.169> is<00:06:44.409> use<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:45.129> I<00:06:45.520> think

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
my recommendation is use the I think

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.290 
my recommendation is use the I think
this<00:06:46.120> is<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.419> leg<00:06:46.949> right<00:06:47.949> here<00:06:48.090> this<00:06:49.090> is<00:06:49.150> the

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
this is the leg right here this is the

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.589 
this is the leg right here this is the
foot<00:06:49.629> and<00:06:51.029> this<00:06:52.029> is<00:06:52.330> the<00:06:53.460> arm<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:54.940> believe<00:06:55.330> and

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
foot and this is the arm I believe and

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.559 
foot and this is the arm I believe and
then<00:06:55.779> I<00:06:56.169> had<00:06:56.919> it<00:06:57.069> with<00:06:57.370> I<00:06:57.699> had<00:06:58.060> some<00:06:58.210> duct<00:06:58.389> tape

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
then I had it with I had some duct tape

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.719 
then I had it with I had some duct tape
on<00:06:58.779> there<00:06:59.050> too<00:06:59.349> just<00:06:59.650> to<00:06:59.919> see<00:07:00.310> if<00:07:00.400> it<00:07:00.490> looked

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
on there too just to see if it looked

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.920 
on there too just to see if it looked
good<00:07:01.259> and<00:07:02.259> well<00:07:03.009> it<00:07:03.219> did<00:07:03.460> so<00:07:03.789> I<00:07:04.060> thought<00:07:04.479> well

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
good and well it did so I thought well

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.439 
good and well it did so I thought well
how<00:07:05.529> could<00:07:05.710> I<00:07:05.830> get<00:07:05.889> it<00:07:06.099> to<00:07:06.190> stay<00:07:06.460> I<00:07:06.729> used<00:07:07.270> some

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
how could I get it to stay I used some

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.490 
how could I get it to stay I used some
zip<00:07:07.659> ties<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:09.490> only<00:07:10.060> need<00:07:10.509> to<00:07:10.690> use<00:07:10.719> two<00:07:11.289> on

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
zip ties you only need to use two on

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.110 
zip ties you only need to use two on
this<00:07:11.680> side<00:07:11.889> because<00:07:12.129> there's<00:07:12.520> a<00:07:12.580> little<00:07:12.849> peg

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
this side because there's a little peg

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.129 
this side because there's a little peg
and<00:07:13.449> lockdowns<00:07:14.909> leg<00:07:15.909> there<00:07:18.930> just<00:07:19.930> a<00:07:20.020> little

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
and lockdowns leg there just a little

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.059 
and lockdowns leg there just a little
peg<00:07:20.469> right<00:07:20.740> there<00:07:21.039> that<00:07:21.789> allows<00:07:22.120> him<00:07:22.479> to

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
peg right there that allows him to

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.200 
peg right there that allows him to
allows<00:07:24.069> it<00:07:24.310> to<00:07:24.339> stick<00:07:24.699> in<00:07:24.849> there<00:07:24.969> nice<00:07:25.180> and

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
allows it to stick in there nice and

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.749 
allows it to stick in there nice and
good<00:07:25.389> the<00:07:26.110> other<00:07:26.289> side<00:07:26.589> though<00:07:26.919> it<00:07:27.250> does<00:07:27.729> not

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 
good the other side though it does not

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.490 
good the other side though it does not
have<00:07:28.270> that<00:07:28.479> peg<00:07:28.750> it's<00:07:29.080> for<00:07:29.349> transformation

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
have that peg it's for transformation

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.219 
have that peg it's for transformation
and<00:07:30.400> it<00:07:30.610> doesn't<00:07:31.000> have<00:07:31.150> that<00:07:31.180> peg<00:07:31.569> right<00:07:31.839> here

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:32.229 
and it doesn't have that peg right here

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:35.459 
and it doesn't have that peg right here
so<00:07:33.069> because<00:07:33.940> of<00:07:34.089> that<00:07:34.120> you<00:07:34.900> actually<00:07:35.080> have<00:07:35.409> to

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:35.469 
so because of that you actually have to

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:38.309 
so because of that you actually have to
use<00:07:35.680> another<00:07:35.860> zip<00:07:36.310> tie<00:07:36.550> but<00:07:37.539> I<00:07:37.810> don't<00:07:37.990> think<00:07:38.229> it

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 
use another zip tie but I don't think it

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.809 
use another zip tie but I don't think it
it<00:07:38.409> takes<00:07:38.620> away<00:07:38.860> from<00:07:38.889> the<00:07:39.190> mold<00:07:39.370> too<00:07:39.610> much

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:39.819 
it takes away from the mold too much

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:42.600 
it takes away from the mold too much
black<00:07:40.719> zip<00:07:40.960> ties<00:07:40.990> where<00:07:41.500> my<00:07:41.680> preference<00:07:42.159> you

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610 
black zip ties where my preference you

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.070 
black zip ties where my preference you
can<00:07:42.639> find<00:07:42.969> gray<00:07:43.240> ones<00:07:43.479> that<00:07:43.690> might<00:07:43.810> look<00:07:43.960> a

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
can find gray ones that might look a

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.600 
can find gray ones that might look a
little<00:07:44.259> bit<00:07:44.440> better<00:07:44.589> you<00:07:45.099> might<00:07:45.400> want<00:07:45.550> to

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
little bit better you might want to

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.010 
little bit better you might want to
dirty<00:07:45.849> them<00:07:46.000> up<00:07:46.060> or<00:07:46.270> something<00:07:46.629> I<00:07:46.779> don't<00:07:46.870> know

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.020
