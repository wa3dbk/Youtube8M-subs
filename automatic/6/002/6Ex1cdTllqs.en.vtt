00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.029
 forever 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.539
 and bengoa has ended up being 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.319
 to teach the purchases he has 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.710
 in the smallest trip quique that was more inegi 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.759
 in a destination 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.329
 then I have 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.789
 well, it's good to take advantage of a foot of fire clarity 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.060
 too dark 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.310
 I'm going to finish teaching 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 the purchases of the king's boy 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.160
 discarded provoke wounded I decided to wait like this shows before 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.570
 so that you do not do too much 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.579
 before starting 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.370
 I have to say that ee 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.660
 I am fully aware that I have 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.320
 there are some pending requests 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.850
 percent at the same time for others but 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.130
 who I remember that 7 ago 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.110
 a meeting of I remove this world 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.440
 that are 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.850
 pinewood 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 smoke 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.170
 a massacre inspired by it pillar blond 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 quiter I have to say that the epre I know that I do a lot of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.189
 the trailer 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 with looks 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.140
 with the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 I was doing a little time to see if I that this magnitude of makeup 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.160
 as is 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.740
 but as I see that they happen 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 will leave the cesm the time 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.119
 percent is in what the 2 patience 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.500
 because to me sincerely he gives me four 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.810
 because my techniques are not 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 They are not the best of pinto 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 intuitively Lyon never ever done a course he has never done anything or 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.190
 professional 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.710
 this after 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 so come and put 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.310
 well simply 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.070
 the pcm comes out no shape 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.850
 to provide band 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.810
 they weigh one area above the other one little sip compared 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.180
 then that generates a lot of stick 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.410
 is always looked for any excuse to 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.580
 and maybe also that time 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.970
 to do it is that if I have to teach a young man that he has to be interviewed 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.439
 so I think I always tell them the inter do a raise in none of 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.159
 the cameras ordered but 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.519
 I ask for that patience because it means that they will watch 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.999
 But that's what there is 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
 courage for / telepress that gives me a lot of pass 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.409
 that which 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.959
 percent and we're going to what 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 the moment in which the purchases in 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.069
 Tree men 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.939
 thanks finally to all 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.369
 at the same time 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.369
 this 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.809
 the younger 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.809
 and this these complaints 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.979
 14 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.249
 percent 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.599
 this poll is to be 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.969
 the bank adds 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.419
 from Spain and have some beautiful colors 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.959
 but 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.729
 things that I do not like they love it a lot and in the end I love all of them 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.299
 origin 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.729
 I like it 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.129
 But the glitter that has seven 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.249
 If you're not careful, it falls off and down your face 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.929
 Haydee to blur Sometimes you run out of chips are small streams 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.230
 We never saw that I did not last long measurable in Durham 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.979
 well with a one preparation 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.979
 but it is not the works that I have kamasutra 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.139
 then why messi 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.840
 because apart from the colors I like they call me to can not avoid 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.479
 I bought some before and started a palette 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.170
 It gives me I do not know what to leave 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.919
 the stocking palette or mix them or whatever 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.769
 and then powers 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.220
 the ejido 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.579
 finish it from the dam the parota a little more to chillán 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.409
 it costs to believe it finally 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.419
 so 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.829
 I teach you this island 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.409
 the shadow 107 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.979
 moralito 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.679
 As you can see, it is very well painted, it paints my so and so but Marcelo Tinelli 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.859
 they already have is something that all the works of the brilliant icontec 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.610
 and good 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.919
 it costs still 5 90 that is not that they are 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.449
 incredibly cheap 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.689
 but it catches my attention in your interview 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.199
 Diego 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.910
 I see and in the end 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.039
 and for worse 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.319
 this other let's see the sector at 36 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.749
 mccourt world common 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.090
 -It was not overcome 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.090
 its bluish black 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.969
 so very akin to all consciousness 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.969
 and this one that turned 31 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.330
 that they 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.110

 you do not notice 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.499
 the quality is not 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.499
 exceedingly incredible

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.469
 In summary 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.279
 the format 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.240
