00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.530 
and okay works just fine so that is it
for<00:01:19.430> today<00:01:20.950> then<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:21.980> would<00:01:22.700> like<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.090> remember

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
for today then I would like to remember

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.040 
for today then I would like to remember
that<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.050> still<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.340> beta<00:01:25.700> driver<00:01:26.210> we

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
that this is still a beta driver we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.340 
that this is still a beta driver we
didn't<00:01:27.320> test<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.740> out<00:01:27.860> quite<00:01:29.020> perfectly<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
didn't test it out quite perfectly so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.520 
didn't test it out quite perfectly so
expect<00:01:31.070> bugs<00:01:31.660> but<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.810> can<00:01:32.960> see<00:01:33.140> we're<00:01:33.350> moving

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
expect bugs but you can see we're moving

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.290 
expect bugs but you can see we're moving
to<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.890> very<00:01:36.010> really<00:01:37.010> better<00:01:37.400> version<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to a very really better version of the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.210 
to a very really better version of the
driver<00:01:38.570> which<00:01:38.870> you<00:01:39.680> won't<00:01:39.860> be<00:01:39.950> needing

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
driver which you won't be needing

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.470 
driver which you won't be needing
anything<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:42.110> vibration<00:01:42.620> works<00:01:42.830> perfectly

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
anything the vibration works perfectly

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.140 
anything the vibration works perfectly
and<00:01:44.480> it's<00:01:45.050> now<00:01:45.230> even<00:01:45.560> closer<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.250> what<00:01:47.000> an

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
and it's now even closer to what an

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.540 
and it's now even closer to what an
official<00:01:47.930> driver<00:01:48.200> would<00:01:48.560> look<00:01:48.800> like<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.370> it

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
official driver would look like as it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.070 
official driver would look like as it
works<00:01:51.190> it's<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:53.120> just<00:01:53.360> works<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.840> just

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
works it's like it just works you just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.020 
works it's like it just works you just
install<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.520> don't<00:01:55.700> have<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.910> do

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
install that and you don't have to do

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.850 
install that and you don't have to do
anything<00:01:56.210> else<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:56.600> edit<00:01:57.110> next<00:01:57.260> in<00:01:57.500> close<00:01:57.680> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
anything else just edit next in close to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.030 
anything else just edit next in close to
every<00:01:58.100> game<00:01:58.360> which<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.540> too<00:01:59.870> bad<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.560> not<00:02:00.979> as
