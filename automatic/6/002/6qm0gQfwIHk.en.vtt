of<00:02:48.799> just<00:02:49.799> all<00:02:49.980> downstrokes<00:02:50.340> kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
of just all downstrokes kind of in that

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.119 
of just all downstrokes kind of in that
rhythm<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.299> couple<00:02:51.540> measures<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:53.040> we

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
rhythm for a couple measures then we

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.220 
rhythm for a couple measures then we
bring<00:02:53.280> it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.780 

so<00:02:58.920> you're<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.040> strumming<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.700> you're

so you're just strumming it and you're

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.930 
so you're just strumming it and you're
going<00:02:59.910> zero<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.170> zero

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
going zero to zero

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.730

after the three times are doing that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.610 
after the three times are doing that
little<00:03:10.060> figure<00:03:10.210> you<00:03:10.660> resolve<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.140> just<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.440> C

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
little figure you resolve it just a C

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.640 
little figure you resolve it just a C
major<00:03:11.800> chord

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.729 

all<00:03:16.280> right<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:17.000> we<00:03:17.090> go<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.739> b-flat

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
all right then we go to it a b-flat

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.949 
all right then we go to it a b-flat

you<00:03:20.959> have<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.260> hold<00:03:21.409> it<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.680> now<00:03:22.129> we

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
you have to hold it like this now we

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.820 
you have to hold it like this now we
have<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> full<00:03:22.760> bar<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.209> first<00:03:23.390> fret<00:03:23.830> because

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.480 

this<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.680> moving<00:03:28.950> line<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.370> there

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
this is a little moving line and there

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.190 
this is a little moving line and there
are<00:03:29.550> two<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:29.910> need<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.330> that's<00:03:30.900> done

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
on a capo de tar so we have first hit

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.240 
on a capo de tar so we have first hit
the<00:03:35.910> cord<00:03:36.240> normal<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.530> our<00:03:37.590> third<00:03:37.860> fret<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.130> the

a<00:04:22.850> b-flat<00:04:23.540> again

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
a b-flat again

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.059 
a b-flat again
this<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.509> verse

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.379 

now<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.520> last<00:04:30.529> F<00:04:31.529> in<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.889> verse<00:04:32.819> they're<00:04:33.089> kind

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
now the last F in the verse they're kind

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.909

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
of building up to the course use do a

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.890 
of building up to the course use do a
regular<00:04:35.099> f<00:04:35.339> bar<00:04:35.550> chord<00:04:35.819> or

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.140 

all<00:04:39.260> right<00:04:39.410> now<00:04:39.770> we<00:04:39.830> get<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.370> chorus<00:04:40.970> which

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
all right now we get to the chorus which

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:49.220 
all right now we get to the chorus which
sounds<00:04:41.390> like<00:04:41.480> this

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.050 

all<00:04:50.040> right<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:50.490> those<00:04:50.580> three<00:04:50.820> cores

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
all right so it's just those three cores

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.460 
all right so it's just those three cores
repeated<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.780> one's<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.050> lot<00:04:52.260> more

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
repeated this one's a lot more

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.530 
repeated this one's a lot more
straightforward<00:04:52.710> as<00:04:53.070> no<00:04:53.220> moving<00:04:54.000> lines<00:04:54.240> going

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
straightforward as no moving lines going

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.070 
straightforward as no moving lines going
it's<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.170> D<00:04:55.410> minor<00:04:55.710> chord

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
it's just a D minor chord

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.170 

then<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:58.889> B<00:04:59.099> flat<00:05:00.650> major<00:05:01.650> chord<00:05:01.830> again<00:05:02.099> now<00:05:02.819> I

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
then that B flat major chord again now I

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.270 
then that B flat major chord again now I
was<00:05:03.750> holding<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.050> with<00:05:04.289> my<00:05:04.379> pinkie<00:05:04.770> kind<00:05:05.190> of

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
doing a bar there that's probably

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.659 
doing a bar there that's probably
uncomfortable<00:05:08.400> for<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.270> lot<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:09.840> people<00:05:10.080> so
