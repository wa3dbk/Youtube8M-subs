in with each individual episode it's
hard<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> believe<00:01:41.610> we're<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.210> having

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
hard to believe we're actually having

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
hard to believe we're actually having
character<00:01:43.380> developments<00:01:43.890> from<00:01:44.220> these

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
character developments from these
characters<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.180> only<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
characters that only have like two to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
characters that only have like two to
three<00:01:46.680> minutes<00:01:47.159> screen<00:01:47.460> time<00:01:47.729> each<00:01:48.180> week<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
three minutes screen time each week and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
three minutes screen time each week and
so<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.680> stunning<00:01:50.280> revelation

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
