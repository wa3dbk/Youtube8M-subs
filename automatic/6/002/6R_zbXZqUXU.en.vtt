00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 why it happens 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.850
 why 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 what was called compassion 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.390
 what was one of the main chips 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.810

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.889

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.989
 Well, of course 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.879
 the conversation is not about to 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.999
 block 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.929
 reality as it says in rural 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.939

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.339
 labor exploits flexible victories i pro 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.769
 other 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 why we don't want such 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.749
 why are we not interested in winning 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.229
 why we 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.449
 disconnected 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.980
 here are the dollars m single 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.919

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.259
 Putin 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.749
 damn oligarchic power friend everything 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.089
 anything can be said but we are 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.979
 we understand 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.530
 quite humiliating 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.259
 how do we stop there? 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.709
 assume that we are led so much 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.879
 government and state and 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.189
 oligarchs that we do not have internal forces 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.790
 in order to confront within 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.370
 this godlessness and lack of it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.370
 composition 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.240
 I have no answer 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.680
 i.e. maybe there is this answer 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 to new so to speak 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.699
 I think that he is but he is not he 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.419
 not final 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.719
 I would like from the question just us together 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.379
 makings 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.639
 think about how 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.889
 that's why it was so clear 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.549
 and that's how it goes about leaving 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.360
 where 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 whenever possible 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.409
 real stress
