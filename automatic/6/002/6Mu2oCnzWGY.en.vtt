show you they have an on switch here a

show you they have an on switch here a
button<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> plus<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> minus

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
button and then a plus and a minus

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
button and then a plus and a minus
little<00:00:49.739> turn<00:00:50.520> button<00:00:52.039> it<00:00:53.039> goes<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
little turn button it goes up to I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
little turn button it goes up to I
believe<00:00:54.480> 400<00:00:55.260> degrees<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
believe 400 degrees this is the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.729 
believe 400 degrees this is the
difference<00:00:57.840> between<00:00:57.899> these<00:00:58.289> wands<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
difference between these wands and the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
difference between these wands and the
other<00:00:58.890> ones<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.460> did<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> those<00:01:00.510> were

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
other ones that I did is those were

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
other ones that I did is those were
tapered<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.070> smaller<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> end

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
tapered so they got smaller at the end

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
tapered so they got smaller at the end
this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.960> completely<00:01:04.140> big<00:01:05.070> barreled<00:01:05.489> one

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this is just completely big barreled one

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.460 
this is just completely big barreled one
and<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> half<00:01:06.479> inch<00:01:06.750> barrel<00:01:07.650> curling<00:01:08.310> wand<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
Remington I remember I did it I think it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370

didn't<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.340> handle<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
didn't like the handle because the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
didn't like the handle because the
plastic<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.530> bit<00:01:43.649> slippery<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
plastic was a little bit slippery but I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
plastic was a little bit slippery but I
can<00:01:45.149> tell<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.259> made<00:01:46.560> out

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can tell you right now this is made out

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
can tell you right now this is made out
of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> same<00:01:47.040> plastic<00:01:47.390> different<00:01:48.390> color<00:01:48.540> but

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of the same plastic different color but

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
of the same plastic different color but
it's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.270> better<00:01:51.390> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's a little it's a little better but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
it's a little it's a little better but
it's<00:01:51.930> definitely<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.530> slippery<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it's definitely not a slippery the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's definitely not a slippery the
barrel<00:01:54.240> isn't<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.600> slippery<00:01:54.930> either<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:57.110> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
barrel isn't a slippery either and the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.719 
barrel isn't a slippery either and the
only<00:01:58.290> thing<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.610> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
only thing that I kind of don't like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.940 
only thing that I kind of don't like
which<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> disappointed<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
which I was kind of disappointed in is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.200 
which I was kind of disappointed in is
the<00:02:02.100> fact<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.549> doesn't<00:02:02.909> have

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the fact that it doesn't have

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
the fact that it doesn't have
of<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> gauge<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.770> sort<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.220> little<00:02:06.500> screen

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
of a gauge or any sort of little screen

temperature or at least like a number um

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.960 
temperature or at least like a number um
even<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:13.950> regular<00:02:14.100> curling<00:02:14.580> iron<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.850> has

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
even just my regular curling iron it has

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.540 
even just my regular curling iron it has
like<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.209> number<00:02:15.420> from<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:16.110> thirty

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
like a number from one to like thirty

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.729 
like a number from one to like thirty
this<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.880> has<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.630> right<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.470> lights

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
this just has this right here it lights

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.100 
this just has this right here it lights
up<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> blue<00:02:20.489> light<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.060> blinks<00:02:21.480> until

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
up like a blue light that blinks until

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.070 
up like a blue light that blinks until
it's<00:02:22.290> hot<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.739> then<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.860> stays<00:02:23.130> blue<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.690> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
it's hot and then it stays blue so you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.740 
it's hot and then it stays blue so you
know<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> don't<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:27.090> other<00:02:27.510> than<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
know I don't really know other than the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.740 
know I don't really know other than the
plus<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.319> minus<00:02:28.350> sign<00:02:29.270> where<00:02:30.270> I'm<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
plus and the minus sign where I'm at as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
plus and the minus sign where I'm at as
far<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.930> temperature<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.910> say

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
far as temperature so I have to say

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.280 
far as temperature so I have to say
that's<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.270> big<00:02:33.510> downfall

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that's a big downfall

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.790 
that's a big downfall
now<00:02:35.540> aesthetically<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.140> think<00:02:37.440> as

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
now aesthetically that's what I think as

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400 
now aesthetically that's what I think as
far<00:02:38.160> as<00:02:38.580> how<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.000> functions<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.989> think<00:02:40.320> it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
far as how it functions I think it's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.270 
far as how it functions I think it's
great

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
great

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.840 
great
definitely<00:02:42.090> heats<00:02:42.269> up<00:02:42.450> quick<00:02:42.720> gets<00:02:43.410> super<00:02:43.800> hot

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
definitely heats up quick gets super hot

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.420 
definitely heats up quick gets super hot
this<00:02:45.090> stays<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:46.050> cool<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.800> touch<00:02:47.010> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
this stays pretty cool to the touch and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
this stays pretty cool to the touch and
I<00:02:48.330> don't<00:02:48.540> use<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> glove<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.500> just
