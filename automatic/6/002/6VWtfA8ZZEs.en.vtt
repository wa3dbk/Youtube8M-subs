00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.570
 what's simpler and the poorest 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.370
 one potato was also another 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.570
 dish 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:25.240
 it's like another poor dish then 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.820
 also other dishes always with vegetables 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.380
 always poor dishes with potatoes with la 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.400
 pasta seem, however, is very good excuse and 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.400
 it is blended 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.559
 exact because the potato must 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.040
 dissolve and must be at last 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.329
 mixed with pasta and then as is 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.690
 it were 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.210
 like saying a sauce at the end almost of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 potato 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.430
 it is therefore and the chef's care to ensure that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.390
 becomes a mixture here is a cheese that 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.210
 it gives even more body to the whole dish but 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.540
 I repeat, however, it was born as a dish 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.540
 poor 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.799
 the dynamo notes I find it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.540
 it's one of my favorites because of the sauce 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.570
 same as the new 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 how do the man made sauce is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 the condiment to the poorest pasta of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 so i guess there isn't and like a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.630
 unique flavor 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 also there always from a need for money 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.370
 that we were poor and therefore the hand with 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 the eggs 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.040
 here the pasta did not need 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.870
 buy the meat to make the gravy of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.750
 buy the oil that was tender that the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.370
 tender meat tender and sauce and then there 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.390
 he also wanted hours of cooking because 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.310
 wide as injured to make the famous ragÃ¹ 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.470
 cooking spiders honor 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 then it was fast for the moms they did 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.190
 a park a rich dish because with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.040
 man is very rich rich fast 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.290
 and poor then 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.420
 that was always the point of doing 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 something of little that cost little 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.950
 it disappeared perhaps because not many 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.000
 tell or not many do not have mal 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.000
 they ate 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.569
 this could be the explanation e 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.760
 so not knowing it they don't know it 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.150
 tell and don't want it 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.150
 to cook 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.540
 like so many things that Neapolitan in the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.370
 Neapolitan culture they do not want 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.370
 tell of our tradition 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.380
 the Genoese is truly a mystery 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.780
 still today there are many stories a 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.630
 respect that then Genoese has nothing to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.230
 what to see with Genoa 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:13.310
 someone says that he was the chef 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.260
 del rey sangiu and someone told me 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.380
 who did this and we know that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.890
 onion was one of the strong things of 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.010
 French made this false with the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.200
 onion and since he was called sangiu 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.870
 and they called saint just this is one 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.730
 story another story and that came 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.090
 ships with meat and meat 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.350
 it could not be maintained at that time 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.510
 they tried to stun the labor 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.790
 if we want also in fact that 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.220
 the meat was now a little gone with 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.550
 with onion and this is another 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.430
 history and therefore also in waters because 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.060
 then la carte the sauce also that one 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.959
 use the meat in addition to the onion though 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.240
 still today nobody knows exactly and 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.820
 done with 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.550
 the onion and the meat that comes 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.220
 cooked and as if they were a ragÃ¹ that 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.940
 instead of using the sauce we use the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.610
 onion takes 12 hours of cooking 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.180
 so it is a culture that claims many 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:28.449
 hours is a cure and at the end of mind or 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.670
 becomes a schiphol sauce that therefore 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.920
 light even dry 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.040
 it is cooked for 12 hours and even if the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.750
 onion might think of something 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.750
 instead very light
