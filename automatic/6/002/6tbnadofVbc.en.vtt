Wireless<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:52.159> great<00:00:52.370> for<00:00:52.550> device<00:00:52.820> like<00:00:53.059> this

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
Wireless is great for device like this

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.930 
Wireless is great for device like this
we<00:00:54.320> want<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.620> be<00:00:54.680> connected<00:00:54.949> off<00:00:55.219> always<00:00:55.670> on

we want to be connected off always on
the<00:00:56.089> go<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.930> wimax<00:00:57.859> actually<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.399> great

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
the go and wimax actually is a great

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340 
the go and wimax actually is a great
great<00:00:59.059> example<00:00:59.539> with<00:00:59.629> technology<00:01:00.109> that<00:01:00.260> we

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
great example with technology that we

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.689 
great example with technology that we
will<00:01:00.500> be<00:01:00.620> supporting<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:01.070> device<00:01:01.309> like<00:01:01.339> this

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
will be supporting a device like this

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.250 
will be supporting a device like this
with<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:01.909> high<00:01:02.089> bandwidth<00:01:02.539> needed<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.079> rich

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
with a high bandwidth needed to a rich

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.529 
with a high bandwidth needed to a rich
entertainment<00:01:03.769> experience<00:01:04.250> okay<00:01:04.789> looks<00:01:05.479> like

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
entertainment experience okay looks like

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.789 
entertainment experience okay looks like
we're<00:01:05.659> having<00:01:05.840> some<00:01:06.049> troubles<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:06.470> the

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
we're having some troubles with the

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.029 
we're having some troubles with the
streaming<00:01:07.670> here<00:01:07.789> but<00:01:07.970> let's<00:01:08.119> just<00:01:08.619> move<00:01:09.619> on<00:01:09.740> so

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
streaming here but let's just move on so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.350 
streaming here but let's just move on so
another<00:01:10.490> thing<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.729> can<00:01:10.820> do<00:01:10.939> with<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.149> is

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
another thing you can do with this is

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.660 
another thing you can do with this is
it's<00:01:11.509> just<00:01:11.570> check<00:01:11.780> out<00:01:11.930> your<00:01:12.289> photos<00:01:12.649> so<00:01:13.490> keep

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
cued up for my flight so we've got some

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.249 
cued up for my flight so we've got some
movies<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.909> previously<00:01:29.060> downloaded<00:01:29.450> to

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
movies that I previously downloaded to

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.180 
movies that I previously downloaded to
the<00:01:30.289> device<00:01:31.000> we<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:33.590> will<00:01:33.770> see<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.039> I

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
the device we can you will see here I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.300 
the device we can you will see here I
guess<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.640> high-definition<00:01:36.039> video<00:01:37.039> of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
guess this is a high-definition video of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.100 
guess this is a high-definition video of
the<00:01:37.670> movie<00:01:37.880> up<00:01:38.030> which<00:01:38.240> my<00:01:38.420> daughter<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:38.929> just

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the movie up which my daughter is just

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.639 
the movie up which my daughter is just
in<00:01:39.259> love<00:01:39.500> with<00:01:39.679> right<00:01:39.860> now<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.280> hot<00:01:41.649> capturing

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
in love with right now so hot capturing

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.380 
in love with right now so hot capturing
so<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.039> is<00:01:43.159> really<00:01:43.310> picking<00:01:43.880> up<00:01:44.090> all<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
so this is really picking up all the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.850 
so this is really picking up all the
capabilities<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.170> performance<00:01:45.619> from<00:01:45.740> a

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
capabilities and performance from a

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.309 
capabilities and performance from a
dual-core<00:01:46.520> processor<00:01:47.090> like<00:01:47.270> making<00:01:47.569> but<00:01:48.200> yeah

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
dual-core processor like making but yeah

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.809 
dual-core processor like making but yeah
then<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.619> dual<00:01:48.770> core<00:01:49.009> processor<00:01:49.039> it's

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
then the dual core processor it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.399 
then the dual core processor it's
