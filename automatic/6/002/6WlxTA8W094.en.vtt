00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.750 
Hawkins no and this is for here a new
growth<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.750> very<00:02:14.959> encouraging<00:02:15.140> sign

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
growth so this is very encouraging sign

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.539 
growth so this is very encouraging sign
now<00:02:16.760> eventually<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.239> have<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.720> trellis

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
now eventually I have to get a trellis

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:26.160 
now eventually I have to get a trellis
to<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:21.110> help<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:22.120> plant<00:02:23.120> clamp<00:02:23.510> up<00:02:23.720> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
to to to help this to plant clamp up and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.630 
to to to help this to plant clamp up and
right<00:02:27.170> now<00:02:27.290> I'm<00:02:27.410> growing<00:02:27.709> single<00:02:28.070> stem<00:02:28.280> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
right now I'm growing single stem and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.960 
right now I'm growing single stem and
once<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.630> reach<00:02:29.840> about<00:02:30.110> six<00:02:30.500> feet<00:02:30.799> then<00:02:31.640> I'll

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
once you reach about six feet then I'll

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.080 
once you reach about six feet then I'll
allow<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.750> grant<00:02:33.019> out<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.680> umbrella

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
allow it to grant out like an umbrella

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.910 
allow it to grant out like an umbrella
so<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.360> how<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.510> imagine<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.290> so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
so this is how I imagine it so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.590 
so this is how I imagine it so
eventually<00:02:37.430> they'll<00:02:37.549> take<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.850> at<00:02:38.000> least<00:02:38.150> from

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
eventually they'll take up at least from

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.720 
eventually they'll take up at least from
this<00:02:38.780> guy<00:02:38.959> here<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.709> point<00:02:40.040> Don<00:02:40.250> will<00:02:40.580> take

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
this guy here this point Don will take

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.820 
this guy here this point Don will take
up<00:02:40.850> never<00:02:41.030> through<00:02:41.269> maybe<00:02:41.420> three<00:02:41.720> feet<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.709> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
up never through maybe three feet to the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.190 
up never through maybe three feet to the
left<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.209> right<00:02:44.299> doesn't<00:02:44.840> matter

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
left or to the right doesn't matter

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.259 
left or to the right doesn't matter
and<00:02:45.440> same<00:02:45.980> thing<00:02:46.010> with<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.340> one<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.940> ion

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
and same thing with this one this ion

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.470 
and same thing with this one this ion
will<00:02:47.959> extend<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.470> 3<00:02:49.040> feet<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.790> meant<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
will extend out 3 feet I meant from the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.080 
will extend out 3 feet I meant from the
top<00:02:50.750> six<00:02:51.380> feet<00:02:51.530> through<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.709> top<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.940> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
top six feet through the top so it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.670 
top six feet through the top so it
looked<00:02:53.269> like<00:02:53.329> an<00:02:53.510> umbrella<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:56.079> if<00:02:57.079> I<00:02:57.290> require

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
looked like an umbrella and if I require

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.949 
looked like an umbrella and if I require
different<00:02:57.950> type<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.310> structure<00:02:58.930> trellis

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
different type of structure trellis

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.740 
different type of structure trellis
unlike<00:03:00.799> tomatoes<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.910> need<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> lot<00:03:02.540> more

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
unlike tomatoes so it need a lot more

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.059 
unlike tomatoes so it need a lot more
heavier<00:03:03.260> structure<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.700> hold<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:06.069> and

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
heavier structure to hold this to and

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.990 
heavier structure to hold this to and
also<00:03:07.430> eventually<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.239> will<00:03:08.390> try<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.110> grow<00:03:09.680> the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
also eventually I will try to grow the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.199 
also eventually I will try to grow the
red<00:03:11.000> flesh<00:03:11.810> variety<00:03:12.380> too<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.940> now<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.090> don't

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
red flesh variety too right now I don't

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.809 
red flesh variety too right now I don't
have<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.599> plant<00:03:15.050> I<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.319> have<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.500> cutting<00:03:15.830> my

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
have a plant I don't have to cutting my

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.970 
have a plant I don't have to cutting my
relative<00:03:17.300> do<00:03:17.510> have<00:03:17.720> one<00:03:17.959> one<00:03:18.380> plant<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.860> is

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
relative do have one one plant that is

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.670 
relative do have one one plant that is
young<00:03:19.220> plant<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.760> can't<00:03:19.970> use<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.209> cutting<00:03:20.680> you

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
young plant so I can't use a cutting you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.250 
young plant so I can't use a cutting you
have<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.950> use<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.690> cutting<00:03:23.690> from<00:03:23.870> an<00:03:24.050> old

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
have to use a cutting from an old

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.440 
have to use a cutting from an old
picture<00:03:24.980> plant<00:03:25.430> maybe<00:03:25.670> two<00:03:25.970> or<00:03:26.120> three<00:03:26.239> years

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
picture plant maybe two or three years

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.410 
picture plant maybe two or three years
old<00:03:27.819> okay<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:28.879> that's<00:03:29.300> my<00:03:29.629> update<00:03:30.940> on<00:03:31.940> my

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
old okay so that's my update on my

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.960 
old okay so that's my update on my
dragon<00:03:32.840> fruit<00:03:33.140> as<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.800> can<00:03:33.920> see<00:03:34.099> here<00:03:34.400> not<00:03:34.940> a

moats organic notes and compost that

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.729 
moats organic notes and compost that
will<00:03:45.410> keep<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.739> soil<00:03:45.920> somewhat<00:03:46.400> moist<00:03:47.200> but<00:03:48.200> to

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
will keep the soil somewhat moist but to

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.589 
will keep the soil somewhat moist but to
make<00:03:48.920> sure<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.310> must<00:03:49.550> have<00:03:49.819> good<00:03:50.360> drainage

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
make sure you must have good drainage

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.860 
make sure you must have good drainage
otherwise<00:03:51.290> plant<00:03:52.099> will<00:03:52.250> die

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
otherwise plant will die

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.990 
otherwise plant will die
attractive<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> seems<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.250> moisture<00:03:55.730> it

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
attractive it seems like moisture it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.750 
attractive it seems like moisture it
seems<00:03:56.210> like<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.510> heat<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.870> moisture<00:03:57.760> but

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
seems like the heat the moisture but

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.100 
seems like the heat the moisture but
like<00:03:59.000> saying<00:03:59.240> you<00:03:59.330> did<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.750> have<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.990> have

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
like saying you did you have to have

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.000 
like saying you did you have to have
drainage<00:04:02.260> they<00:04:03.260> were<00:04:03.320> thank<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.710> I'm

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
drainage they were thank you I'm

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.820 
drainage they were thank you I'm
watching<00:04:04.220> increased<00:04:05.180> tune<00:04:05.420> in<00:04:05.600> and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
watching increased tune in and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.940 
watching increased tune in and
eventually<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:06.920> won't<00:04:07.130> update<00:04:08.710> everyone<00:04:09.710> in

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
eventually I won't update everyone in

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.730 
eventually I won't update everyone in
the<00:04:10.100> next<00:04:10.370> video<00:04:10.670> when<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:12.730> thank
