00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.040
 slop games 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.750

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.119

 foreigners have worked hard no 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.440
 there are no sounds in this game at all 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.420
 but apparently worth downloading to cook music 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.180
 muzonchik and put just mom that 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.269

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.379

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.950
 conscience now now with regard to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.110
 I would like to know my opponent why 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.700

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.330
 I do not really understand in the drill plow 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.650
 almost impossible to watch it 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.070

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.410
 Click here now I am present 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:49.570

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:52.360
 intellectual and okay all my pony 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.430
 the rival for some reason stands still and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.260
 we can only look 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.270
 what kind of game is it really 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.610
 really like this game on again 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.760
 proves that he knows how to do the race is not 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.770
 it doesn't matter what situation you are in 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.660
 are you mean with you making a game for 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.910
 Americans who will sell 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.570
 supermarket for the first supermarket for 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.820
 five dollars 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.880
 it doesn't matter if you do and looking at 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.130
 what else can i add in school school i 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.720
 I remember when we studied the eye and would answer 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 constantly tormented everyones go 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.930
 visits on how you spent your summer 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.790
 there is a ballet I have not started conducting 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.030
 want to roughly imagine how i will 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.209
 I will engage to drive the truck on 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.130
 rocks and humiliate gray 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.080
 here is the second composition of whom you want to become 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.350
 someone wrote I want to be a policeman 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.350
 go to the supermarket and shoot everyone 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.970
 promised and I always wrote I want to become 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 either producer kristina orbakaite and so 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.019
 and the second option is a trucker 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.550
 Now I certainly understand that the work 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.920
 truck driver there I don't know the driver 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.170
 trains in 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.630
 not three as a machinist and so on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.480
 often choose the third grade boys 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.860
 she 's not so much fun, and this 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.050
 the game is like another proof 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.230
 this just imagine you became 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.550
 the truck driver starts the trains 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.819
 what are you driving on post devil whip your 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.130
 rival is long dead and you drive by 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.709
 the rocks like sylvester stallone activity 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.750
 I put on street racing out of caress 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.989
 stuffy and vibrant racing club 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.910
 some place and it turned out 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.459
 turned on gta4 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.540
 I'm sure they tried first 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.850
 make another 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.810
 boy street racing there I do not know 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.049

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.870

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.420
 a lot of things can be done not only not this 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.730
 up to how she would she it was better because 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.820
 that there is at least a marvel yacht machine but 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:10.650
 about the same as it was on that 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:12.570
 regarding grafon yes yes but much more 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.660
 more interesting when anything happens 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:20.250
