as<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:39.150> bonus<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.230> look<00:02:40.350> at<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> light

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
as a bonus we will look at the light

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
as a bonus we will look at the light
green<00:02:41.100> default<00:02:41.550> preset<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.270> develop

green default preset and develop

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.190 
green default preset and develop
behavior<00:02:43.440> for<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.459> we<00:02:44.970> first<00:02:45.209> cleanup<00:02:45.720> newly

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
behavior for this we first cleanup newly

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.080 
behavior for this we first cleanup newly
created<00:02:46.470> virtual<00:02:47.160> copies

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.089 

now<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.150> create<00:02:52.629> new<00:02:52.840> virtual<00:02:53.110> copy<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.950> these

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
now we create new virtual copy of these

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.220 
now we create new virtual copy of these
five<00:02:54.430> photos<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.810> keep<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
five photos so that we keep the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.270 
five photos so that we keep the
originals<00:02:56.709> unchanged

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.190 

next<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:04.610> apply<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.000> same<00:03:05.330> preset<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.020> these

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
next we apply the same preset to these

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.290 
next we apply the same preset to these
