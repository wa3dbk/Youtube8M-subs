and there's a full list of functions

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.010 
and there's a full list of functions
obviously<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.489> favorite<00:01:50.119> would<00:01:50.989> be

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
well it's quite hard to control it's

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.860 
well it's quite hard to control it's
like<00:02:11.090> literally<00:02:11.480> impossible<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.230> control

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
like literally impossible to control

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.640 
like literally impossible to control
really<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.879> drill<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.180> may<00:02:17.569> just<00:02:17.959> wind<00:02:18.260> up<00:02:18.410> in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
really the drill you may just wind up in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.729 
really the drill you may just wind up in
some<00:02:18.859> random<00:02:19.100> area<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.590> can

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
some random area and yeah then you can

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.270 
some random area and yeah then you can
really<00:02:25.250> glitch<00:02:25.730> through<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.780> ground<00:02:27.280> but

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
really glitch through the ground but

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.740 
really glitch through the ground but
other<00:02:28.609> than<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.880> it's<00:02:29.150> quite<00:02:29.329> fun

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
other than that it's quite fun

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.460 
other than that it's quite fun
now<00:02:30.139> there's<00:02:30.380> unlimited<00:02:30.650> money<00:02:31.359> cheat<00:02:32.470> loops

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
now there's unlimited money cheat loops

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.090 
now there's unlimited money cheat loops
hence<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.639> reason<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:36.100> billion

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
hence the reason I have a billion

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.599 
hence the reason I have a billion
dollars<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:38.329> just<00:02:38.540> hit<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.049> button<00:02:39.139> and<00:02:39.650> you're

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
dollars you just hit a button and you're

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.180 
dollars you just hit a button and you're
rich<00:02:42.700> pretty<00:02:43.700> much<00:02:43.849> nothing<00:02:44.030> else<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:45.190> let

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
rich pretty much nothing else to it let

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.259
