weapon<00:00:25.320> I'm<00:00:25.410> talking<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> scar-h

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
weapon I'm talking about is the scar-h

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.550 
weapon I'm talking about is the scar-h
and<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> black<00:00:27.810> ops<00:00:28.019> 2<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> was

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and at the start of black ops 2 this was

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
and at the start of black ops 2 this was
easily<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:29.070> least<00:00:29.400> favorite<00:00:29.820> assault<00:00:30.119> rifle<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
easily my least favorite assault rifle I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.849 
easily my least favorite assault rifle I
didn't<00:00:31.019> even<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> when<00:00:31.740> i<00:00:31.800> was

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
didn't even really like it when i was

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
didn't even really like it when i was
going<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> diamond<00:00:32.610> camos<00:00:33.030> however

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
going for the diamond camos however

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.180 
going for the diamond camos however
after<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> first<00:00:34.320> patch<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> weapon<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
after the first patch the weapon got a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
after the first patch the weapon got a
crazy<00:00:35.640> buff<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.210> made<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> easily<00:00:36.750> three

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
crazy buff and made it easily three

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
crazy buff and made it easily three
times<00:00:37.440> more<00:00:37.649> effective<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.489> even<00:00:38.730> after<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
times more effective but even after that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
times more effective but even after that
I<00:00:39.420> still<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> being<00:00:40.320> used<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I still don't see it being used all that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.860 
I still don't see it being used all that
much<00:00:41.340> now<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> reason<00:00:42.120> why<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> hated<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
much now the reason why I hated it in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.389 
much now the reason why I hated it in
the<00:00:42.989> past<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the past is because this was just a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
the past is because this was just a
fairly<00:00:44.820> average<00:00:44.969> weapon<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.660> everything<00:00:46.260> it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
fairly average weapon at everything it's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
fairly average weapon at everything it's
damage<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.340> average<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.879> most<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.510> fire

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
damage was average at most it's fire

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600 
damage was average at most it's fire
rate<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.200> average<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.829> reload<00:00:50.370> times

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
rate was average it's reload times

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
rate was average it's reload times
average<00:00:50.879> even<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.690> magazine<00:00:51.989> size<00:00:52.500> was

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
average even this magazine size was

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
average even this magazine size was
average<00:00:53.070> nothing<00:00:53.730> didn't<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.149> stand<00:00:54.480> out

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
average nothing didn't really stand out

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
average nothing didn't really stand out
from<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.930> rest<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.379> made<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> go-to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
from the rest that made it like a go-to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
from the rest that made it like a go-to
weapon<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.940> any<00:00:57.090> situation<00:00:57.719> however<00:00:58.289> after

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
can get a three shot kill which is
absolutely<00:01:11.340> insane<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.180> damage<00:01:12.600> makes<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
absolutely insane that damage makes it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
absolutely insane that damage makes it
currently<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> strongest<00:01:13.799> automatic<00:01:14.310> weapon

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
currently the strongest automatic weapon

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
currently the strongest automatic weapon
in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> game<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.540> still<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
in the game but still I don't see it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
in the game but still I don't see it
being<00:01:17.100> used<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.270> killed<00:01:18.450> from

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
being used I really get killed from

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
being used I really get killed from
assault<00:01:18.960> rifles<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.560> place<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
assault rifles in the first place it's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.190 
assault rifles in the first place it's
like<00:01:20.340> always<00:01:20.549> sm<00:01:20.909> Jesus<00:01:21.210> snipers<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.020> being

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
like always sm Jesus snipers but being

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
like always sm Jesus snipers but being
killed<00:01:22.409> by<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> scar<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> even<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.030> rare

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
killed by a scar is even way more rare

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760 
killed by a scar is even way more rare
so<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> thought<00:01:25.140> I'd<00:01:25.259> show<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> couple

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so I thought I'd show you a couple

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
so I thought I'd show you a couple
classes<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.430> personally<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.270> well

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
classes that I personally like as well

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
classes that I personally like as well
as<00:01:27.780> give<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> couple<00:01:28.259> tips<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.619> hopefully

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
as give you a couple tips so hopefully

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
as give you a couple tips so hopefully
more<00:01:29.100> people<00:01:29.159> start<00:01:29.610> using<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> can

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
more people start using it and we can

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
more people start using it and we can
see<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.900> more<00:01:31.049> variety<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.560> weapons

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
see a little more variety of weapons

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.800 
see a little more variety of weapons
being<00:01:32.220> used<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.670> game<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.750> thing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
being used in game so the first thing

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.359 
being used in game so the first thing
that<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.079> should<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> its<00:01:34.979> damage

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that you should know is that its damage

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
that you should know is that its damage
is<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.579> sets<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> apart<00:01:36.090> from<00:01:36.329> everything

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is what sets it apart from everything

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
is what sets it apart from everything
else<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.920> into<00:01:38.040> gunfights

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
else so you want to get into gunfights

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.039 
else so you want to get into gunfights
that<00:01:38.820> its<00:01:38.970> damage<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.450> benefit<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that its damage will benefit you the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.840 
that its damage will benefit you the
most<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.009> close<00:01:41.189> range<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.520> pretty<00:01:41.579> much

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
most now in close range is pretty much

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
most now in close range is pretty much
every<00:01:42.180> weapon<00:01:42.329> kills<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.960> three<00:01:42.990> shots<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
every weapon kills and three shots so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.870 
every weapon kills and three shots so
that's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.070> where<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.729> into

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that's not where you want to get into

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.179 
that's not where you want to get into
most<00:01:45.119> gunfights<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.049> only<00:01:46.229> shoots<00:01:46.409> around<00:01:46.590> 600

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
most gunfights it only shoots around 600

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
most gunfights it only shoots around 600
rounds<00:01:47.310> per<00:01:47.460> minute<00:01:47.670> which<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.329> fast

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
rounds per minute which is not very fast

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
rounds per minute which is not very fast
at<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.350> although<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.250> obviously<00:01:50.340> win

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
at all so although you can obviously win

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
at all so although you can obviously win
gunfights<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.479> close<00:01:51.659> ranges<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.470> not

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
gunfights at close ranges that's not

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.289 
gunfights at close ranges that's not
where<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> weapon<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.430> most<00:01:53.759> effective

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
where the weapon will be most effective

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
where the weapon will be most effective
that<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:54.990> use<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> scar<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.649> medium<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that you want to use a scar at medium to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
that you want to use a scar at medium to
long<00:01:56.340> ranges<00:01:56.729> where<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> takes<00:01:57.180> other<00:01:57.420> guns

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
long ranges where it takes other guns

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.910 
long ranges where it takes other guns
like<00:01:57.899> four<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> five<00:01:58.290> bullets<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> kill

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
like four to five bullets to kill

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
like four to five bullets to kill
however<00:01:59.700> because<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> scars<00:02:00.450> damage<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
however because of the scars damage it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.929 
however because of the scars damage it
will<00:02:01.110> still<00:02:01.290> only<00:02:01.469> take<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.700> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
will still only take you three so this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
will still only take you three so this
is<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.210> i<00:02:03.240> mean<00:02:03.390> by<00:02:03.570> using<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> weapon<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
is what i mean by using the weapon in a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
is what i mean by using the weapon in a
way<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.740> takes<00:02:04.950> advantage<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> weapons

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
way that takes advantage of the weapons

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
way that takes advantage of the weapons
strengths<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.320> i<00:02:07.350> thought<00:02:07.560> i'd<00:02:07.649> share

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
strengths so now i thought i'd share

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.559 
strengths so now i thought i'd share
with<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.099> my<00:02:08.129> two<00:02:08.399> favorite<00:02:09.030> class<00:02:09.209> setups

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
with you my two favorite class setups

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.660 
with you my two favorite class setups
that<00:02:09.629> i<00:02:09.750> personally<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> use<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.129> they

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that i personally like to use and they

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190 
that i personally like to use and they
both<00:02:11.849> fit<00:02:12.090> different<00:02:12.360> play<00:02:12.510> styles<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.020> no

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
both fit different play styles so no

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.640 
both fit different play styles so no
matter<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.379> kind

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
matter what kind

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
player you are you can still use it so

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.270 
player you are you can still use it so
four<00:02:15.930> players<00:02:16.140> I'd<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> sit<00:02:16.829> back<00:02:16.980> more

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
four players I'd like to sit back more

people<00:02:19.470> off<00:02:19.560> from<00:02:19.769> long<00:02:20.010> ranges<00:02:20.430> i<00:02:20.610> really

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
people off from long ranges i really

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.759 
people off from long ranges i really
like<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.450> reflex<00:02:21.870> sight<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.379> foregrip

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
like the reflex sight and the foregrip

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.649 
like the reflex sight and the foregrip
attachments<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> reflex<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.540> can

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
attachments for the reflex you can

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.819 
attachments for the reflex you can
switch<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.079> with<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.470> any<00:02:25.650> other

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
switch it out with really any other

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.890 
switch it out with really any other
optic<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.489> personally<00:02:26.939> i<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.629> really<00:02:27.810> like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
optic but personally i just really like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
optic but personally i just really like
the<00:02:28.079> red<00:02:28.230> dot<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.129> foregrip<00:02:29.489> i

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the red dot but the foregrip i

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.610 
the red dot but the foregrip i
definitely<00:02:30.030> recommend<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:31.109> scar<00:02:31.349> kind<00:02:31.560> of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
definitely recommend the scar kind of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.500 
definitely recommend the scar kind of
has<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> weird<00:02:32.040> recoil<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.359> be<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
has a weird recoil to it that can be a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
has a weird recoil to it that can be a
little<00:02:33.810> hard<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.230> control<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.010> foregrip

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
little hard to control and the foregrip

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
little hard to control and the foregrip
obviously<00:02:35.849> reduces<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.599> just<00:02:37.049> makes<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
obviously reduces that and just makes it

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.630 
obviously reduces that and just makes it
a<00:02:37.439> lot<00:02:37.530> easier<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.040> kills<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.430> those

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
a lot easier to get kills from those

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580 
a lot easier to get kills from those
long<00:02:38.819> ranges<00:02:39.269> now<00:02:39.689> if<00:02:39.810> i'm<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.079> smaller<00:02:40.379> map

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
long ranges now if i'm on a smaller map

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.589 
long ranges now if i'm on a smaller map
or<00:02:40.799> maybe<00:02:41.010> play<00:02:41.280> more<00:02:41.519> aggressive<00:02:41.909> i<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.329> to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
or maybe play more aggressive i like to

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.149 
or maybe play more aggressive i like to
use<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.780> quick<00:02:42.900> draw<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.260> stock<00:02:43.530> attachments

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
use the quick draw in stock attachments
