00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
history a bit when you use the Internet

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000 
history a bit when you use the Internet
then<00:00:06.480> your<00:00:06.600> computer<00:00:06.899> saves<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.710> bits<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
then your computer saves little bits and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
then your computer saves little bits and
pieces<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.429> stuff<00:00:08.880> from<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.809> over<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.139> place

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
and eventually that can add up and it

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.250 
and eventually that can add up and it
will<00:00:13.110> bog<00:00:13.559> down<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:13.860> browser<00:00:14.870> so<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.049> good

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
will bog down your browser so it's good

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
know it's virtually impossible for the
