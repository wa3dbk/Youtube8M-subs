00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.770
 how about how boys are at it again 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.690
 I'm around here with you I'm going to 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.690
 talk a little about the nozzles 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.280
 I know that many have asked 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.350
 I'm going to use what brand what good number what 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.970
 that it is already we know that the clarinetes 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.740
 when we buy them is for the people 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.350
 who recently bought clarinet come with 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.500
 some nozzles these nozzles are very 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.330
 bad are very lousy they serve to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 learn that yes yes they are so far 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.200
 learning so far to buy us your 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.030
 clarinet recently continue with this 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.530
 learn with this mouthpiece but 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.420
 if they want to continue playing to play more 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.040
 go ahead look for another mouthpiece other 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.860
 mouthpiece much better there are different 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.629
 Nozzle marks and they are very good 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.080
 the truth for example the van dooren there 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.879
 pga nozzles and rich nozzles the month 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.589
 Yamaha are good good brands 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.960
 Cádvo nozzles that already has its 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.120
 reference your camera aperture 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.500
 well in the end a lot of things but if 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.940
 you are just learning not 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.740
 matter, I think the change between 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.390
 between the mouthpiece with the one that comes 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.950
 our clarinet we just bought it and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.299
 one of these brands that I tell you is going to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.220
 be very important what is important with 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.020
 nozzles is to try them I advise you not 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.670
 buy a closed eye nozzle 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.830
 simply because this brand does not 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.880
 simply because they recommended it or 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 simply because it is new 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.259
 In XI Marcano I advise you to try it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 first look for the sound that you 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 want in the mouthpiece the facility 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 especially because a good keel what 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.570
 that allows is that a production of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.850
 very easy sound look for the color of the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.009
 sound search in the staccato search 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.600
 that also sounds linked that also 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.130
 the treble sound so easy 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 we can give and that's the most important thing 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.909
 of the nozzles try it I've had 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.189
 your case keels since they are always 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.679
 expensive and I found one that worked for me 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.420
 several years ago that is the oldness axis 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.119
 number two is it works for me very 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.069
 ok but well I'm thinking about it too 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.659
 investigate a little more and try a little 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.729
 over nozzles to see if I achieve 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.729
 get me a much better I've had 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.720
 amagá nozzles as the flame to 46 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.900
 which is what many come with 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 clarinetes state that already gives is very bad 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.580
 try to change it from touched with 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.740
 romaric or wooden old age nozzles 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 it's like resin I've tried too 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.760
 vaccine nozzles that is another brand the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.880
 vaccine is a very good brand the truth 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.430
 When I tried this tip goes with it me 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.680
 he really liked many sounds but these 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.560
 they are quite expensive nozzles more or 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.960
 least they are out there for the 800 thousand 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 Colombian pesos that are more or less 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.160
 like 400 dollars or so then 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.320
 they are quite expensive but they are 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 quality and they are very good that yes testing 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.660
 the first I have once as I already 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.720
 I told them and this cost me more or less 300 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.490
 thousand pesos that would be like 150 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.580
 dollars more or less then you see that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.020
 they are pretty expensive, but what 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.510
 that are of quality is that we are going to 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.130
 find a sound so much better than 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 with the ordinary nozzles with which 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.430
 come the bugles and then I'll make a 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.680
 much more detailed video about 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.690
 nozzles on it more technical things 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.730
 of the mouthpiece as the opening as that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.860
 cane to use and all that but for example I 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.260
 I play with three and a half reeds and the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.570
 nozzle pg the number two depends a lot 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.170
 also of the cane the functioning of 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.970
 one 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.819
 maybe with the cane that you touch 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.470
 in mine it does not serve them that with the meat 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.680
 that I touch your little mouth to me 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.989
 it does not work for me then it's basically 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.180
 try to prove a lot for those who 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.280
 they are here in Bogota Colombia there is a 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.830
 store where they let you try several 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
 nozzles and there also people who sell 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.970
 nozzles is a matter of finding out yourself or 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.610
 ask me and I will give them the link or 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.170
 the address of the store where where 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.060
 you can find them for example for 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.010
 buy mine yo problems or -5 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.840
 nozzles of the same brand of the same 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.269
 reference until I found the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.980
 mouthpiece that I liked the most about those five 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.420
 but notice that there were five of the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.850
 Same brand of the same reference 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.799
 then outside they see a lot, try a lot 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.350
 nozzles experience a lot with the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.970
 sound with the embouchure the ease of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.210
 produce sound and this will help them 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.550
 very much to improve yes 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.080
 if they can get a better mouthpiece 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.820
 good especially for this video two 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.380
