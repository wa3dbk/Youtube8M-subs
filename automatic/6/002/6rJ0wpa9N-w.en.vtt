shooting it for a couple days in a row
during<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.570> frame<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
during that time frame and that it

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.590 
during that time frame and that it
always<00:00:51.239> appears<00:00:52.050> during<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.190> frame

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
always appears during that time frame

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.240 
always appears during that time frame
and<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:55.050> course<00:00:55.289> they've<00:00:55.500> slowed<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and of course they've slowed down the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.069 
and of course they've slowed down the
footage<00:00:56.610> they've<00:00:56.940> enhanced<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.690> footage

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
footage they've enhanced the footage

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.549 
footage they've enhanced the footage
they<00:00:59.000> enlarge<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.329> footage<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> even

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
they enlarge the footage and even

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.160 
they enlarge the footage and even
experts<00:01:02.300> are<00:01:03.300> trying<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> figure<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:03.989> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
experts are trying to figure out what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
experts are trying to figure out what
that<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.500> isn't<00:01:04.799> day<00:01:05.689> scratching<00:01:06.689> their<00:01:06.810> head

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that it isn't day scratching their head

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.219 
that it isn't day scratching their head
because<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> calling

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
because they don't know so the calling

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.039 
because they don't know so the calling
it<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> UFO<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it a UFO but do you think that it's a

UFO that's a a lien craft flying around

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.499 
UFO that's a a lien craft flying around
Denver<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:19.350> could<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:20.009> mean<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.270> state<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Denver it could be i mean the state of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.560 
Denver it could be i mean the state of
colorado<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.920> legalized<00:01:23.640> pot<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.390> maybe

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
colorado has just legalized pot so maybe

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
fact an alien spacecraft is you know

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.730 
fact an alien spacecraft is you know
denver<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.450> pot<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.619> they're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
denver is where the pot is and they're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
denver is where the pot is and they're
just<00:01:31.890> coming<00:01:32.040> down<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> dime<00:01:32.790> bag<00:01:33.030> or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
just coming down to get a dime bag or

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
just coming down to get a dime bag or
two<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.049> flying<00:01:34.470> off<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
two and then they go flying off to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460 
two and then they go flying off to
wherever<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.759> came<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.450> they'd<00:01:37.110> smoke

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
wherever they came from and they'd smoke

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.760 
wherever they came from and they'd smoke
and<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.860> hot<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.520> cannot<00:01:39.119> fly<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
and get hot because you cannot fly a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
and get hot because you cannot fly a
spaceship<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.430> high<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> same<00:01:42.060> time

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
spaceship and be high at the same time

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710 
spaceship and be high at the same time
so<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.570> don't<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:44.450> who<00:01:45.450> knows<00:01:45.479> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so they don't do that or who knows what

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200 
so they don't do that or who knows what
the<00:01:45.990> heck<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.110> could<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.710> maybe<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the heck this could be maybe it's the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.469
