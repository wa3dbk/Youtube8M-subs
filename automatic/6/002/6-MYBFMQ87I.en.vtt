00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.070 
chest and back your neck and the theory
is<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.130> when<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.690> change<00:02:50.690> your<00:02:50.840> body

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
is is that when you change your body

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.290 
is is that when you change your body
temperature<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.680> those<00:02:51.800> areas<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.880> your

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
temperature in those areas that your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.170 
temperature in those areas that your
body<00:02:53.720> has<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.800> kick<00:02:55.130> up<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:55.310> furnace<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.060> in

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
body has to kick up your furnace and in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.630 
body has to kick up your furnace and in
turn<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.840> actually<00:02:57.410> burns<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.220> fat<00:02:58.340> cells

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
turn it actually burns the fat cells

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.000 
turn it actually burns the fat cells
there<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.780> can<00:03:00.260> obviously<00:03:00.380> tell<00:03:00.830> you

I've been doing that and then the other

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.570 
I've been doing that and then the other
thing<00:03:19.940> I've<00:03:20.840> been<00:03:21.010> incorporating<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.400> my

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
thing I've been incorporating on my

thing I've been incorporating on my
cheat<00:03:22.880> days<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.530> I'm<00:03:24.530> doing<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.920> full<00:03:25.160> P<00:03:25.370> AGG

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
cheat days is I'm doing the full P AGG

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.150 
cheat days is I'm doing the full P AGG
program<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:27.380> you're<00:03:27.470> not<00:03:27.590> familiar<00:03:27.799> with<00:03:28.040> that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
program if you're not familiar with that

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.100 
program if you're not familiar with that
I<00:03:28.280> definitely<00:03:28.700> recommend<00:03:28.910> looking<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.480> up<00:03:29.600> pH

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
I definitely recommend looking it up pH

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.830 
I definitely recommend looking it up pH
eg<00:03:30.650> for<00:03:31.400> our<00:03:31.580> body<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.299> should<00:03:32.480> be<00:03:32.600> able<00:03:32.690> to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
eg for our body you should be able to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.880 
eg for our body you should be able to
get<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:34.040> pollito<00:03:35.030> señal<00:03:35.890> alpha

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
get it but it's it's pollito señal alpha

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.930 
get it but it's it's pollito señal alpha

extract and you take it three times a
day<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.670> supposed<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.000> help<00:03:44.150> with<00:03:44.269> insulin

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
day it's supposed to help with insulin

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.979
