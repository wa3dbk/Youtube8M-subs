configuration and one in a straight horse.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.030
You lift the ramp and the fourth horse fits
right here. You don't have a fourth horse

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.180
and you use the golf cart or an ATV

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.290

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.609

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.930

As you can see you can put hay, extension
cords, many many other things under this

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:18.760

unit, the water tank

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.250

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.400
when you're done competing at your horse
show or the rope in, you can come on over

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.020
