but<00:02:16.280> anyways<00:02:16.640> our<00:02:17.120> next<00:02:17.510> tip<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:18.010> restrictions

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
but anyways our next tip is restrictions

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.910 
but anyways our next tip is restrictions
so<00:02:19.390> avoid<00:02:20.390> entering<00:02:20.600> shaking<00:02:21.350> patches<00:02:21.800> of

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so avoid entering shaking patches of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.490 
so avoid entering shaking patches of
brass<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.640> edges<00:02:23.090> corners<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> beside

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
brass on the edges corners and beside

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.430 
brass on the edges corners and beside
you<00:02:24.800> they<00:02:25.250> will<00:02:25.550> break<00:02:25.880> your<00:02:26.120> chain<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.050> these

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
you they will break your chain so these

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.530 
you they will break your chain so these
are<00:02:27.709> very<00:02:28.100> important<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:28.790> entering

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
are very important because entering

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.390 
are very important because entering
these<00:02:29.660> patches<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.230> grass<00:02:30.410> even<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.160> look

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
these patches of grass even if they look

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.210 
these patches of grass even if they look
good<00:02:31.670> will<00:02:32.270> break<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:32.900> chain<00:02:33.290> sometimes

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
good will break your chain sometimes

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.550 
good will break your chain sometimes
they<00:02:34.459> won't<00:02:34.670> sometimes<00:02:35.600> they<00:02:35.810> will<00:02:36.080> but

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
they won't sometimes they will but

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.130 
they won't sometimes they will but
taking<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.070> risk<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.580> never<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.150> good<00:02:38.420> idea<00:02:38.480> so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
taking the risk is never a good idea so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.440 
taking the risk is never a good idea so
just<00:02:39.350> avoid<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.950> edges<00:02:40.340> avoid<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.030> corners

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
just avoid the edges avoid the corners

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.949 
just avoid the edges avoid the corners
and<00:02:41.660> avoid<00:02:41.989> any<00:02:42.290> patches<00:02:42.770> beside<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.959> leaving

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
and avoid any patches beside you leaving

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.960 
and avoid any patches beside you leaving

your chain so I'm actually using thief
and<00:03:27.950> Thunderbolt<00:03:28.670> which<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.060> combination

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
and Thunderbolt which is a combination

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.670 
and Thunderbolt which is a combination
of<00:03:29.810> 25<00:03:30.290> PP<00:03:30.830> +<00:03:31.040> 15<00:03:31.970> PP

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
and that equals 40 PP and I know those

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.649 
and that equals 40 PP and I know those
moves<00:03:35.739> will<00:03:36.010> not<00:03:36.280> miss<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.000> each<00:03:37.239> time<00:03:37.629> I

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
moves will not miss so that each time I
