 make this beet salad recipe 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.600
 it's very easy, let's start putting 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.040
 our details in aluminum foil and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 we are going to put the launcher as if 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.610
 outside a potato 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.579
 they are going to associate hands is inevitable 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.559
 but they do not rot it is removed with pure water 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.119
 and once you have removed the skin what 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.880
 I'm going to wrap it in a piece of paper 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.480
 aluminum and now if we are ready to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.670
 move to the stream 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.070
 I will put the details directly in the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.160
 coal level and I'll wait there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.000
 about 40 minutes to be very smooth if 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.000
 well roasted 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.890
 the beet is ready, it's already soft and 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.479
 now we can cut it 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.479
 to serve our salad 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.320
 I'm going to place the beet cubes over 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.190
 a bed of arugula 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.900
 let's put some lemon juice 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.900
 olive oil and a touch of salt 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.009
 the arugula is a very expensive herb but 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.009
 they can also use lettuce 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.110
 Well, the vegetables are ready 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.290
 let me take them to the dog and there we 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.290

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.409
 that is, how we solved one more of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.959
