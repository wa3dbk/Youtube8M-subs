00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.299
 one that is between youtube today I'm going to 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.150
 teach how to print your own letter 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.580
 of rain beginning with this image that 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:15.460
 we just created the previous video 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:20.610
 about work to the bar we started 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.610
 we already open the word 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.200
 and we drag free 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 if you have old letters 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.290
 useless that are repeated either 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.059
 new a little bit not so old anymore but 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.970
 that is still resistant and that they are 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.730
 firm what we are going to do is print 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.120
 the image and paste it into one that letter and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 a repeated any good to know 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.790
 what is the average of the letter and the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.000
 image first we look for a rule 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.820
 and we measure it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.800
 these are the dimensions of the letter 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 that I have are very small for 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.190
 deciding these letters are the most 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.590
 small that I've had since I 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.260
 They are usually larger one are 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.380
 medium good first with the rule 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.960
 we measure from 0 to the tip 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.630
 and from my foot and the size of my letter 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:27.369
 width is from 0 to 5 5 and 4 lines 5.4 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.960
 6 centimeters wide and high from 0 to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:36.590
 7 7 and 9 dashes 7.9 stripe 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.030
 then we give you right click and in 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.860
 size 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 and we put pancho 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 5 as against 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 and here and here it gets simple 7.8 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:00.380
 sometimes they will be changed sometimes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.909
 approximately 7.83 84 85 and here also 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.729
 5.43 42 good 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.890
 we already have the letter done when 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.610
 go to print will come out a little bit 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 smaller than normal but only 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.840
 by x mm 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.030
 to be able to print more letters in the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:31.230
 same word sheet we're going to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.250
 design and images we give you narrow 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 orientation 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:45.270
 let's read horizontal and in letter size 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.270
 what I do what I do is copy 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.610
 two spaces three spaces and paste 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.220
 and the same 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.210
 and here they fit eight letters 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.210
 if you want it 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.960
 how will they see 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.500
 here they are to print them 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.820
 and when you have them and print them 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.130
 they will leave wynn of good quality not 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.920
 so high if you have laser printer 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 or digital printing should be much 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.030
 better already after they print it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.940
 trim the edges 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.750
 said rubber a little bit of rubber if it has 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.530
 rubber in bar also not so much and what 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.780
 does is paste the i's to trim the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.280
 edges and whether it has exceeded the card 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:49.989
 original after you put it there 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.600
 under a book and crushes it and if 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.330
 you want you can put on top so that 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.270
 to get the bubbles out and now 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.940
 then yes some edges I finish it 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.650
 cut and ready and have their 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.010
 own letters 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.730
 of yoyo 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.010
 and another thing and how to print mine 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.220
 to see these molecules here 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:19.220
 increased dragon to war is live the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.220
 icor equaled and that's all
