I assume the fish would all be there to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.749 
I assume the fish would all be there to
leggo<00:01:58.899> and<00:01:59.560> as<00:01:59.770> they<00:01:59.920> look<00:02:00.130> really<00:02:00.369> closely<00:02:00.580> I

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
leggo and as they look really closely I

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.730 
leggo and as they look really closely I
saw<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.390> they<00:02:01.509> were<00:02:01.539> real
