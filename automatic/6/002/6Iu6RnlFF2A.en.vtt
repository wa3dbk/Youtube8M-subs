00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
back here with a door that opens up so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
back here with a door that opens up so
you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.680> stairs<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.369> come<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you can go to the stairs I come into the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.639 
you can go to the stairs I come into the
store<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:41.070> need<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> build<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.360> door

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
store and I still need to build the door

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
store and I still need to build the door
the<00:01:43.649> doors<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the doors to put on here and then you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.870 
the doors to put on here and then you
have<00:01:45.990> doors<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> truck<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> pull<00:01:47.640> into

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
have doors for the truck to pull into

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.560 
have doors for the truck to pull into
obviously<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> corner<00:01:50.180> building<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
obviously this is a corner building so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.609 
obviously this is a corner building so
they<00:01:51.750> utilize<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.860> turntable<00:01:53.159> piece<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
they utilize this turntable piece to

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.270 
they utilize this turntable piece to
build<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> door

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
build the door

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.130 
build the door
will<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.509> i<00:01:57.750> think

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
will be right there which i think

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
will be right there which i think
that'll<00:01:58.469> look<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.619> nice<00:01:59.180> but<00:02:00.180> overall<00:02:00.479> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that'll look pretty nice but overall I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.670 
that'll look pretty nice but overall I
gotta<00:02:00.990> say<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.280> design<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.680> I'm

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
interested to see how it changes those I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
interested to see how it changes those I
continued<00:02:08.220> build<00:02:08.429> because<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.209> have

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
think I definitely think it's gonna be

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.839 
think I definitely think it's gonna be
an<00:02:25.319> improvement<00:02:25.739> over<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> other<00:02:26.400> $100

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
an improvement over the other $100

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.750 
an improvement over the other $100
general<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:28.890> mean<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.220> already<00:02:29.489> had<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
general and I mean I already had a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
general and I mean I already had a
greengrocer<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> don't<00:02:30.930> need<00:02:31.049> too<00:02:31.290> many

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
greengrocer so I don't need too many

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.619 
greengrocer so I don't need too many
grocery<00:02:31.950> stores<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.519> I'll<00:02:33.120> probably<00:02:33.329> have<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
grocery stores so I'll probably have to

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.420 
grocery stores so I'll probably have to
put<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.959> some<00:02:34.079> more<00:02:34.260> stuff<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.769> plates

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
put in some more stuff like this plates

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.399 
put in some more stuff like this plates
dishes<00:02:35.849> different<00:02:36.450> things<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.140> place

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
dishes different things that this place

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.309 
dishes different things that this place
sells<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.450> guess<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.810> might<00:02:40.019> end<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.260> with

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
sells but I guess I might end up with

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.770 
sells but I guess I might end up with
just<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.709> couple<00:02:40.860> grocery<00:02:41.400> stores<00:02:41.659> well<00:02:42.659> you
