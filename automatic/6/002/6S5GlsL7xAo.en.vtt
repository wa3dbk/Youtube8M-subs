there's longboard I'm not exactly sure
if<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.549> might<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.790> only<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
if that's that might be only the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
if that's that might be only the
American<00:01:21.540> ego<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.170> below<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
American ego but that's like below the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.109 
American ego but that's like below the
knee<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.580> below<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> knee

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
knee like a little bit below the knee

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
knee like a little bit below the knee
but<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.570> my<00:01:24.720> cap<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.530> mine<00:01:25.830> Anthony

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
but I like my cap I like mine Anthony

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
but I like my cap I like mine Anthony
and<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.409> reason

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and so that's what these are the reason

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
and so that's what these are the reason
why<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.250> Hollister<00:01:29.759> shorts<00:01:30.090> as

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
why I only get Hollister shorts as

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
why I only get Hollister shorts as
because<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.229> American<00:01:31.650> Eagle

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
