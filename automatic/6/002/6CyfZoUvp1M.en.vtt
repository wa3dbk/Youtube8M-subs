00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.219
 this decoration that I will introduce you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.960
 for the tutorial so let's go so I have 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.020
 already laid a beautiful varnish 2 bat 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.090
 really i love them nico servers their 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.810
 club 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.340
 it's oysters at astral so it's a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.320
 very beautiful glitter polish that you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 can buy safe is that for us 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.350
 then I will use paint 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.620
 black acrylic this one from where maxim 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.410
 magnet shovels buckets raphael so for his 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 deco no need to make traits too 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.719
 too hungry on the contrary I can not too much 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.809
 give you indication all the fingers 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.940
 are not the same you have to do it is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.940
 really according to your inspiration 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:42.000
 when you see all my motives without 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:43.350
 large at the base and end in a point there 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 see what it gives you see it's 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.260
 a lot of weight was if you do 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.320
 the arabesques do not do them too much 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.380
 trophy is too black wanted there 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.940
 it's an emotional side tribal way so 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 really made the pattern like that you 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.000
 come on you see no such motive they 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 are all different on each finger 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 but try to do something 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 thing a corner you see I'm doing 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 always on the same corner so then 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 I will use these reasons it's up to 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.360
 wedge actors who also come from 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.810
 at his rates for us I'm already going 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.580
 start by cutting out the pattern that I 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 then want to take my little 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.310
 cup back and I'm going to drive them 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.640
 case in then I'm waiting for some 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 seconds 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.440
 I am then fished with my forceps 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.730
 epilate my little motor choirs and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.120
 I will come and push the pattern 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.120
 with my finger 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.920
 when they exceed you can 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:59.569
 catch up with the tweezers and you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.569
 put them where you want them 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.819
 japy very lightly to chase the air 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 you can also do it with a little 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.200
 tissue 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.410
 I will then use a benchmark 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.080
 sifting and ondo ching with a big 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.290
 bang would throw a little bit my back 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.220
 timba painting and I want to come do 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.220
 some full poems 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.760
 now i'm going to put my top coat 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:37.730
 but it is possible that with this varnish 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.260
 with sequins the small flowers face 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.000
 will delimit date this is because the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.040
 basic varnish and after all the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.630
 glitter is quite granular so either 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.860
 you put if you do not want it to do 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.360
 of tiny holes is really 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.790
 very discreet and frankly we see it 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.010
 not but if you really want this 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.200
 be perfect you put a varnish 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.880
 publish its base or so you pass 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.320
 first a layer of top coat before 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.660
 make your motive and ask your 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.110
 earth of holds and so when it's dry 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.470
 you spend your top coat 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.549
 So that's what it gives to the sun 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.650
 I hope this little decoration has you 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.650
 and I'll see you soon bye bye
