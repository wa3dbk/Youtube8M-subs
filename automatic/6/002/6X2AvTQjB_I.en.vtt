00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
pulley and then spin around the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.850 
pulley and then spin around the
carabiner<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:59.540> gate<00:01:59.750> opens<00:02:00.200> at<00:02:00.800> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
carabiner so the gate opens at the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.780 
carabiner so the gate opens at the
bottom<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.680> take<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> termination<00:02:04.340> end<00:02:04.550> and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
bottom and take the termination end and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.270 
bottom and take the termination end and
you<00:02:05.119> can<00:02:05.210> either<00:02:05.360> connect<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.280> middle

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can either connect it in the middle

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.260 
you can either connect it in the middle
hole<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.880> I've<00:02:08.119> done<00:02:08.300> here<00:02:11.350> or<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.800> also

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
hole like I've done here or you can also

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.140 
hole like I've done here or you can also
connect<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.450> through<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> top<00:02:15.080> hole<00:02:16.150> leaving

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
connect it through the top hole leaving

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.920 
connect it through the top hole leaving
the<00:02:17.270> middle<00:02:17.660> hole<00:02:18.200> available<00:02:19.150> which<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:20.480> I'll

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.310 
the middle hole available which as I'll
explain<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.180> beneficial<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:23.870> work

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
explain can be beneficial for work

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.940 
explain can be beneficial for work
positioning<00:02:24.980> systems

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850 

so<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> huge<00:02:33.280> benefit<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> using<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.860> pitch

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
so a huge benefit to using the pitch

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.980 
so a huge benefit to using the pitch
climb<00:02:36.160> ability<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:39.240> when<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.390> when<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.870> have

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
climb ability is when you when you have

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.730 
climb ability is when you when you have
it<00:02:41.140> all<00:02:41.230> set<00:02:41.500> up

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
it all set up

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.280 
it all set up
you<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.460> determination<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.300> either<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
you have determination in either the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.270 
you have determination in either the
middle<00:02:44.590> hole<00:02:44.830> or<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.370> top<00:02:45.790> hole<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:47.770> keeps

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
middle hole or the top hole it keeps

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.070 
middle hole or the top hole it keeps
everything<00:02:48.730> nice<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.360> line<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.900> there's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
everything nice and in line and there's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.950 
everything nice and in line and there's
up<00:02:50.200> because<00:02:50.500> there's<00:02:50.680> always<00:02:50.830> tension<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.460> it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
up because there's always tension on it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.630 
up because there's always tension on it
even<00:02:52.960> when<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.410> pull<00:02:53.740> down<00:02:54.640> from<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:55.030> bond<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
even when you pull down from a bond and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.070 
even when you pull down from a bond and
then<00:02:57.790> turn<00:02:58.330> your<00:02:58.570> slack<00:02:59.070> it<00:03:00.070> keeps<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:01.720> whole

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
then turn your slack it keeps this whole

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.670 
then turn your slack it keeps this whole
system<00:03:03.060> nice<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.300> tight<00:03:04.510> whereas<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.500> you're

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
system nice and tight whereas if you're

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.390 
system nice and tight whereas if you're
using<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:06.190> system<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.750> have<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
using a system that you have the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.790 
using a system that you have the
termination<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.360> carabiner<00:03:11.170> going<00:03:11.440> direct

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
termination and carabiner going direct

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.370

to<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.520> anchor<00:03:12.850> bridge<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.140> have

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
to the anchor bridge and then you have

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.240 
to the anchor bridge and then you have
just<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.400> single<00:03:15.820> point<00:03:16.210> attachment<00:03:16.780> pulley

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
your anchor bridge when you when you

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.350 
your anchor bridge when you when you
pull<00:03:24.310> down<00:03:24.870> from<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> bold<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:27.400> then<00:03:27.640> makes<00:03:27.910> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
pull down from a bold it then makes the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.060 
pull down from a bold it then makes the
pulley<00:03:29.050> on<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.380> single<00:03:29.770> point<00:03:29.920> attachment<00:03:30.750> go

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
pulley on a single point attachment go

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.699 
pulley on a single point attachment go
slack<00:03:33.690> because<00:03:34.690> you're<00:03:35.110> taking<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.560> weight

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
slack because you're taking the weight

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.410 
slack because you're taking the weight
off<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:36.370> then<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.180> slide<00:03:37.390> down

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
off of it so then that can slide down

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.540 
off of it so then that can slide down
your<00:03:37.810> bridge<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:38.230> everything<00:03:38.739> goes<00:03:38.950> taut<00:03:39.310> or

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
your bridge and everything goes taut or

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.979 
your bridge and everything goes taut or
slack<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.630> floppy<00:03:41.700> whereas<00:03:42.700> with<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.630> triple

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
slack and floppy whereas with the triple

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.560 
slack and floppy whereas with the triple
attachment<00:03:44.500> pulley<00:03:45.239> because<00:03:46.239> it's<00:03:46.420> all

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
attachment pulley because it's all

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.050 
attachment pulley because it's all
connected<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.980> pulley<00:03:48.220> there's<00:03:48.910> always

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
connected to the pulley there's always

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.630 
connected to the pulley there's always
tension<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.770> always<00:03:50.950> stays<00:03:51.340> there

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
tension on it so it always stays there

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.240 
tension on it so it always stays there
nice<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.510> firm<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.250> front<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.580> you

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.110 

so<00:03:57.580> just<00:03:57.760> keeps<00:03:57.940> everything<00:03:58.239> nice<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:58.930> tidy

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
so just keeps everything nice and tidy

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.720 
so just keeps everything nice and tidy
doesn't<00:04:01.120> flop<00:04:01.330> around<00:04:01.860> that's<00:04:02.860> why<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.520> play

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
doesn't flop around that's why this play

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.589 
doesn't flop around that's why this play
is<00:04:03.880> so<00:04:04.060> great<00:04:04.770> arborists<00:04:09.360> another<00:04:10.360> great

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
is so great arborists another great

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.800 
is so great arborists another great
benefit<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.739> hitch<00:04:12.550> pilot<00:04:12.940> pulley<00:04:13.150> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
benefit to the hitch pilot pulley is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.210 
benefit to the hitch pilot pulley is
because<00:04:14.110> there's<00:04:14.290> actually<00:04:14.440> three<00:04:14.800> points<00:04:15.130> of

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
because there's actually three points of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.580 
because there's actually three points of
attachment<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.269> pulley<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:16.780> you're<00:04:17.440> only

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
attachment on the pulley and you're only

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.250 
attachment on the pulley and you're only
using<00:04:17.769> two<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.250> them<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.609> leaves<00:04:18.970> one<00:04:19.959> hole

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
using two of them it leaves one hole

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
using two of them it leaves one hole
free<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:22.480> if<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.750> connect<00:04:23.200> your<00:04:23.470> termination

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
free so if you connect your termination

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.460 
free so if you connect your termination
into<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.820> top<00:04:25.030> hole<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:26.050> leaving<00:04:26.290> this

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
into the top hole it's leaving this

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.320 
into the top hole it's leaving this
middle<00:04:26.830> hole<00:04:27.010> free<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.880> where<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> can
