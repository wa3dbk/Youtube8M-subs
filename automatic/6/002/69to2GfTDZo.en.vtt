00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
just like being me I spent 28 years
following<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> lemurs<00:01:50.850> around<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.509> being<00:01:52.110> in

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
following the lemurs around and being in

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
following the lemurs around and being in
the<00:01:52.380> extraordinary<00:01:53.220> environment<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.060> then

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the extraordinary environment and then

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.380 
the extraordinary environment and then

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
suddenly we're all inside the rainforest

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
suddenly we're all inside the rainforest
or<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> tropical<00:01:58.590> dry<00:01:58.799> forest<00:01:59.280> or<00:01:59.490> wherever

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
able to go to Madagascar yes but our

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.580 
able to go to Madagascar yes but our
movies<00:02:14.450> like<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.840> perhaps<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.470> new

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
movies like this perhaps the new

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.620 
movies like this perhaps the new
frontier<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:16.070> how<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.310> better<00:02:16.520> learn<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.060> you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
frontier of how to better learn and you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.720 
frontier of how to better learn and you
know<00:02:17.690> see<00:02:17.930> animals<00:02:18.380> yeah<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> mean<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.430> certainly

years<00:05:09.310> ago<00:05:09.639> because<00:05:09.910> that's<00:05:10.180> how<00:05:10.270> they<00:05:10.389> got

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
years ago because that's how they got

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.450 
years ago because that's how they got
their<00:05:10.780> small<00:05:11.380> group<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.710> lemurs<00:05:12.070> really

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
their small group of lemurs really

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.090 
their small group of lemurs really
accidentally<00:05:13.120> got<00:05:13.389> washed<00:05:13.600> out<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.930> sea

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
accidentally got washed out to sea

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.000 
accidentally got washed out to sea
landed<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.160> Madagascar<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.199> in<00:05:17.199> Africa<00:05:17.650> you

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
landed in Madagascar and in Africa you

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.650 
landed in Madagascar and in Africa you
know<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.190> sort<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.460> lemur<00:05:18.789> ancestors<00:05:19.360> long

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
know that sort of lemur ancestors long

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.140 
know that sort of lemur ancestors long
extinct<00:05:20.169> but<00:05:20.289> they<00:05:20.410> only<00:05:20.760> survived<00:05:21.760> in

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
extinct but they only survived in

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.930 
extinct but they only survived in
Madagascar<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.550> we<00:05:24.550> thought<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.789> would<00:05:24.849> be

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
Madagascar so we thought it would be

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.790 
Madagascar so we thought it would be
pretty<00:05:25.210> interesting<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.990> you<00:05:26.139> know<00:05:26.229> dramatize

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
pretty interesting to you know dramatize

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.010 
pretty interesting to you know dramatize
their<00:05:27.099> journey<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.970> Madagascar<00:05:28.570> across<00:05:28.810> the

their journey to Madagascar across the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.440 
their journey to Madagascar across the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
sea and we had this crazy idea that was

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.120 
sea and we had this crazy idea that was
the<00:05:31.539> brainchild<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:32.289> dave<00:05:32.590> douglas<00:05:32.800> who

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
the brainchild of dave douglas who

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.860 
the brainchild of dave douglas who

lemurs to pass breaching whales on their
way<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.360> madagascar<00:05:38.050> so<00:05:38.229> we<00:05:38.320> built<00:05:38.590> this

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
way to madagascar so we built this

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.400

island<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.550> we<00:05:40.240> towed<00:05:40.539> it<00:05:40.570> out<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:41.169> sea<00:05:41.380> in

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
island and we towed it out to sea in

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.440 
island and we towed it out to sea in
madagascar<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.550> know<00:05:42.669> where<00:05:42.880> these<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.360> know

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450
