so<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.920> favorite<00:00:50.129> combination<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so this is my favorite combination of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
so this is my favorite combination of
folks<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:52.670> say<00:00:54.199> semi<00:00:55.199> tanks

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
folks to use of it really say semi tanks

destroying<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.570> when<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.629> can't<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:57.899> do

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
destroying thing when I can't really do

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
destroying thing when I can't really do
much<00:00:58.079> damage<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.649> them<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> idea<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
much damage to them but the idea is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
much damage to them but the idea is
basically<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.680> run<00:01:02.430> around<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.120> unprotected

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
basically I run around and unprotected

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
basically I run around and unprotected
from<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> tanks<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.330> I've<00:01:06.330> got<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> sticky

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
from the tanks so I've got a sticky

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
from the tanks so I've got a sticky
grenade<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:08.340> any<00:01:08.520> good<00:01:09.530> do<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> little

pretty<00:02:09.110> close<00:02:09.289> range<00:02:09.619> i<00:02:09.769> find<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.099> it's<00:02:10.280> best

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
pretty close range i find that it's best

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.020 
pretty close range i find that it's best
to<00:02:10.579> use<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.910> single<00:02:11.720> shots<00:02:11.930> or<00:02:12.140> little<00:02:12.349> bursts
