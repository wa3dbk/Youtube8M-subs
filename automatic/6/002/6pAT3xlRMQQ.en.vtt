just a little bit but that's okay we can

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
more complicated this is just the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
more complicated this is just the
simplest<00:02:21.700> way<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.420> think<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.410> make<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:25.570> might

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.140 
simplest way I think to make it it might
not<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.650> way<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.190> love<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:28.000> you're
