00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.039
 hello hello that such welcome friends a 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.259
 new video then this time with a 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.480
 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 gameplay 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.400
 background and myself because I recorded it I'm 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.289
 just starting I'm dating so 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.900
 know how to excuse the bad game that is 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.720
 well put in the background but today we come 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.580
 to talk about what will be a theme 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.560
 very important a subject that then without 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 doubtless they ask me day by day in 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.290
 my channel and well 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.150
 how to be part of machine emma all of us 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 we asked or asked 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.600
 ask also how to be bread imagined 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 we all know what machinima is one of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 the network but the most one of them the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 most important of all youtube and then 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.650
 well many people want to form 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.110
 part of this network as I do 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.820
 I made some time ago because as 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.769
 you know I had my previous channel with 8 thousand 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.629
 subscribers I could not be a partner because 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.220
 well, at that time there was no 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.680
 much limitation in what has been 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.180
 youtube and all this my country did not count 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.309
 with the partner service but 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 they existed the networks emerged 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.710
 sorry and good now we have machine 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 emma tgn many network more than then without 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.660
 place to doubt are a step to get 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 to the YouTube partner now 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.740
 practically all users with a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.899
 pair of videos of certain type of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 reproductions already have the partner 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.759
 activated well to be a partner of 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.410
 machinima we have requirements before 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.810
 it was very difficult to be 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.300
 partner not anyone got it and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 well you had to have a very high cpm 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.049
 to get there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 be part of machismo what happened there 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.939
 drown alone 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.540
 good but good we're still here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.270
 let's propose them 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.010
 to read more than all the requirements 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.190
 minimums that are needed to enter 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.620
 the maximum network this time the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.800
 first no copyright problem in 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.260
 your channel and nothing else to emphasize that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 Well, no channel that has an action 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.200
 of cooperation to see the actions of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 copyright today not the design of 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.600
 youtube are going to go there to your channel in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.030
 channel configuration and then in settings 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.130
 of the channel it seems to me they are there what 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.600
 comes being copyright rules of the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.660
 community and all this you have to 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.490
 have all those three little things in what 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.459
 is going to be green that is to say that they are in a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.440
 good condition for you to apply for 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.290
 the partner in this case very important 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.720
 the machinima as well if you have 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 some option the shares of copec and 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.640
 so after six months 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.739
 Of course, if you delete the videos that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.780
 have macon of more content not 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.150
 You can profit from a content that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.530
 not exclusively yours so as 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.390
 if you have videos with background music 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.370
 even that they are not pages 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.320
 authorized without copyright because you 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.940
 I recommend deleting those videos and start 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.690
 again to make the content that then 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.240
 I can 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.420
 to be a partner in the future, well 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.030
 in another it would be a minimum of 500 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.120
 subscribers if before machinima not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.950
 good told or exposes a base 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.510
 minimum subscribers was very exaggerated 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.670
 compared to the one that puts us today 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 that's good, it's around 500 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.780
 we are going to be so precise, it should be stressed 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.180
 that the network always decides whether to accept 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.710
 or not so you have what you have but good 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.780
 It also depends on your content a lot 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.840
 but not a minimum of 500 subscribers 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.600
 that most of you imagine that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.580
 You can achieve to have them depends on your 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.310
 work everything depends on perseverance and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.610
 of their work that they perform a minimum of 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 10 or 15 videos uploaded here I want to do 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.770
 a particular emphasis since then I 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.230
 when I started this new channel just 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.910
 It's been eight months since I started 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 with this new channel I uploaded a video 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.320
 spending two days a video going on three 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.810
 days and well I tried to climb as much 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.750
 constant I can and can do 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.330
 videos also very much with a lot 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.580
 quality very clearly so that the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.569
 people like it no and so we can 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.730
 get to the cpm 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.670
 of reproductions that later on 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.280
 I am going to give this as I say it is 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.290
 question of constancy is a matter of no 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.170
 never lower your arms and then nothing 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.079
 machinima me when he accepted me more I 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.370
 I had 460 subscribers plus I put him 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.810
 my example so that you do not know 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.630
 discourage for you to follow 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.759
 getting him to go ahead and well I 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.550
 when I entered machinima I had 460 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.900
 subscribers machinima I sent you the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.820
 request to machin and more as you 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.949
 we send the request below it will be 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.870
 at the bottom of the web page 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.910
 officer of machinima you can go 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.470
 to contact there and send your request for 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.729
 the contact part I recommend 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.930
 translate the page 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.220
 logically that it will be in 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.350
 English 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.390
 translate a page go to contact in 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.060
 Affiliates and send an email requesting 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.670
 the partner for example what do I know I have 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.310
 my channel such specific urls in the 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.810
 message does not give you as well as the others 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.370
 network a step- by-step form 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.440
 or nothing you have to request them 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.490
 verify as soon as possible 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.100
 they answer good as I say 10 to 15 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.620
 videos and if you can do it better one 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.420
 or two videos every three or four days is 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.730
 much better many more 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.870
 possibilities your sales by 30% 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.240
 possibilities of being a partner with 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.520
 machinima and well well nothing more that and 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.770
 another thing that is very important I think 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.810
 that everything important comes to 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.850
 from this to machinima he likes 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.700
 a lot of perseverance as I told them 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.700
 I said a little while ago and it also puts 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.780
 a range of visits to your channel or visits 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.250
 to your videos 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.870
 you are going to enter the social page 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.790
 blake I'll leave it to you in the part 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.380
 below also the social link the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.940
 most of you already know it 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.940
 most of you have already seen your 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.560
 statistics on that page and then you 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.230
 they will go in there and they will visualize the 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.280
 views of your videos but monthly 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.050
 in change beats I think but monthly 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.180
 past the 30 days is in the part of 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.760
 down must have a minimum of 10 thousand 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.639
 monthly visits me in this case then 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:06.020
 Today I have one with 105 thousand 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.940
 monthly visits and with 3500 daily 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.950
 daily also take a little into account 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.600
 but knowing that you are starting and 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.190
 that you want to be part of they are going to 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.320
 take into account the 10,000 visits 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.790
 monthly on your channel I tell you 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.770
 check it in social see in the part of 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.270
 down and well I think that would be 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.460
 all the requirements that machin emma us 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.410
 ask now that if I give you an advice it is 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.830
 please never lower your arms be very 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.430
 constant sends the request deals with 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.940
 be the most critical with your channel if in 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.940
 something you have wrong 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.639
 correct it treats it well to the people who 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.090
 follow that you see your videos is very 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.979
 important and good machinima will already be 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.240
 to machin emma decision when all 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.820
 they said he kept could not get in 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.300
 nobody me with 640 subscribers and with 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.830
 less than a thousand visits on my channel I went in and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.840
 well they fixed my work a lot 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.020
 they were very set in my constancy 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.910
 they set a lot in the quality of my 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.850
 videos and that's very important is the 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.919
 base nothing is impossible here only depends 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.270

 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.770
 I think we have to try some that 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.820
 another topic plus the links remember is going to 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.470
 be in the description of the video 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.660
