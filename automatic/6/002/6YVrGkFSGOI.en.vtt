have several holes you can move it back
in<00:01:20.400> through<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> hole<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.070> basically<00:01:23.070> lock

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
in through the hole and basically lock

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.179 
in through the hole and basically lock
the<00:01:23.939> button<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.330> place<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the button into place so right now you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
the button into place so right now you
can<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.820> slide<00:01:27.090> pretty<00:01:27.420> much<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.960> over

the place but if I wanted to give this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.340 
the place but if I wanted to give this
one<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.070> locked<00:01:32.340> position

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
one a little more of a locked position

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.719

through the opposite hole and what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
through the opposite hole and what
that's<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.299> that's<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.509> provide

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that's gonna do is that's gonna provide

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's gonna do is that's gonna provide
more<00:01:40.710> friction<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.780> button<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
more friction for this button to have to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.010 
more friction for this button to have to
overcome<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.460> wants<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> slide<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
overcome if it wants to slide down the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
overcome if it wants to slide down the
ribbon<00:01:48.979> just<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.509> as<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.659> see

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
ribbon just like that as you can see

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.289 
ribbon just like that as you can see
it's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.640> more<00:01:53.759> difficult<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's a little bit more difficult it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.639 
it's a little bit more difficult it
still<00:01:54.479> has<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.630> play<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> little

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
still has some play but it's a little

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
still has some play but it's a little
bit<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.860> difficult<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.549> slide<00:01:56.820> now

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
bit more difficult for it to slide now

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580
