00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.660 
this one up
um<00:02:34.590> which<00:02:35.590> should<00:02:35.920> look<00:02:36.159> like<00:02:36.189> this<00:02:37.349> um<00:02:38.670> you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
um which should look like this um you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.089 
um which should look like this um you
it's<00:02:40.060> optional<00:02:40.569> properties<00:02:41.019> pieces<00:02:41.409> out<00:02:41.530> but

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
it's optional properties pieces out but

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.910 
it's optional properties pieces out but
you<00:02:42.639> probably<00:02:42.969> will<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.659> put<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.109> mirror<00:02:44.409> in<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you probably will to put a mirror in I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.649 
you probably will to put a mirror in I
met<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:46.200> picture<00:02:47.489> Amal<00:02:48.489> anything<00:02:48.939> like<00:02:49.150> anyways

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
met a picture Amal anything like anyways

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.190 
met a picture Amal anything like anyways
so<00:02:50.290> yeah<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.370> then<00:02:51.489> you'll<00:02:51.700> design<00:02:52.120> around<00:02:52.810> it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
so yeah and then you'll design around it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.229 
so yeah and then you'll design around it
so<00:02:53.889> yeah<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:55.469> this<00:02:56.469> piece<00:02:57.010> comes<00:02:57.459> off<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.180> you

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
so yeah and this piece comes off so you

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.629 
so yeah and this piece comes off so you
can<00:02:58.450> design<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:59.049> too<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:02.400> let's<00:03:03.400> actually

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
can design that too so let's actually

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.319 
can design that too so let's actually
like<00:03:04.419> starch<00:03:05.139> using<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.159> divot<00:03:06.549> cheese<00:03:06.760> so

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
like starch using the divot cheese so

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.720 
like starch using the divot cheese so
first<00:03:07.780> I'm<00:03:07.900> going<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.049> under<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.439> cat<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.980> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
first I'm going to under the cat and it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.699 
first I'm going to under the cat and it
should<00:03:09.969> have<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.450> little<00:03:10.659> doughy<00:03:11.109> look<00:03:11.530> in

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
should have this little doughy look in

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.439 
should have this little doughy look in
there<00:03:11.889> you<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:13.269> looks<00:03:13.299> kind<00:03:13.719> of<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.449> if

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
there you see it looks kind of it and if

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.199 
there you see it looks kind of it and if
you<00:03:16.569> were<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> put<00:03:17.139> it<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.409> this<00:03:18.010> tube<00:03:18.549> on<00:03:18.760> your

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
you were to put it on this tube on your

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.339 
you were to put it on this tube on your
bail<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:20.169> would<00:03:20.319> push<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:22.120> one<00:03:22.329> any<00:03:23.019> twists

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
bail you would push it one any twists

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.789 
bail you would push it one any twists
and<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:23.949> it<00:03:24.069> go<00:03:24.250> up<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.150> want<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.449> data

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
and then it go up but I want the data

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.339 
and then it go up but I want the data
right<00:03:26.799> there<00:03:27.010> step<00:03:27.719> here<00:03:28.719> and<00:03:28.810> put<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:28.989> step

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
right there step here and put this step

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.619 
right there step here and put this step
aside<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:30.159> want<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.519> place<00:03:30.909> it<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.180> with

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
aside and you want to place it in with

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.420 
aside and you want to place it in with
this<00:03:31.810> sorry<00:03:32.699> too<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:35.079> grabbed<00:03:35.409> it<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.829> then

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:36.270 

that's<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.480> air<00:04:08.260> me<00:04:08.470> ok<00:04:08.950> sap

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
like I just hate a hate that you have to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.360 
like I just hate a hate that you have to
get<00:05:23.190> parts<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:23.940> your<00:05:24.120> tube<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:25.050> think<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.130> you

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
get parts of your tube I think that you

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.080 
get parts of your tube I think that you
could<00:05:26.490> be<00:05:26.580> using<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:27.480> be<00:05:27.600> designing<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:29.130> just

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
could be using to be designing and just

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.700 
could be using to be designing and just
you<00:05:30.180> have<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.450> use<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.840> put<00:05:31.260> these<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.680> my

you have to use it to put these on my
lips<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:33.440> that's<00:05:34.440> what<00:05:35.430> I<00:05:35.960> quit<00:05:37.490> don't<00:05:38.490> like
