table with everything together I like to

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.870 
table with everything together I like to
just<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> snug<00:01:16.800> so<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> it'll<00:01:17.520> hold<00:01:17.700> its

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
just get it snug so that it'll hold its

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
just get it snug so that it'll hold its
position<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.630> come<00:01:18.870> back<00:01:18.900> later<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.470> do

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
position and then come back later and do

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
position and then come back later and do
all<00:01:19.740> final<00:01:20.160> adjustments<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.030> moving<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the crank arm down bring it to tension

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.960 
the crank arm down bring it to tension
and<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:46.890> she<00:01:47.100> wrote<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
wheels into the bike again I like to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450 
wheels into the bike again I like to
start<00:01:51.690> front<00:01:51.990> wheel<00:01:52.110> first<00:01:52.410> just<00:01:52.740> slam<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.370> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
start front wheel first just slam it in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
stained now that the rear wheel snug as

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.760 
stained now that the rear wheel snug as
far<00:01:57.540> forward<00:01:57.720> as<00:01:57.960> possible<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.650> gonna

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
far forward as possible I'm gonna

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
far forward as possible I'm gonna
measure<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.190> piece<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.790> chain<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.330> allows

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
measure out a piece of chain that allows

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
measure out a piece of chain that allows
me<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.410> enough<00:02:01.680> space<00:02:01.980> so<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:02.790> get

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
me just enough space so that when I get

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.690 
me just enough space so that when I get
a<00:02:03.030> flat<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.870> loosen<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.470> back<00:02:04.680> wheel<00:02:04.860> push

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
a flat I can loosen my back wheel push

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.010 
a flat I can loosen my back wheel push
it<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.300> bit<00:02:06.450> forward<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it just a little bit forward and it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.509 
it just a little bit forward and it
makes<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> remove<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.160> chain<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
makes it easy to remove the chain and

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.889 
makes it easy to remove the chain and
get<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> back<00:02:08.910> wheel<00:02:09.119> out<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.690> with

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
get the back wheel out now with

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.729 
get the back wheel out now with
everything<00:02:10.319> together

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
everything together

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.400 
everything together
I<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.700> tension<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.330> chain<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:12.900> there's<00:02:13.170> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I will tension the chain so there's just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
I will tension the chain so there's just
a<00:02:13.500> little<00:02:13.710> bit<00:02:13.830> amount<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.250> slack<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:14.850> that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
a little bit amount of slack so that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.690 
a little bit amount of slack so that
it's<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.300> grinding<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.960> your<00:02:16.110> gears<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
it's not grinding on your gears and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.910 
it's not grinding on your gears and
friction<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:17.870> with<00:02:18.080> all<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.290> I'll<00:02:18.650> pull

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
friction so now with all that I'll pull

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.559 
friction so now with all that I'll pull
the<00:02:19.069> bike<00:02:19.220> down<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.090> do<00:02:20.420> all

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
the bike down and I like to just do all

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.750 
the bike down and I like to just do all
final<00:02:20.989> adjustments<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:22.430> make<00:02:22.580> sure

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
final adjustments just make sure

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.840 
final adjustments just make sure
everything<00:02:23.270> snug<00:02:23.540> be
