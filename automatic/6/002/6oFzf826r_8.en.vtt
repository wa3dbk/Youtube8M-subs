00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
today since I'm harvesting burdock is we

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880 
today since I'm harvesting burdock is we
get<00:00:13.830> these<00:00:14.009> big<00:00:14.249> leaves<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.650> many<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
get these big leaves and many of the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.340 
get these big leaves and many of the
pioneers<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> old-time<00:00:18.420> people<00:00:18.840> would

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
pioneers and the old-time people would

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.050 
pioneers and the old-time people would
wrap<00:00:19.590> their<00:00:19.859> meat<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.519> burdock<00:00:20.789> leaves

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
wrap their meat in the burdock leaves

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820 
wrap their meat in the burdock leaves
and<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:21.630> throw<00:00:21.929> it<00:00:22.019> into<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> fire<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
and then throw it into the fire or the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.759 
and then throw it into the fire or the
coals<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.310> cook<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:24.060> would<00:00:24.179> keep<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.480> moist

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
coals to cook it it would keep it moist

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.109 
coals to cook it it would keep it moist
keep<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.890> from<00:00:26.039> burning<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.820> would<00:00:26.939> add<00:00:27.089> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
keep it from burning and it would add a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.689 
keep it from burning and it would add a
flavor<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.890> I'm<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.039> gonna<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
flavor to it I'm not gonna do it in the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.030 
flavor to it I'm not gonna do it in the
fire<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> oven

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
fire I'm gonna put it in the oven

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.230 
fire I'm gonna put it in the oven
because<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.369> more<00:00:32.580> interested<00:00:32.820> in

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
because of what I'm more interested in

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.180 
because of what I'm more interested in
is<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:34.080> flavor<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.710> give<00:00:34.920> because

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
is what flavor it would give because

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.090 
is what flavor it would give because
when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.430> eat<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.820> leaves<00:00:36.090> they're<00:00:36.480> bitter

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
when you eat these leaves they're bitter

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.200 
when you eat these leaves they're bitter
so<00:00:38.100> anyway<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.059> some

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so anyway we're gonna try it with some

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
so anyway we're gonna try it with some
pork<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.690> gonna<00:00:40.230> find<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.559> bigger<00:00:40.890> leaves<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:36.719 

three<00:01:27.490> stood<00:01:28.330> like<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:28.600> here<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:35.729> little

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
three stood like this here a little

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:58.230 
three stood like this here a little
seasoning<00:01:37.180> on<00:01:37.330> there

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.100 

all<00:01:59.240> right<00:01:59.360> well<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.480> was<00:01:59.600> gonna<00:01:59.660> put<00:01:59.930> it<00:01:59.990> into

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
all right well I was gonna put it into

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.750 
all right well I was gonna put it into
like<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> cake<00:02:00.710> pan<00:02:01.010> or<00:02:01.250> something<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:01.730> I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
like a cake pan or something but I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.430 
like a cake pan or something but I
decided<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.330> use<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.480> bread<00:02:02.780> pan<00:02:02.960> instead

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
decided to use a bread pan instead

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.930 
decided to use a bread pan instead
because<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:04.010> tuck<00:02:04.160> it<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.700> won't

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
because I can tuck it in and this won't

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.910 
because I can tuck it in and this won't
pop<00:02:05.150> loose<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.540> everything<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.650> of<00:02:06.740> times

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
pop loose and everything a lot of times

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.889 
pop loose and everything a lot of times
when<00:02:07.100> they<00:02:07.190> do<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.520> over<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> fire<00:02:08.630> you'll

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
when they do this over a fire you'll

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.780 
when they do this over a fire you'll
take<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.320> put<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> leaf<00:02:09.860> by<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.220> fire<00:02:10.520> for<00:02:10.759> a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
take and put the leaf by the fire for a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.400 
take and put the leaf by the fire for a
couple<00:02:11.030> minutes<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.330> wilt<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.110> bends

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
couple minutes to wilt it so it bends

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.620 
couple minutes to wilt it so it bends
easier<00:02:12.830> but<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.180> big<00:02:14.420> leave

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
easier but this is a really big leave

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.240 
easier but this is a really big leave
and<00:02:15.020> we're<00:02:15.200> not<00:02:15.260> having<00:02:15.560> any<00:02:15.650> trouble<00:02:15.920> itself

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and we're not having any trouble itself

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370 
and we're not having any trouble itself
all<00:02:16.820> right<00:02:16.970> I'm<00:02:17.060> gonna<00:02:17.150> throw<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> into<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.630> 350

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
all right I'm gonna throw it into a 350

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.090 
all right I'm gonna throw it into a 350
