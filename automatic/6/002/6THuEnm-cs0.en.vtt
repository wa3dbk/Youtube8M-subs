00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
competing the point where I really

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.450 
competing the point where I really
started<00:01:18.109> to<00:01:18.319> realize<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.649> something

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
started to realize that something

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.249 
started to realize that something
special<00:01:19.609> was<00:01:19.909> happening<00:01:20.030> was<00:01:20.659> when<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:20.869> did<00:01:21.109> win

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
special was happening was when I did win

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.559 
special was happening was when I did win
my<00:01:21.409> first<00:01:21.649> national<00:01:22.639> title<00:01:22.819> and<00:01:23.179> that<00:01:23.420> was

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
my first national title and that was

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.410 
my first national title and that was
after<00:01:23.929> I<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.920> graduated<00:01:25.310> high<00:01:25.490> school<00:01:25.520> it

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
after I just graduated high school it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.969 
after I just graduated high school it
was<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.810> point<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.319> I<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.799> thought

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
was that point that I really thought

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.069 
was that point that I really thought
maybe<00:01:28.249> I<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.609> you<00:01:28.909> know<00:01:28.999> keep<00:01:29.209> going<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.869> it

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
maybe I can you know keep going and it

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.980 
maybe I can you know keep going and it
kind<00:01:30.319> of<00:01:30.469> wasn't<00:01:31.009> until<00:01:31.459> a<00:01:31.729> year<00:01:31.909> before<00:01:32.389> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
kind of wasn't until a year before the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.379 
kind of wasn't until a year before the
OA<00:01:33.859> trials<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.639> really<00:01:34.939> thought<00:01:35.149> that<00:01:35.209> I

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
OA trials that I really thought that I

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:37.959 
OA trials that I really thought that I
could<00:01:35.509> make<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.049> team<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:37.399> have<00:01:37.520> put<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.819> so

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
could make the team you have put in so

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:39.760 
could make the team you have put in so
much<00:01:38.090> hard<00:01:38.149> work<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.780> effort<00:01:39.109> and<00:01:39.319> it<00:01:39.649> all

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
much hard work and effort and it all

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.980 
much hard work and effort and it all
comes<00:01:39.979> down<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.280> one<00:01:41.270> minute<00:01:41.539> two<00:01:41.689> minutes

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
comes down to one minute two minutes

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.050 
comes down to one minute two minutes
however<00:01:42.200> long<00:01:42.469> you're<00:01:42.649> racing<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.219> for<00:01:43.880> me
