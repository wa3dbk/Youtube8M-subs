00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 Hi there, this is a small video about imax 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.639
 b6 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 Here I have a new firmware version 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 the old the temper on stage first in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.160
 future I will see you in the next video 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.029
 I'll probably tell you about my new system 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.779
 but in this video I wanted 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 couple of such things to tell very 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.210
 First of all, this device is not 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.399
 fully charges the batteries 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.059
 car 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.719
 also does not fully charge 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.040
 screwdrivers and drills product with us 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 nickel cadmium and ion batteries with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 what is the reason I do not know everything is fine 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.289
 tested on factory charges on 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.129
 factory charges even this board and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 board charges damn I do not know much 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 better battery before cutoff 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 aimax it turns off earlier and when 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.250
 This battery does not remain until 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.010
 charged that is literally enough but 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.840
 me for 10 minutes of hard work 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.850
 charging from max and from normal charging 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 two hours by three 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 constantly working that keep this in mind also 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.159
 about charging conventional batteries 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.520
 and the clock on the test discharged 2 7 volts 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 I want to watch quickly and charging 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.020
 what capacity will it show but honestly 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.420
 saying i don't know how this all applies 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.360
 Deal to the original will buy the original 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.310
 then the future and accordingly but by 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.070
 crafts 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.409
 I will immediately say that the fake does not charge 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.649
 properly they finish reading like 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.659
 right but not up charges that is 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.610
 acquiring such a device for 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.799
 many way to acquire to charge 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.840
 here are the usual car batteries 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.340
 not only do you have a risk of it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.690
 burn it so you still completely 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 to charge 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.230
 it's all about intelligence there 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.540
 laid down that is by firmware and by mode 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 the choice of charging batteries that is 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.800
 very difficult to find it necessary to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.860
 mode seems to say that one hundred percent 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.360
 charged in fact for some reason a hundred 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.090
 percent not charging 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.310
 if there on some batteries here 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.730
 This here still passes until that is on small 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.090
 the amount that I tested I straight 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.040
 saw that up lithium ion batteries 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.560
 it's charging one by one therefore 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.900
 balancing nafig not needed from here 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.540
 reproaches to the address that I charge 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.300
 wrong i charge first a little bit 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.820
 thing the whole block while the voltage is a little bit 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.060
 no not balance then charges by 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.390
 alone and therefore I do not use on my 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.390
 video 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.910
 additional connector for balancer 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.570
 from here I am in principle and do not even know what is there 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.800
 he does like there he is no no just on 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.520
 it is not necessary to calculate the capacity not the capacity 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.540
 need to count 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.940
 bank but not the total 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.070
 from here how would you draw conclusions 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 that is, if you need to count 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.959
 some power I do not recommend 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.670
 use a little something that fake either 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.890
 some such version 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 see the original but honestly I 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.709
 You say this as the original very 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.950
 many fakes 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.110
 from china original not shipped there 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.750
 Immediately I say that is if you will 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.300
 buy it on aliexpress there 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.810
 there are no originals but no 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.790
 they are there but they stand there for two s 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.480
 half three times as much as not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.140
 the original of them 4 now these have appeared 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.269
 new in the us they have a price tag from 7,000 there to 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.510
 10 amps and that is what I wanted on the site 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.660
 throw a reference well there are such things 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.890
 already respectable there with ten due to 13,000 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.630
 eat in rubles 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:21.740
 I do not remember how much it is in dollars at 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.870
 this course is 57 now but 57 divided by 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.730
 13 thousand and you find out there some 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.460
 solid company produces 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.220
 in general, those allows up to 20 amps 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.630
 charge and discharge and see 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.970
 respectively power peak 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.610
 so anyone interested can try 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.040
 happiness there but in the Chinese market it is so 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.230
 I will say that if you take it is just not 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.450
 charging and counter 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.300
 here's a bigger counter this whole thing is not 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.280
 moves but if you want one hundred 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.990
 percent charge the battery that you have 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 he normally rose recommend 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.160
 use all those mains chargers 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.320
 devices 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.210
 much more efficient is obtained than here 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.180
 precisely these in a row 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.430
 that is, it may be approximately 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.650
 show you correctly yes capacity which 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.080
 did not run but the battery does not charge 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.060
 capacitor accumulates energy yes 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.480
 no recovery here 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.180
 occurs by outflow 0 0 1 amp charge 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.880
 it's a very long time that is you don't know 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.979
 who have enough power there though the usual charge 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.770
 3 amps on i charges much faster 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.870
 because neither is there a property in the program 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.130
 de sulfates and in modern many there 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.479
 Well, in short, that's what I wanted 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.880
 tell you about them 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.729
 that is, roughly speaking, this toy is like 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.410
 counter and overpay for some 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.900
 brands in order to try 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.700
 charge and great to work 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.040
 the battery is not worth it I use it 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.130
 Just as a quick start check the capacity 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.919
 all charging on the usual charge and he 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.610
 injection molding device 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.080
 faces you for a cadmium their cadmium then 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.419
 there is such a makara 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.560
 Only now these devices can 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:12.240
 used on this all interesting yet 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.430
 he said to me at 18:00 defused 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.680
 its one hundred percent that is i will be in 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.880
 shocked if he 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.430
 whether less entertain will write here now 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.440
 just one amp on ran on must 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.970
 be 18 13th 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.500
 they are already charging the wrong ends 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.110
 Russian charger on 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.830
 which already principle enough clones and 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:41.410
 in china from here 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:44.060
 then the device charges and that device 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.960
 unfortunately not completely grandfather percent on 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.789
 70 charges the battery capacity and everything 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.449
 then you just have to catch up with his charge 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.660
 thank you all for your attention everyone good luck 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.660
 until
