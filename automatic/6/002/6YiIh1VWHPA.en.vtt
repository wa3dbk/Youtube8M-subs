a<00:04:41.720> side<00:04:43.479> as<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.900> little<00:04:45.410> thing<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:46.039> you<00:04:46.310> can

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
a side as a little thing that you can

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.789 
a side as a little thing that you can
use<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.729> push<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:48.460> that's<00:04:49.460> cool
