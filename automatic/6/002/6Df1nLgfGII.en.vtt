00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
supposed to be on this trap right here

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.440 
supposed to be on this trap right here
but<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.229> looks<00:01:42.259> like<00:01:42.679> my<00:01:42.920> video<00:01:43.340> card<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:44.030> or

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
but it looks like my video card is or

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.679 
but it looks like my video card is or
rather<00:01:45.170> my<00:01:45.590> video<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.700> processing<00:01:47.359> it<00:01:47.509> as

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
rather my video is processing it as

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.590 
rather my video is processing it as
somewhere<00:01:48.229> else<00:01:48.350> I'm<00:01:48.820> sure<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.030> actually<00:01:50.479> on

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
somewhere else I'm sure it's actually on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.630 
somewhere else I'm sure it's actually on
here<00:01:50.840> though<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.829> goes<00:01:52.009> around<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.520> around

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
here though it goes around and around

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.029 
here though it goes around and around
and<00:01:54.999> these<00:01:55.999> buttons<00:01:56.659> are<00:01:56.929> connected<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.740> these

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
and these buttons are connected to these

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.410 
and these buttons are connected to these
switches<00:01:58.659> so<00:01:59.659> if<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.200> turn<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.039> switch<00:02:01.420> it's

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
switches so if you turn on a switch it's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.399 
switches so if you turn on a switch it's
going<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.749> exit<00:02:03.170> its<00:02:03.909> rotary<00:02:04.909> track<00:02:05.299> shoot<00:02:06.229> off

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
there you go round in circles let's take

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.060 
there you go round in circles let's take
a<00:04:12.890> look<00:04:13.190> at<00:04:13.400> these<00:04:13.930> junctions<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:17.950> go<00:04:18.950> over

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
a look at these junctions so go over

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.600 
a look at these junctions so go over
here<00:04:19.630> here's<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.750> switch<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.320> switch<00:04:21.620> runs

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
here here's a switch this switch runs

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.600 
to the switch all right you'll have to
excuse<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:43.530> skip<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.280> did<00:04:44.460> in

to make this little exit because my

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.310 
to make this little exit because my
videos<00:04:48.600> are<00:04:48.720> running<00:04:49.050> way<00:04:49.290> too<00:04:49.320> long<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:51.320> yeah

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
videos are running way too long so yeah

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.670 
videos are running way too long so yeah
so<00:04:52.590> we're<00:04:52.860> back<00:04:53.010> up<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.870> switch<00:04:55.230> takes

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
so we're back up here the switch takes

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.710 
so we're back up here the switch takes
you<00:04:55.889> off<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.340> main<00:04:56.520> line<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.260> onto<00:04:58.610> this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
you off the main line and onto this

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.050 
you off the main line and onto this
intermediate<00:05:00.720> track<00:05:01.580> where<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.700> would<00:05:02.820> stop

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
intermediate track where you would stop

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.080 
intermediate track where you would stop
here<00:05:03.830> again<00:05:04.830> same<00:05:05.160> instructions<00:05:05.669> these<00:05:05.850> lever

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
here again same instructions these lever

then press button down equals southbound

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.310 
then press button down equals southbound
of<00:05:08.669> equals<00:05:09.030> northbound<00:05:09.450> we<00:05:09.690> don't<00:05:09.780> have<00:05:09.960> any

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320

cities<00:05:10.710> on<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:11.010> rail<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.520> it's<00:05:11.880> just<00:05:12.150> north

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
cities on this rail so it's just north

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.280 
cities on this rail so it's just north
and<00:05:12.600> south<00:05:12.810> right<00:05:13.080> now<00:05:14.690> I'll<00:05:15.690> hear<00:05:15.810> my<00:05:15.960> squeaky

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
and south right now I'll hear my squeaky

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.290 
and south right now I'll hear my squeaky
chair<00:05:16.470> in<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.620> background<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.270> a

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
chair in the background and this is a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.300 
chair in the background and this is a
little<00:05:18.540> different<00:05:18.660> this<00:05:19.530> is<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> more<00:05:19.979> compact

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
little different this is a more compact

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.219 
little different this is a more compact
set<00:05:20.639> up<00:05:20.760> because<00:05:21.120> we're<00:05:21.270> coming<00:05:21.600> off<00:05:21.780> of<00:05:21.810> a

mainline we're just going in one

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.920 
mainline we're just going in one
direction<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.880> there's<00:05:27.270> no<00:05:27.419> need<00:05:27.690> for<00:05:27.720> that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
direction so there's no need for that

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.090

down equals south up equals northbound

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.950 
down equals south up equals northbound
so<00:06:11.070> again<00:06:11.550> we<00:06:11.880> have<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.060> same<00:06:12.240> situation<00:06:12.750> here

make<00:06:42.000> sure<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.240> your<00:06:42.800> detector<00:06:43.800> rail<00:06:44.040> is<00:06:44.310> not

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
make sure that your detector rail is not

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.820 
make sure that your detector rail is not
right<00:06:45.270> at<00:06:45.419> the<00:06:45.540> switch<00:06:45.810> because<00:06:46.500> what<00:06:46.710> will

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
right at the switch because what will

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.029 
right at the switch because what will
happen<00:06:46.919> is<00:06:47.460> when<00:06:47.820> your<00:06:47.940> car<00:06:48.180> comes<00:06:48.479> in<00:06:49.009> it<00:06:50.009> will

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
happen is when your car comes in it will

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.460 
happen is when your car comes in it will

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
try to go this way but it'll just get

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.140 
try to go this way but it'll just get
pushed<00:06:52.740> this<00:06:52.889> way<00:06:53.070> because<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.699> detector

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
pushed this way because the detector

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.090 
pushed this way because the detector
