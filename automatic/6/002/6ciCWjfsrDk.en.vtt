00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for example I could be like once upon a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
for example I could be like once upon a
time<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.149> Jordan<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
time and then Jordan would have to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.969 
time and then Jordan would have to
contribute<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> story<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.890> he

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
makes sense and in a short period of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.760 
makes sense and in a short period of
time<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.030> second<00:01:09.450> bruh

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
time so you have like one second bruh

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
time so you have like one second bruh
okay<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.700> he<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.970> move<00:01:12.090> forward<00:01:12.510> but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
okay then then he can move forward but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
okay then then he can move forward but
if<00:01:12.900> he<00:01:12.960> takes<00:01:13.170> too<00:01:13.320> long<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:14.130> unfortunately

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
if he takes too long then unfortunately

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.620 
if he takes too long then unfortunately
he<00:01:15.630> has<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> move<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.259> space<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
he has to move back a space so that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.700
