adventure<00:02:10.560> game<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:12.060> other<00:02:12.300> maybe<00:02:12.720> sometime

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
adventure game the other maybe sometime

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.370

a<00:02:13.440> party<00:02:14.010> game<00:02:14.220> who<00:02:14.580> knows<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.380> definitely

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
a party game who knows and definitely

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340 
a party game who knows and definitely
the<00:02:16.620> third<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.370> has<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.090> Sonic<00:02:18.540> 4<00:02:18.750> episode

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the third one has to be Sonic 4 episode

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.800 
the third one has to be Sonic 4 episode
2<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.830> mean<00:02:20.310> there's<00:02:20.460> no<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.210> can't<00:02:21.570> be

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
2 I mean there's no way it can't be

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.640 
2 I mean there's no way it can't be
unless<00:02:22.590> there's<00:02:22.860> something<00:02:23.340> super<00:02:23.850> secret

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
unless there's something super secret

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.900 
unless there's something super secret
something<00:02:25.650> else<00:02:25.860> super<00:02:26.160> secret<00:02:26.520> coming<00:02:26.790> out

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
something else super secret coming out

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
something else super secret coming out
so<00:02:27.120> Sega<00:02:27.420> will<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.780> announcing<00:02:28.380> something

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830

new installment of Sonic 4 so I think

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.590 
new installment of Sonic 4 so I think
that's<00:04:13.650> definitely<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.030> happen<00:04:15.420> this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
that's definitely going to happen this

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.920 
that's definitely going to happen this
time<00:04:15.660> round<00:04:16.140> also<00:04:16.919> better<00:04:17.910> physics<00:04:18.510> better

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
time round also better physics better

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.180

story<00:04:19.590> less<00:04:20.580> rehash<00:04:21.510> levels<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.740> look<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
story less rehash levels that look the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.970 
story less rehash levels that look the
same<00:04:23.460> as<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.060> originals

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
same as the originals

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.750 
same as the originals
and<00:04:26.570> more<00:04:27.570> originality<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.740> bosses<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.460> all

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
and more originality in bosses and all

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.190 
and more originality in bosses and all
that<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.360> think<00:04:30.570> we're<00:04:30.690> going<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.020> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
that and I think we're going to get that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.710 
that and I think we're going to get that
really<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.250> time<00:04:32.490> fully<00:04:32.880> realized<00:04:33.390> this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
really this time fully realized this

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.860 
really this time fully realized this
time<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:35.690> well<00:04:36.690> as<00:04:37.490> far<00:04:38.490> that's<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> 3ds<00:04:39.360> I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
time and well as far that's the 3ds I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.150 
time and well as far that's the 3ds I
really<00:04:40.560> do<00:04:40.860> think<00:04:42.200> something<00:04:43.200> is<00:04:43.440> going<00:04:43.860> to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
really do think something is going to

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.300 
really do think something is going to
come<00:04:44.520> out<00:04:46.190> with<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:48.120> 3ds<00:04:48.510> because<00:04:49.310> about

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
come out with the 3ds because about

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.510 
come out with the 3ds because about
Sonic<00:04:50.790> because<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:52.530> already<00:04:52.830> been<00:04:53.010> hinted

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
Sonic because it's already been hinted

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.320 
Sonic because it's already been hinted
that<00:04:53.790> they<00:04:54.750> will<00:04:54.990> be<00:04:55.520> making<00:04:56.520> something<00:04:57.000> for

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
that they will be making something for

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.630 
that they will be making something for
the<00:04:57.450> 3ds<00:04:57.810> which<00:04:58.590> will<00:04:58.770> probably<00:04:59.010> most<00:04:59.550> likely

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
the 3ds which will probably most likely

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.150 
the 3ds which will probably most likely
be<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.120> venture<00:05:00.600> game<00:05:00.810> which<00:05:01.050> will<00:05:01.230> be<00:05:01.380> so

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
be a venture game which will be so

think it's this June he turns 20 so

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.990 
think it's this June he turns 20 so
there'll<00:05:46.230> be<00:05:46.320> an<00:05:46.530> out<00:05:46.740> yet<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.430> course<00:05:47.730> he

turns to an he turned 19 last year but

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.190 
turns to an he turned 19 last year but
this<00:05:51.420> year<00:05:51.480> he'll<00:05:51.900> turn<00:05:52.250> 20<00:05:53.250> so<00:05:54.200> Sega

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
this year he'll turn 20 so Sega

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.750 
this year he'll turn 20 so Sega
definitely<00:05:55.710> has<00:05:55.830> something<00:05:56.160> planned<00:05:56.370> for<00:05:56.580> the
