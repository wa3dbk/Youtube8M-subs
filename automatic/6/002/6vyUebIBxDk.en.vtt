00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hi, I came here today to talk about a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.589
 A little gadget that won a lot of people. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.019
 the tablets 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.120
 despite the sales boom many still 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.940
 have doubts about how they can be 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.839
 used on a daily basis but leaves me or 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'll come 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.910
 are several options within the reach of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 Fingers all very fast and convenient if 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 look for fun this device was made 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.619
 for you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 so it's easy to watch videos in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.810
 anywhere either on the bus or subway 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.099
 the way of work attempted in bed or 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.079
 even in the car 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 many models can also be used 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 to watch even cool digital tv 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.340
 surfing the internet is also more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 on a larger screen that is sensitive to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 touch and you can access your account 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 facebook the instagram without complications 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.700
 already for those who like to read the tablets are 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 great you will have access to books 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 magazines and newspapers in a practical way the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.149
 screen size leaves the experience 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 much like reading the books 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.620
 with the advantage that you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 can increase the letter and change the color of the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.309
 screen as you prefer 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 It is still possible to highlight 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 text and use an integrated dictionary 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 to know the meaning of a word 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.900
 that you do not know much is not really 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 not stop there 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 they can still be used to take 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.439
 photos and make video calls or even 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.520
 such as GPS to help find the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.530
 best way 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 now you tell me it was listening to music 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.390
 you can save your favorites and listen 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 with headset or through the top 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.100
 speaker for those who like to discover 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.350
 new bands give even to use apps 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 which provide a multitude of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 options for you to do this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 also enjoy playing the thousands 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.960
 games specially created for this 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.729
 many of them can be 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 downloaded for free 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.020
 You can also use it for work. 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.720
 there are a lot of apps 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.060
 to perform various tasks such as reading 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.610
 and reply and emails edit photos and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 videos as well as exchange files with 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 devices if you need to type 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.510
 quite the touch screen is not ideal but 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.800
 you can buy a keyboard that 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.840
 help with this task 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.940
 tablets are like smartphones 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.670
 most models 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.070
 have screens ranging from 7 to 10 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.620
 inches are many options and 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.900
 different prices as they are thin and light 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.960
 can be taken anywhere 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.660
 inside the school bag in the bag and 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.750
 depending on the size even in the pocket of the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.850
 then put on another important point 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.830
 when choosing the best model is 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.930
 know if it has only wifi connection 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.300
 or you can also use the chip from a 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.550
 internet operator 3g 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.530
 in case of the chip do not forget that it is 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.720
 I need to hire a data plan for 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.820
 able to navigate anywhere 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.340
 I think it's now easier to understand 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.760
 how tablets can be used is not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.760
 same
