have are his and mine or have a lot of
still<00:00:35.030> pictures<00:00:35.059> on<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.800> process<00:00:37.429> with<00:00:37.579> some

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
still pictures on the process with some

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.509 
still pictures on the process with some
explanations<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.140> how<00:00:39.289> things<00:00:39.499> went<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:39.949> what

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
explanations of how things went and what

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:41.590 
explanations of how things went and what
I<00:00:40.550> did<00:00:40.789> to<00:00:40.909> make<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.210> work

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
I did to make it work

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.329 
I did to make it work
so<00:00:41.960> real<00:00:42.440> quick<00:00:42.649> it's<00:00:43.600> half-inch<00:00:44.600> plywood<00:00:45.339> one

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
so real quick it's half-inch plywood one

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.729 
so real quick it's half-inch plywood one
pieces<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.629> base<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:48.109> see<00:00:48.199> it<00:00:48.409> runs<00:00:48.620> the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
pieces to the base you see it runs the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.680 
pieces to the base you see it runs the
full<00:00:48.949> length<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.940> top<00:00:50.269> part<00:00:50.449> of<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.569> roll

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
full length on the top part of the roll

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.299 
full length on the top part of the roll
bar<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.699> all<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.030> way<00:00:53.120> across<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.019> back

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
bar and all the way across to the back

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.860 
bar and all the way across to the back
and<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.460> guys<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.760> know<00:00:55.819> it's<00:00:56.089> black<00:00:56.539> not<00:00:56.569> black

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
and I guys I know it's black not black

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.500 
and I guys I know it's black not black
in<00:00:57.140> here<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:58.039> plus<00:00:58.339> it's<00:00:58.489> shaded<00:00:59.059> so<00:00:59.269> pilot

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
in here it's a plus it's shaded so pilot

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.540 
in here it's a plus it's shaded so pilot
hard<00:00:59.659> to<00:00:59.719> see<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.469> that's<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.710> base<00:01:00.889> where

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
hard to see so that's the base where

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.119 
hard to see so that's the base where
everythings<00:01:01.850> originates<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:03.109> then<00:01:03.289> we<00:01:03.469> build

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
everythings originates and then we build

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.490 
everythings originates and then we build
the<00:01:04.280> filter<00:01:04.969> pod<00:01:05.149> off<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:08.259> so<00:01:09.259> there<00:01:09.409> are

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
the filter pod off of that so there are

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.219 
the filter pod off of that so there are
four<00:01:10.000> marine<00:01:11.000> grade<00:01:11.479> 6<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.930> 1/2<00:01:12.049> inch

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
four marine grade 6 and 1/2 inch

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.050 
four marine grade 6 and 1/2 inch
speakers<00:01:12.680> they're<00:01:13.250> nothing<00:01:13.549> special<00:01:13.700> just

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
speakers they're nothing special just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.359 
speakers they're nothing special just
boss<00:01:14.420> audio<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.590> they're<00:01:15.979> not

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
boss audio but they're not

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.580 
boss audio but they're not
I'm<00:01:16.789> not<00:01:17.000> powering<00:01:17.810> with<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.020> amp<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.380> just

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
I'm not powering with the amp is just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
I'm not powering with the amp is just
off<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.950> head<00:01:19.100> unit<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:20.570> it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
off the head unit here and so that's it

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.230 
off the head unit here and so that's it
does<00:01:21.079> plenty<00:01:21.619> for<00:01:21.770> them<00:01:22.039> more<00:01:23.000> than<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.180> can

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
does plenty for them more than I can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.649 
does plenty for them more than I can
handle

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
handle

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.649 
handle
realistically<00:01:24.430> waterproof<00:01:25.430> ducts<00:01:25.670> cover<00:01:25.939> and

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
realistically waterproof ducts cover and

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.770 
realistically waterproof ducts cover and
we<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.140> switch<00:01:27.409> here<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.570> first

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
we have one switch here for the first

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.779 
we have one switch here for the first
switch<00:01:29.960> turns<00:01:30.320> on<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.560> head<00:01:30.680> unit<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
switch turns on the head unit and the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.120 
switch turns on the head unit and the
second<00:01:32.119> switch<00:01:32.299> turns<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.109> these<00:01:33.320> LEDs<00:01:33.829> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
second switch turns on these LEDs and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.889 
second switch turns on these LEDs and
they're<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:34.460> for<00:01:34.700> ambient<00:01:35.270> lighting<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.869> a

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
they're just for ambient lighting in a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.859 
they're just for ambient lighting in a
night<00:01:36.560> time<00:01:36.770> or<00:01:36.799> not<00:01:37.070> for<00:01:37.189> show<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.329> kind

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
night time or not for show but it kind

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.060 
night time or not for show but it kind
of<00:01:38.899> gives<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.649> good<00:01:39.770> little<00:01:39.950> look<00:01:40.100> there<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.710> so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
of gives a good little look there and so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.679 
of gives a good little look there and so
I<00:01:46.100> chose<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:46.969> head<00:01:47.149> unit<00:01:47.359> because<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.539> was

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
I chose this head unit because it was

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.480 
I chose this head unit because it was
cheap<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:48.020> marine<00:01:48.289> grade<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.429> was

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
cheap is marine grade and I was

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490 
cheap is marine grade and I was

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
still hear it over the CB t wine and the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.250 
still hear it over the CB t wine and the
