00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
hi I'm Toby from the kilobits and I've

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900 
hi I'm Toby from the kilobits and I've
been<00:00:08.730> sent<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.059> X<00:00:09.330> MGP<00:00:10.070> 703<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.250> review<00:00:11.550> so

let's<00:00:12.599> take<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:13.049> inside<00:00:13.200> do<00:00:14.040> some

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
let's take a look inside do some

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.269 
let's take a look inside do some
benchmarking<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.269> holds<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
benchmarking and see how it holds up the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.310

purely<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.239> look<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
purely for the look of the thing it

backlit decal for the touchpad but

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
backlit decal for the touchpad but
that's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> pointless<00:00:38.550> addition<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.719> be

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that's a pointless addition that can be

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420 
that's a pointless addition that can be
turned<00:00:40.020> off<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.320> altered<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.280> adds

turned off or altered it will it adds
nothing<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.270> nice<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> option

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
nothing but it's nice to have the option

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.750 
nothing but it's nice to have the option
and<00:00:43.320> apparently<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> final<00:00:44.579> build

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and apparently on the final build

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.160 
and apparently on the final build
there'll<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> different<00:00:45.510> decal<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> the

there'll be a different decal to the
