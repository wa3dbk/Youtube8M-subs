00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 in that process some group of dismissed 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.730
 that took a while fighting the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.580
 you 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:16.340
 louis was none other than iron ping and 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.440
 well many times what they had 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 many times they stopped us many times 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.060
 they removed the money from the workplace 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.839
 and in this order there was a struggle with a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.839
 terrible police 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.120
 on March 12 , 65 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.440
 We held a demonstration organized by 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.440
 Communist Party and Workers Commissions 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 that's why I claim a street for 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 what you say March 12, 65 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.619
 and why do I say that because that day 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.460
 the underground unions and the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.270
 parties got 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.280
 get the fight out of the wells by mid to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.040
 half of it and was to make a 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.040
 demonstration and an assault on the police station 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 that's why I ask for a street for the 12th 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
 March nobody listens to me but good yo 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.490
 I keep asking what the meeting raises 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.329
 First 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 who of us was willing to 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.180
 Take this to one more action 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.110
 determinant 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 a radical action 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.810
 they were not a specialized body 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.600
 It was a catch here 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.820
 they were behind where they are where is the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 monument to everything that costs 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.909
 from behind they were quartered there 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.680
 back in a chamizo that there was to start 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.540
 from that date was when they started 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.350
 come here those already prepared with 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.880
 riot police with rolls but in 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
 that date are not ready for 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 nothing did not expect such a thing and they were 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.990
 he took totally unprepared and it was the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.400
 battle for the bad chair because if 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.280
 effectively, in a way 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 you have to call it was melee and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 it's the guards' caps pulled from 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.730
 harpoon lively and women pulling the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.560
 shoes to the policemen to the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.130
 crystals to the windows mother my 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.880
 amazing 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.980
 because the men of the policemen the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.879
 women's shoes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.129
 all through the air some sticks people 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.459
 bleeding with gaps in the head with 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.860
 the head open if I remember to fly 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.860
 shoes toward the window 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.080
 wherever it is the cops what yes 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.210
 remember they were effectively goals 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.870
 ruffles the edges of the porquet would do 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.730
 Cap 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.760
 they do not go around, the hat is that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.760
 taste 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.220
 I for the curator 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.120
 They fell in six months 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.799
 me and six other companions 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.850

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.280
 head of 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.340
 of the rebellion the case is that with them 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 how was it so incident 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.110

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.800
