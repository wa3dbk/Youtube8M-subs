00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.850
 published on July 21 production 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 the premieres of the factory running against time 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.880
 In Brazil, about 25 factories produce a little more than 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 since 2000 square meters of ceramic 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.460
 used handicapped relatives is the so-called ceramic coating 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 teresa coat 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.649
 around the 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.230
 was seen 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.800
 it consists of using 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.390
 the preparation of clay 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.150
 her good training 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.200
 the format 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.460
 has an enameling head outlet 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 created by action 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.820
 already on Tuesday 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.220
 the crowd is shaken but this production process starts well before this 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 in exchange 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.240
 this land he used to wet himself with ciro but I know what we usually call a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.820
 bar is the main raw material in the manufacture of ceramics 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.810
 the clay represents almost 90% of head leaving the factory is the ore 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.940
 found mainly on the coast the goals near rivers but not enough 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.020
 observe the material needs to have some specific characteristics to be 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.790
 used in industry 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 the current intercalation of limestone 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.150
 belong to the union 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.440
 This means that in order to extract clay the company must have 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.610
 national department of mineral production dnpm 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 in addition the extraction can cause damage to the environment 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.220
 so it is also necessary the authorization of environmental agencies 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.500
 well the first tied the game participated in the operation of tav no 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.170
 were to jump in the landscape some of these developments alter course 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 of small referees 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.970
 what is not allowed by environmental legislation 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.940
 but also in the speech that exists in the hour 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.299
 besides harming the environment the extraction and regularization of clay can 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.979
 take the company to the dock 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.699
 was what happened in the municipality of divine shepherdess to 26 kilometers of 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.139
 aracaju 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.459
 the ceramics sergipe that the license to explore this area 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
 could extract up to 12 thousand tons of clay 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.919
 material would be used in researches 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.299
 but the factory ended up taking two tons more than allowed 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.200
 How does she have this need for Sao Paulo? 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.860
 she was notified for having made a withdrawal which the court ruled 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.669
 that had been 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.680
 even more so than in fact she had the license at that moment to 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:03.859
 gestation 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.109
 the remaining clay went into the production line of the company 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.769
 that ended up denounced by the federal public ministry 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.769
 for the prosecution 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.449
 besides illegal the process caused damages to the nature 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.399
 the average sergipe ceramics 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.149
 I do not know, as far as I know. 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.159
 the accusation of environmental degradation 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.879
 see the notification has been made to extract it gal 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.880
 the case was judged by this federal judge 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.730
 as well as the public ministry he also understood that the attitude of the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.089
 company has jeopardized the balance of nature 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.669
 the main penalty 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.579
 I did not require the environmental licensing this being done 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.099
 illegal exploitation of the inevitable consequence of predation 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.509
 the order of justice was clear. 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.959
 the affected area must be recovered as soon as possible 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.019
 the process is slow but you can already see progress 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.929
 gradually the natural vegetation resumes its space 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.019
 and the green spreads amid the erosion caused by the action of man 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.910
 on the other side, the ceramic is only waiting for the license to be 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.340
 re-extract clay from the field while nature exists 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.390
 gradually the huge craters where today tons of clay were withdrawn 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.000
 became ideal places for the formation of lakes and the world 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.439
 in the case of a divine shepherdess these should serve as an alert 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.210
 remember industry that the manufacture of ceramics should start to be rotated 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.380
 respect for the law and the environment
