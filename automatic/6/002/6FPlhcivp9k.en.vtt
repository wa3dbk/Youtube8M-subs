00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.429 
say I don't have much work experience I
just<00:01:14.360> got<00:01:14.510> out<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.630> school<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.140> what's<00:01:15.320> your

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
just got out of school so what's your

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.140 
just got out of school so what's your
advice<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.650> them<00:01:15.920> well<00:01:16.520> colleges<00:01:17.030> are
