00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello all youtube friends i am your 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 friend is voted 100 today I'm going to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
 present a top 5 of the best games 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 of neo geo in my opinion and so you do not 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 like my video you can do yours 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.690
 First, neo-geo is a system of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 16 bits based on cartridges for arcade 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 as well as video consoles for the home 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 launched in 1990 by the company's 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 Japanese video games sn that currently 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 snk playmore but many of us knew their 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.210
 games for the little machines good without more 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 what to say we start at number 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 5 we have super seed x is a game of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.250
 football very entertaining for me is the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 best soccer game of the neo geo yet 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 I remember when me and my cousin were going to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 the little machines to play it had a good 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.559
 number of teams to choose and also 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.600
 championships the game was very simple and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.430
 quick you only had to score a goal in 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.710
 the other goal to win since the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 time was going too fast could you 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 put everything from faults to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.399
 Chileans without a doubt a game that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.609
 deserves to be remembered from the neo geo in the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 put number 4 we have softwares is a 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.380
 shooting game of the best of neo 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.869
 geo through all the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.420
 and we will go through many scenarios whether 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.369
 by a forest a canyon or by a river the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.619
 game is very long and has a great 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.960
 variety of weapons during missions 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.360
 we will pass through many parts whether lakes 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 swamps rivers of lava or by a train in 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 movement the bosses have a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.360
 difficulty well achieved the only thing that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.880
 bad encounter in the game is that the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.950
 bosses are repeated too many times if not 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.929
 you have played it and you like games 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 shooting you must play it is a very good 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.659
 game of the best of the neo geo in the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.399
 put number 3 we have spin master is 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.140
 a game in which we put ourselves in the 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.149
 role of a boy who has a girlfriend 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.069
 but as always there is going to be a villain 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.229
 that kidnaps her and our character the 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.880
 have to rescue us we will be 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.470
 armed with a yoyo 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.360
 but the yoyo can be modified and 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.030
 we can have more than 7 different weapons 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.250
 whether they are ice fire or a yoyo more 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.869
 big we will also have a power 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.909
 special which will help us a lot 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.530
 when there are more enemies than those 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.450
 we can defeat since the power 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.520
 destroy everything in its path there will be 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.799
 many types of bosses like snakes 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.019
 three-headed snakes or minions 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.030
 of the villain without a doubt one of the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.790
 games that more 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.980
 at number 2 we have the saga of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.990
 metal slug metal slug has been of the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 most remembered sagas and plays because 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.040
 almost all gamers know this game 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.440
 the game will put us in many 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.810
 situations and scenarios either in a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.000
 war in a zombie invasion has a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.740
 great variety of weapons one clearly is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.800
 stronger than others in missions 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.020
 there will be everything rockets subjefes tanks or 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.970
 also men of the snows as far as 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.950
 the bosses are very well designed 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.080
 to be very battled you because some 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.450
 they have a point at which to shoot them and 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520
 that makes it very difficult to kill them in some 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.920
 games of the saga we will have the option of 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.960
 choose between four characters without a doubt 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.730
 some one of the most remembered games 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.040
 and played in the history of the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.810
 videogames if you have not played it down 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.610
 a neo-geo emulator and play what 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.280
 because you do not really know what you 're serious about 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.100
 you're losing at number one 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.140
 we have the king of fighters is one of 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.030
 the most recognized fighting games of 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.250
 the story but in my opinion those of 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.080
 neo geo were the best in the saga the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.069
 first game of the saga was the king of 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.890
 fighters 94 in the year 1994 the console 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.079
 of this saga was the one that there is currently 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.239
 for many consoles either desktop 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.579
 or portable but obviously the best 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.499
 versions are for desktop the game 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.599
 has many characters to choose from 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.879
 talking about the whole saga each with 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.769
 his powers and abilities different to 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.439
 me the characters that I liked the most 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.750
 choosing was robert your and without any doubt 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.730
 one of the fighting games that do put 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.409
 a little more effort the creators 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.450
 can be up to street 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.370
 fighter undoubtedly one of the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.409
 fighting games that marked and will be 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.689
 remembered in the history of video games 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.790
 like the best fighters thanks to the 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.280
 technology now we can play these 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.109
 games without any worry the game 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.939
 currently it is in almost 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.099
 any recreational console too 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.750
 known as little machines without a doubt 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.750
 some the best games of the neo geo 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.170
 good friends this was my top 5 of the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.480
 best neo geo games one of the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.250
