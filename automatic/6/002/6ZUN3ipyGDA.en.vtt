00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
far down the road at the moment we need

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.580

to try and catch him he's Australian and
that<00:02:06.979> means<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.430> he's<00:02:08.030> gonna<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.269> similar<00:02:08.630> to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
that's gonna be leaving it a little bit

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.830 
that's gonna be leaving it a little bit
too<00:02:30.650> late<00:02:30.920> as<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:32.030> someone<00:02:32.510> can't

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
why did I even get excited codemasters

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.050 
why did I even get excited codemasters
why<00:02:54.080> we're<00:02:54.709> back<00:02:54.920> into<00:02:55.220> second<00:02:55.580> because<00:02:55.700> final

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
why we're back into second because final

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.449 
why we're back into second because final
chicane<00:02:56.180> has<00:02:56.570> teleported<00:02:57.170> himself<00:02:57.500> back<00:02:57.920> into

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
chicane has teleported himself back into

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.610 
chicane has teleported himself back into
first<00:02:58.970> position<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.750> is<00:03:00.050> going<00:03:00.319> around<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
first position and is going around the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.170 
first position and is going around the
hairpin<00:03:00.980> now<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.370> looks<00:03:01.459> like<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.760> struggle<00:03:02.150> a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
hairpin now it looks like you struggle a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.850 
hairpin now it looks like you struggle a
bit<00:03:02.209> we<00:03:02.690> have<00:03:02.930> cut<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.260> corner<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.680> an

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
bit we have cut the corner like an

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.979 
bit we have cut the corner like an
absolute<00:03:04.130> Jeb<00:03:04.730> end<00:03:04.910> because<00:03:05.300> we<00:03:05.420> saw<00:03:05.660> someone

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
absolute Jeb end because we saw someone

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.830 
absolute Jeb end because we saw someone
behind<00:03:06.170> us<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.250> arrow<00:03:07.519> flew<00:03:08.030> past<00:03:08.300> us<00:03:08.630> so

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
behind us and the arrow flew past us so

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.259 
behind us and the arrow flew past us so
maybe<00:03:09.050> maybe<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.370> saved<00:03:10.640> our<00:03:10.820> rear<00:03:11.060> ends

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
maybe maybe we just saved our rear ends

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.720 
maybe maybe we just saved our rear ends
from<00:03:11.480> an<00:03:11.600> absolute<00:03:12.050> demolishing<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.489> we<00:03:13.580> are

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
from an absolute demolishing but we are

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.100 
from an absolute demolishing but we are
now<00:03:13.850> still<00:03:14.150> trying<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.510> catch<00:03:14.630> final<00:03:14.870> chicane

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
now still trying to catch final chicane

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.170 
now still trying to catch final chicane
looks<00:03:15.500> very<00:03:15.769> very<00:03:15.890> close<00:03:16.340> as<00:03:16.489> we<00:03:16.610> come<00:03:16.790> towards

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
looks very very close as we come towards

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.060 
looks very very close as we come towards
the<00:03:17.300> final<00:03:17.630> chicane<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.470> second<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.920> last

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
the final chicane for the second to last

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.710 
the final chicane for the second to last
time<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.730> are<00:03:19.760> catching<00:03:20.120> him<00:03:20.360> very

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
time and we are catching him very

time and we are catching him very
quickly<00:03:20.959> indeed<00:03:21.350> he<00:03:21.709> seems<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.280> struggle

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
quickly indeed he seems to struggle

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.150 
quickly indeed he seems to struggle
slightly<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.630> both<00:03:23.840> traction<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.560> having

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
slightly with both traction and having

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.470 
slightly with both traction and having
quite<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.459> bit<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.730> lag<00:03:25.910> by<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.180> looks<00:03:26.390> of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
quite a bit of lag by the looks of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.850 
quite a bit of lag by the looks of
things<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.810> we're<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.260> slipstream<00:03:27.560> now

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860
