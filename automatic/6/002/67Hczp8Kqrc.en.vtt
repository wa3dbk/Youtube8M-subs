asking how I make jazz sounds without
you<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.429> lot<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.420> extensive<00:00:16.260> practice<00:00:16.500> or

you know a lot of extensive practice or

you know a lot of extensive practice or
a<00:00:17.810> lot<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.930> work<00:00:19.050> involved<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.699> easy

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
a lot of work involved one really easy

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
a lot of work involved one really easy
technique<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.050> could<00:00:22.199> use<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.949> simple

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
technique that you could use is a simple

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.460 
technique that you could use is a simple
chord<00:00:23.990> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> shape<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.480> say<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.840> E

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
chord if you know the shape of say an E

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
chord if you know the shape of say an E
chord<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.960> good<00:00:31.140> cord<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:32.279> also

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
chord a really good cord that also

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.970 
chord a really good cord that also
sounds<00:00:33.059> really<00:00:33.480> goo<00:00:33.660> would<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.770> ad<00:00:35.399> chord<00:00:36.980> but

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
sounds really goo would be ad chord but

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.959 
sounds really goo would be ad chord but
it<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> d7<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.260> shape<00:00:40.890> d<00:00:41.309> 7<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it would be a d7 this the shape d 7 is

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
it would be a d7 this the shape d 7 is
like<00:00:45.710> but<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> wouldn't<00:00:47.070> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
like but you wouldn't want to do a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
like but you wouldn't want to do a
decent<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.539> fact<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> pattern

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
decent in fact if you use that pattern

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
decent in fact if you use that pattern
but<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> different<00:00:50.789> position<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but in a different position say in the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
but in a different position say in the
lower<00:00:51.840> strings<00:00:52.230> such<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.149> right

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lower strings such as the three right

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.160 
lower strings such as the three right
here<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.550> use<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.000> hybrid<00:01:00.660> picking<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
here and then use a hybrid picking now I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.310 
here and then use a hybrid picking now I
don't<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.920> standard<00:01:02.430> pic<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.059> use<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.049> thumb

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
don't use a standard pic I use my thumb

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.429 
don't use a standard pic I use my thumb
for<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> top<00:01:05.339> string<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.180> my

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
for the top string and then I use my

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.520 
for the top string and then I use my
fingers<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.110> longer<00:01:10.110> nails<00:01:10.260> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
fingers now I have longer nails for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.370 
fingers now I have longer nails for
playing<00:01:10.740> classical<00:01:11.280> music<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:13.080> has

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
playing classical music so that also has

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
playing classical music so that also has
to<00:01:13.830> give<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> pic<00:01:14.340> sound

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
to give the pic sound

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.830 
to give the pic sound
a<00:01:15.450> rather<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> sharp<00:01:21.570> twing

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a rather than you get the sharp twing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.210 
a rather than you get the sharp twing
you<00:01:21.990> salary<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:23.729> playing<00:01:24.180> dumb<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.220> finger

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you salary so by playing dumb and finger

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.950 
you salary so by playing dumb and finger
and<00:01:26.369> ring<00:01:26.549> finger<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:27.240> four<00:01:27.479> finger<00:01:27.780> rather

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.160 

and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.649> using<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.039> d7<00:01:32.580> shape<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> we'll<00:01:33.990> be

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and then using a d7 shape and we'll be

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
and then using a d7 shape and we'll be
using<00:01:35.600> 323<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:39.439> main<00:01:40.439> existence<00:01:41.299> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
using 323 on the main existence that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.559 
using 323 on the main existence that
would<00:01:42.570> look<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.940> then<00:01:50.940> taking

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
would look like this and then taking

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.510 
would look like this and then taking
like<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.289> get<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.830> jazzy<00:01:56.100> sound

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like this now to get the jazzy sound

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.809 
like this now to get the jazzy sound
that<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.789> use<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.569> a<00:01:57.920> little<00:01:58.920> vibrato<00:01:59.340> which

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
that I use I do a little vibrato which

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.770 
that I use I do a little vibrato which
is<00:01:59.970> like<00:02:03.830> now<00:02:04.830> obviously<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.030> lot<00:02:06.209> of<00:02:06.539> jazz

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
is like now obviously a lot of jazz

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
is like now obviously a lot of jazz
you'll<00:02:06.990> hear<00:02:07.170> has<00:02:07.319> slides<00:02:07.709> hammer-ons<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you'll hear has slides hammer-ons and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.430 
you'll hear has slides hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:02:09.500> i'll<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.679> using<00:02:10.890> mainly<00:02:12.230> pull<00:02:13.230> offs

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pull-offs i'll be using mainly pull offs

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.890 
pull-offs i'll be using mainly pull offs
and<00:02:13.769> slides<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:14.940> words<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and slides a little words like that I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.500 
and slides a little words like that I
also<00:02:19.530> use<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> couple<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.489> hammer<00:02:20.700> ons<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.390> if

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
also use a couple of hammer ons so if

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.840 
also use a couple of hammer ons so if
you<00:02:21.600> want<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> quick<00:02:22.769> practice<00:02:23.250> technique<00:02:23.640> for

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
you want a quick practice technique for

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.210 
you want a quick practice technique for
an<00:02:23.940> example<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.690> wanted<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.100> would

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
an example and you wanted one that would

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:36.620 
an example and you wanted one that would
start<00:02:26.489> like<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:34.340> again<00:02:35.340> using<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> d7

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
start like this again using just the d7

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
start like this again using just the d7
shape

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.050 

and<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.319> slide<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.799> put<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> robot<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:44.849> on

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and if you slide and put a robot or on

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.900 
and if you slide and put a robot or on
it<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.299> sounds<00:02:45.599> really<00:02:45.719> good
