and we have four answers you may choose
any<00:00:07.849> of<00:00:08.849> these<00:00:09.179> answers<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.110> then<00:00:11.099> compare

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
any of these answers and then compare

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.629 
any of these answers and then compare
with<00:00:11.849> my<00:00:12.469> explanation<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.830> may<00:00:14.009> stop<00:00:14.309> reader

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
with my explanation you may stop reader

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.120 
with my explanation you may stop reader
here<00:00:15.059> choose<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.199> oh<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.949> then

here choose on your oh one and then

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.040 
here choose on your oh one and then
compare<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:19.980> explanation<00:00:21.050> let's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
compare so here is my explanation let's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.340 
compare so here is my explanation let's
start<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.010> answer<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> word

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
start from the answer a and as a word

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.609 
start from the answer a and as a word
for<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.710> gene<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:27.300> would<00:00:27.599> say<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
for a gene and I would say that this is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.730 
for a gene and I would say that this is
close<00:00:29.029> let's<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> other<00:00:30.990> question

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
close let's see at the other question

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.940 
close let's see at the other question
other<00:00:32.279> answers<00:00:33.710> homozygous<00:00:34.710> genotype<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
other answers homozygous genotype and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.610 
other answers homozygous genotype and
answer<00:00:37.950> C<00:00:38.190> heterozygous<00:00:39.090> genotype<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.719> let<00:00:40.379> me

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
answer C heterozygous genotype so let me

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
answer C heterozygous genotype so let me
explain<00:00:41.090> these<00:00:42.090> two<00:00:42.450> answers<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.739> does<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
explain these two answers what does it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.490 
explain these two answers what does it
mean<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.719> example<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.760> one<00:00:47.760> plant

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
mean for example we have one plant

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.400 
mean for example we have one plant
dominant<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.920> some<00:00:50.399> trait<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.940> example<00:00:51.480> for

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
dominant for some trait for example for

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.660 
dominant for some trait for example for
the<00:00:52.850> color<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.420> plant<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.829> red

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the color of the plant that will be red

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.930 
the color of the plant that will be red
color<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.379> another<00:00:58.379> plant<00:00:58.969> would<00:00:59.969> be

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
color and another plant would be

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.530 
color and another plant would be
homozygous<00:01:03.140> recessive<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.360> also<00:01:06.360> for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
homozygous recessive for the also for

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
homozygous recessive for the also for
this<00:01:07.580> trait<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> color<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.220> going

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this trait for the color but it's going

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.609 
this trait for the color but it's going
to<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.880> white<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> recessive<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
to be white so this is recessive and

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.950 
to be white so this is recessive and
this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> dominant<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:19.700> if<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.540> cross<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this is dominant and if we cross this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.929 
this is dominant and if we cross this
two<00:01:22.590> plants<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.710> progeny<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
two plants we will get progeny so we can

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.530 
two plants we will get progeny so we can
call<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.570> plant<00:01:29.150> parent<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:33.210> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
call this plant parent one and this one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.230 
call this plant parent one and this one
parent<00:01:34.079> too<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:36.350> progeny<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.890> f1

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
parent too and the progeny would be f1

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.810 
parent too and the progeny would be f1
generation<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:44.040> parent

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
generation so we would have this parent

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.530 
generation so we would have this parent
would<00:01:45.380> provide<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.939> dominant<00:01:49.430> gene<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
would provide one dominant gene for this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
would provide one dominant gene for this
trait<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.820> another<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.270> provide<00:01:55.490> one

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
trait and another one provide one

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
trait and another one provide one
recessive<00:01:57.770> gene<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> street<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.200> we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
recessive gene for the street and we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.119 
recessive gene for the street and we
will<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:05.210> heterozygous<00:02:06.409> plant<00:02:07.409> that's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
will have here heterozygous plant that's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.260 
will have here heterozygous plant that's
going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:09.000> be

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.710 

same<00:02:11.570> phenotype<00:02:13.300> phenotypically<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.480> same

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
same phenotype phenotypically the same

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:24.760 
same phenotype phenotypically the same
like<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:16.010> parent<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:22.510> dominant<00:02:23.770> because

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
like a parent that is dominant because

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.990 
like a parent that is dominant because
it<00:02:25.130> has<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.760> dominant<00:02:26.650> gene<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.000> another

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
it has one dominant gene and another

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.950 
it has one dominant gene and another
gene<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:30.940> recessive<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.320> call<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.740> a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
gene is recessive so we call it a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.230 
gene is recessive so we call it a
phenotype<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.880> have<00:02:38.260> two<00:02:39.260> different

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
phenotype we have two different

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.390 
phenotype we have two different
genotypes<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.890> same<00:02:43.130> phenotype<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:45.400> we

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
genotypes but the same phenotype and we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.580 
genotypes but the same phenotype and we
also<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:48.280> one<00:02:49.280> genotype<00:02:50.230> recessive<00:02:51.230> here

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
also have one genotype recessive here

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.710 
also have one genotype recessive here
one<00:02:52.130> dominant<00:02:52.820> here<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:54.320> heterozygous

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
one dominant here and one heterozygous

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.050 
one dominant here and one heterozygous
so<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:58.840> homozygous<00:02:59.840> recessive<00:03:00.650> dominant

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.020 

homozygous<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.350> heterozygous<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.610> we<00:03:07.790> can

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
homozygous and heterozygous so we can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.370 
homozygous and heterozygous so we can
also<00:03:08.810> cross<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:11.030> two<00:03:11.810> answers<00:03:12.520> because

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
also cross out this two answers because

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.490 
also cross out this two answers because
this<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.560> not<00:03:15.770> correct<00:03:16.010> answers<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.500> correct

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is not correct answers and correct

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.970 
this is not correct answers and correct
answer<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.160> d<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> several<00:03:21.320> possible

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
answer is d one of the several possible

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.790 
answer is d one of the several possible
forms<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.910> gene<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.110> also<00:03:24.350> cross

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
forms of the gene so we can also cross

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.199 
forms of the gene so we can also cross
out<00:03:25.070> answer<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:27.110> we<00:03:27.740> see<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:29.240> gene<00:03:29.920> have<00:03:31.209> two

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
out answer a so we see one gene have two

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.960 
out answer a so we see one gene have two
different<00:03:32.450> forms<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:34.070> it's<00:03:34.310> recessive

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
different forms like here it's recessive

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.670 
different forms like here it's recessive
and<00:03:36.700> this<00:03:37.700> gene<00:03:38.030> codes<00:03:38.330> for<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.780> white<00:03:39.260> color

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and this gene codes for the white color

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.420 
and this gene codes for the white color
and<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.790> same<00:03:41.030> gene<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.690> another<00:03:42.430> plant

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
and the same gene in another plant

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.270 
and the same gene in another plant
another<00:03:43.820> parent<00:03:44.360> code<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.709> different

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
another parent code for the different

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.860 
another parent code for the different
color<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.720> dominant<00:03:48.550> but<00:03:49.550> it's<00:03:50.480> not

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
color that is dominant but it's not

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.400 
color that is dominant but it's not
about<00:03:51.250> dominance<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.550> recessive<00:03:53.090> knees<00:03:53.480> it's

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
about dominance and recessive knees it's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.400 
about dominance and recessive knees it's
also<00:03:54.709> could<00:03:55.100> could<00:03:55.550> be<00:03:55.840> codominant<00:03:56.840> for

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
also could could be codominant for

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.040 
also could could be codominant for
example<00:03:57.890> in<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:59.390> case<00:03:59.990> we<00:04:00.260> would<00:04:00.410> have<00:04:00.470> a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
example in this case we would have a

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.740 
example in this case we would have a
plant<00:04:03.050> for<00:04:03.290> example<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:04.040> would<00:04:04.250> be

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
plant for example that would be

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.060 
plant for example that would be
phenotypically<00:04:05.750> different<00:04:06.380> from<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.860> both

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
phenotypically different from the both

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.040 
phenotypically different from the both
parents<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:08.920> for<00:04:09.920> example<00:04:10.459> this<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.270> red

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
parents like for example this is red

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.400 
parents like for example this is red
color<00:04:13.209> plant<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.510> this<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.870> white<00:04:15.140> color

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
color plant and this is white color

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.870 
color plant and this is white color
plant<00:04:15.830> they<00:04:16.100> may<00:04:16.280> produce<00:04:17.680> say<00:04:18.680> pink<00:04:19.130> plant<00:04:19.549> if

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
plant they may produce say pink plant if

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.820 
plant they may produce say pink plant if
it<00:04:20.810> would<00:04:21.169> be<00:04:21.350> quad<00:04:21.710> dominant

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
it would be quad dominant

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.129 
it would be quad dominant
so<00:04:23.039> there<00:04:23.940> could<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.440> many<00:04:25.440> different

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
so there could be many different

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.920 
so there could be many different
possible<00:04:28.139> forms<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.889> the<00:04:29.159> gene<00:04:29.460> not<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.659> two

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
possible forms of the gene not just two

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.279 
possible forms of the gene not just two
dominant<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.430> recessive<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:33.419> many<00:04:33.990> other

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
dominant and recessive but many other

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.210 
dominant and recessive but many other
forms<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.990> some<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.930> forms<00:04:39.930> can<00:04:40.259> be<00:04:40.470> say

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
forms and some of the forms can be say

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.899 
forms and some of the forms can be say
for<00:04:41.490> example<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.860> can<00:04:43.860> be<00:04:44.069> dominant<00:04:44.639> over<00:04:45.590> say<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
for example a can be dominant over say a

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.640 
for example a can be dominant over say a
1<00:04:47.909> but<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.780> 1<00:04:49.199> can<00:04:49.949> be<00:04:49.979> dominant<00:04:50.759> over<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:52.050> 2

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
1 but a 1 can be dominant over the a 2

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:01.240 
1 but a 1 can be dominant over the a 2
and<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:54.479> 2<00:04:54.590> can<00:04:55.590> be<00:04:55.620> dominant<00:04:56.129> over<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.969> a<00:04:57.300> 3<00:04:58.069> so

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.010 

there<00:05:02.250> are<00:05:02.370> many<00:05:02.909> different<00:05:03.210> possibilities

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
there are many different possibilities

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.950 
there are many different possibilities
and<00:05:04.789> two<00:05:05.789> alleles<00:05:06.599> usually<00:05:07.379> use<00:05:08.099> it<00:05:08.310> in

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
and two alleles usually use it in

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.430 
and two alleles usually use it in
different<00:05:09.960> examples<00:05:10.889> but<00:05:11.819> as<00:05:12.270> I'll<00:05:12.690> show<00:05:12.719> here

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
different examples but as I'll show here

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.619 
different examples but as I'll show here
it<00:05:14.099> can<00:05:14.490> be<00:05:14.729> 2<00:05:15.330> 3<00:05:15.810> 4<00:05:16.259> and<00:05:16.620> many<00:05:16.979> many<00:05:17.219> other

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
it can be 2 3 4 and many many other

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.520 
it can be 2 3 4 and many many other
different<00:05:18.629> forms<00:05:18.719> and<00:05:19.729> usually<00:05:20.729> a<00:05:21.419> lady<00:05:22.259> that

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
different forms and usually a lady that

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.140 
different forms and usually a lady that
is<00:05:22.740> present<00:05:23.370> in<00:05:23.729> this<00:05:24.060> then<00:05:24.719> 1<00:05:25.590> percent<00:05:26.190> is

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
is present in this then 1 percent is

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.909 
is present in this then 1 percent is
called<00:05:29.120> mutant<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.360> all<00:05:33.169> allele<00:05:34.169> is<00:05:34.319> that<00:05:34.740> is

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
called mutant and all allele is that is

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.670 
called mutant and all allele is that is
present<00:05:35.810> in<00:05:36.810> more<00:05:37.169> than<00:05:37.229> one<00:05:37.650> percent<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.599> just

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
present in more than one percent is just

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.059 
present in more than one percent is just
different<00:05:40.699> forms<00:05:41.699> of<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.240> gene<00:05:42.539> but<00:05:43.259> all<00:05:43.800> of

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
different forms of the gene but all of

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:50.330 
different forms of the gene but all of
them<00:05:45.169> considered<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.469> be<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:48.020> wild-type<00:05:49.340> not

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
them considered to be a wild-type not

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.890 
them considered to be a wild-type not
mutant<00:05:51.080> though<00:05:52.080> some<00:05:52.529> of<00:05:52.680> them<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.279> be
