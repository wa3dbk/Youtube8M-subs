David so now we're other than these

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
David so now we're other than these
failures<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.950> cause<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.189> pump

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
failures here what would cause this pump

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.499 
failures here what would cause this pump
to<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.880> work<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:16.280> our<00:01:17.280> clearances<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:18.330> much

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to not work on our clearances too much

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.190 
to not work on our clearances too much
clearance<00:01:18.780> okay<00:01:19.700> where's<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.020> too

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
clearance okay where's that we have too

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
clearance okay where's that we have too
much<00:01:22.350> clearance<00:01:22.860> between<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.880> called<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
much clearance between what we called a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.569 
much clearance between what we called a
vein<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> vein<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:27.180> housing<00:01:27.689> it's

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
vein this is a vein and the housing it's

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
vein this is a vein and the housing it's
could<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> darn<00:01:29.850> close<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> quarter<00:01:30.750> inch

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
could you darn close to a quarter inch

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.420 
could you darn close to a quarter inch
and<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.450> excessive<00:01:33.750> huh<00:01:34.110> yeah<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and a little excessive huh yeah it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.800 
and a little excessive huh yeah it
should<00:01:35.640> only<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.240> 20<00:01:36.659> thousands<00:01:37.170> okay

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
should only be about 20 thousands okay

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.460 
should only be about 20 thousands okay
and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.110> over<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.619> say<00:01:40.799> Oh<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:42.470> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and then over here you say Oh what on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.690 
and then over here you say Oh what on
the<00:01:43.619> edge<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.009> oh<00:01:44.189> yeah

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the edge here oh yeah

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450 
the edge here oh yeah
we<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.240> too<00:01:45.479> much<00:01:45.630> clearance<00:01:46.259> between<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
we have too much clearance between the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.380 
we have too much clearance between the
OD<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> housing<00:01:49.909> what<00:01:50.909> does<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
OD and the housing what does that one

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
OD and the housing what does that one
and<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:51.869> should<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> mean<00:01:52.399> climby<00:01:53.399> what

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and what should that mean climby what

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
and what should that mean climby what
how<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.240> how<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.479> clearance<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> down

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
how what how much clearance you down

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
how what how much clearance you down
there<00:01:55.290> yeah<00:01:56.719> about<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.869> hundred<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.610> should

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
there yeah about a hundred and it should

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
there yeah about a hundred and it should
be<00:01:59.909> no<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.719> about<00:02:00.810> 30<00:02:01.909> okay<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
be no more than about 30 okay so it can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
be no more than about 30 okay so it can
direct<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.000> instead<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.439> spitting<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.710> water

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
direct so instead of spitting the water

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520 
direct so instead of spitting the water
out<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.520> hole<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.239> spins<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> water<00:02:10.319> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
out on a hole it spins the water in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.880 
out on a hole it spins the water in
between<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.310> returns<00:02:11.700> again

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
between and returns again

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.780 
between and returns again
so<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> gonna<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.730> thing

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so what are you gonna do to this thing

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
so what are you gonna do to this thing
and<00:02:15.270> try<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> get<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:15.930> back<00:02:15.990> we're<00:02:16.410> supposed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
and try to get this back we're supposed

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.340 
and try to get this back we're supposed
to<00:02:16.710> be<00:02:18.260> build<00:02:19.260> everything<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.860> machine<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
to be build everything up machine it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
to be build everything up machine it
like<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.530> your<00:02:22.680> impeller<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
like on your impeller here so I can a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.840 
like on your impeller here so I can a
especially<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> Intel<00:02:25.890> I'll<00:02:26.070> see<00:02:26.820> all

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
especially on the Intel I'll see all

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.740 
especially on the Intel I'll see all
these<00:02:27.240> boogers<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.250> vein<00:02:29.850> needs<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.600> be

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
these boogers like this vein needs to be

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140 
these boogers like this vein needs to be
heated<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.620> straightened<00:02:32.070> up<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.490> weld<00:02:32.970> on

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
heated up and straightened up a weld on

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.470 
heated up and straightened up a weld on
all<00:02:34.130> two<00:02:35.130> four<00:02:35.400> six<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.940> them<00:02:36.090> has<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> be

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
all two four six of them has to be

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.930 
all two four six of them has to be
welded<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> larger<00:02:38.160> OD<00:02:38.520> REE

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
welded up so we have a larger OD REE

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600 
welded up so we have a larger OD REE
machine<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.770> you're<00:02:40.770> gonna<00:02:40.860> add<00:02:41.100> material<00:02:41.520> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
machine it you're gonna add material to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
machine it you're gonna add material to
the<00:02:41.730> outside<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.240> game<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the outside of the game and then on the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.070 
the outside of the game and then on the
bottom<00:02:43.560> -<00:02:43.830> yes<00:02:44.490> all<00:02:45.270> right<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:49.050> that

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
bottom - yes all right and then so that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.620 
bottom - yes all right and then so that
we<00:02:49.320> end<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> proper<00:02:50.790> clearance<00:02:51.000> now

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
we end up with the proper clearance now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.780 
we end up with the proper clearance now
this<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.050> particular<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.709> pretty<00:02:53.550> met

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this one in particular is get pretty met

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.370 
this one in particular is get pretty met
can<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.239> shaft<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.690> there

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:09.670 

that's<00:02:58.380> about<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.680> far<00:02:58.800> as<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.010> goes

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.600

Blythe's<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.489> clean<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.970> up<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.100> see<00:03:26.100> what<00:03:26.340> is

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
Blythe's to clean it up and see what is

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.009 
Blythe's to clean it up and see what is
leftover<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.209> why<00:03:27.780> they<00:03:28.260> use<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.739> much<00:03:28.950> JB

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
leftover and why they use that much JB

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.990 
leftover and why they use that much JB
more<00:03:31.019> than<00:03:31.170> likely<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.739> housing<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.430> corrode

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
more than likely the housing is corrode

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.560 
more than likely the housing is corrode
or<00:03:33.030> through<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:34.880> actually<00:03:35.880> all<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.209> has<00:03:36.390> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
or through and actually all that has to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.600 
or through and actually all that has to
be<00:03:36.690> corrected<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.860> won't<00:03:38.160> know<00:03:38.310> how<00:03:38.340> much

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
be corrected so you won't know how much

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.150 
be corrected so you won't know how much
to<00:03:38.820> build<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> impeller<00:03:39.600> correct<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.830> how

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
to build up the impeller correct or how

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.380 
to build up the impeller correct or how
to<00:03:41.220> make<00:03:41.430> what<00:03:41.610> angle<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.940> machine<00:03:42.239> or

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
to make what angle to machine or

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.580 
to make what angle to machine or
anything<00:03:42.600> until<00:03:42.900> you've<00:03:43.140> got<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.440> house

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
anything until you've got the house

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.009 
anything until you've got the house
while<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.860> angle<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.340> easy<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:45.570> simple

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
while the angle is easy that's simple

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.020 
while the angle is easy that's simple
but<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> has<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.500> match<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.650> housing<00:03:47.070> right

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
but it has to match the housing right

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.430 
but it has to match the housing right
but<00:03:48.209> your<00:03:48.360> machine<00:03:48.480> know<00:03:48.720> how<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> same

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
but your machine know how to do the same

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.310 
but your machine know how to do the same
angle<00:03:51.079> yeah<00:03:52.079> once<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.799> know<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.370> angle<00:03:54.320> you

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
angle yeah once you know the angle you

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.940 
angle yeah once you know the angle you
machine<00:03:55.890> either<00:03:56.190> one<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.489> them<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:58.739> will

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
machine either one of them and it will

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.520 
machine either one of them and it will
match<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.730> other<00:03:59.760> oh<00:04:00.290> boy<00:04:01.290> look<00:04:01.470> at

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
match it to the other oh boy look at

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.979 
match it to the other oh boy look at
that<00:04:01.590> thing<00:04:02.090> yeah<00:04:03.090> they<00:04:03.269> did<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> little<00:04:03.690> more

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
that thing yeah they did a little more

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.110 
that thing yeah they did a little more
on<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.400> those<00:04:05.400> are<00:04:05.549> supposed<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.850> straight

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
on it those are supposed to be straight

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.440 
on it those are supposed to be straight
right<00:04:06.709> vertical<00:04:07.709> no<00:04:08.640> they<00:04:08.880> have<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> slight

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
right vertical no they have a slight

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.050 
right vertical no they have a slight
curve<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.110> them<00:04:10.760> except<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.910> ones

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
curve two of them except for the ones

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.000 
curve two of them except for the ones
that<00:04:12.090> have<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.299> lot<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.510> curved<00:04:12.750> tongue<00:04:13.010> why

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
that have a lot of curved tongue why

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.340 
that have a lot of curved tongue why
yeah<00:04:14.310> because<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.910> got<00:04:15.000> bent<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.570> one<00:04:15.750> here

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.810 

but<00:04:19.350> otherwise<00:04:19.650> they<00:04:19.950> all<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.370> slight

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
but otherwise they all have a slight

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.170 
but otherwise they all have a slight
curve<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.180> them

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
curve to them

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.400 
curve to them
okay<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.480> you're<00:04:24.600> gonna<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:24.960> what<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.200> do

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
okay so then you're gonna do what you do

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.560 
okay so then you're gonna do what you do
and<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.990> about<00:04:28.920> two<00:04:29.310> seconds<00:04:29.670> here<00:04:29.850> won't<00:04:30.390> take

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
and in about two seconds here won't take

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.990 
and in about two seconds here won't take
a<00:04:30.600> look<00:04:30.810> at<00:04:30.900> what<00:04:31.050> you've<00:04:31.170> done

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
a look at what you've done

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.880 
a look at what you've done
here<00:04:33.000> Arthur<00:04:33.300> 1929<00:04:34.110> my<00:04:34.230> France<00:04:34.410> firetruck

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
here Arthur 1929 my France firetruck

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.370 
here Arthur 1929 my France firetruck
water<00:04:35.100> pump<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:36.840> what<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> inside

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
water pump and this is what the inside

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.080 
water pump and this is what the inside
looks<00:04:37.410> now<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.070> here's<00:04:38.640> what<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.910> looked<00:04:39.030> like

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
looks now and here's what it looked like

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.840 
looks now and here's what it looked like
before<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.780> how'd<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.800> come<00:04:41.190> about<00:04:41.340> getting

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
aluminum machine both sites put it in

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.860 
aluminum machine both sites put it in
welded<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.170> back<00:04:52.350> up<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.880> now<00:04:53.880> have<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.450> set<00:04:54.720> of

welded it back up and now have a set of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.420 
welded it back up and now have a set of
cast<00:04:55.350> aluminum<00:04:55.590> we<00:04:56.130> have<00:04:56.460> billet<00:04:56.910> aluminum

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
cast aluminum we have billet aluminum

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.460 
cast aluminum we have billet aluminum
okay<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.550> that's<00:04:59.640> machine<00:05:00.090> for<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.750> angle<00:05:01.380> of

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
okay and that's machine for the angle of

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.500 
okay and that's machine for the angle of
the<00:05:01.560> veins<00:05:01.800> yeah<00:05:02.310> angle<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.940> veins<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.390> the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
the veins yeah angle of the veins of the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.850 
the veins yeah angle of the veins of the
impeller<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.020> in<00:05:04.170> the<00:05:04.230> beginning<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:04.710> had

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
impeller and in the beginning we had

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.860 
impeller and in the beginning we had
that<00:05:05.010> clearance<00:05:05.370> issue<00:05:05.550> too<00:05:06.390> much<00:05:06.540> clearance

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
that clearance issue too much clearance

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.510 
that clearance issue too much clearance
like<00:05:07.260> my<00:05:07.380> water<00:05:07.590> age<00:05:07.860> okay<00:05:08.610> well<00:05:09.260> sand<00:05:10.260> now<00:05:10.520> we

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
like my water age okay well sand now we

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.760 
like my water age okay well sand now we
have<00:05:11.970> about<00:05:12.300> 10,000<00:05:13.080> well<00:05:13.350> this<00:05:13.470> impeller

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
have about 10,000 well this impeller

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.580 
have about 10,000 well this impeller
first<00:05:14.400> off<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:15.000> was<00:05:15.210> all<00:05:15.360> bent<00:05:15.660> right<00:05:16.440> in

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
first off this was all bent right in

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.710 
first off this was all bent right in
beat<00:05:16.800> up<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.190> saw<00:05:17.490> you<00:05:17.550> doll<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:18.000> up<00:05:18.180> well<00:05:18.510> i

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
beat up I saw you doll that up well i

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
beat up I saw you doll that up well i
weld<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.200> up<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.560> outside<00:05:20.720> because<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:22.380> had

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
weld it up the outside because it had

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.040 
weld it up the outside because it had
worn<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.650> outside<00:05:26.130> had<00:05:26.370> worn<00:05:26.640> down<00:05:26.940> so<00:05:27.810> we<00:05:27.930> had

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
worn the outside had worn down so we had

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.380 
worn the outside had worn down so we had
a<00:05:28.080> clearance<00:05:28.530> issue<00:05:28.830> there<00:05:29.220> because<00:05:30.030> we<00:05:30.210> need

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
a clearance issue there because we need

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.570 
a clearance issue there because we need
no<00:05:30.930> more<00:05:31.200> than<00:05:31.500> about<00:05:31.650> twenty<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.340> thirty

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
no more than about twenty to thirty

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.480 
no more than about twenty to thirty
thousand<00:05:33.180> right<00:05:33.690> here<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.950> pushes<00:05:35.220> the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
thousand right here so it pushes the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.580 
thousand right here so it pushes the
water<00:05:35.640> through<00:05:36.030> that<00:05:36.060> hole<00:05:36.450> okay<00:05:37.230> and<00:05:37.470> then

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
water through that hole okay and then

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.930 
water through that hole okay and then
our<00:05:37.740> other<00:05:37.890> clearance<00:05:38.340> was<00:05:38.490> down<00:05:38.640> here

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
our other clearance was down here

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.180 
our other clearance was down here
against<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.450> correct<00:05:39.930> angle<00:05:40.470> here<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:40.830> at

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
against this correct angle here so at

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.670 
against this correct angle here so at
this<00:05:41.370> point<00:05:41.930> we<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:44.360> about<00:05:45.360> 10<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.930> 20,000

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
this point we have about 10 to 20,000

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.629 
this point we have about 10 to 20,000
clearance<00:05:47.270> okay<00:05:51.230> yeah<00:05:52.230> we're<00:05:52.470> looking
