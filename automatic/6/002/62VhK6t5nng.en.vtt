allow<00:02:49.129> you<00:02:49.189> to<00:02:49.370> own<00:02:49.549> or<00:02:50.030> carry<00:02:50.540> i<00:02:50.659> guess<00:02:50.930> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
allow you to own or carry i guess a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.789 
allow you to own or carry i guess a
locking<00:02:51.650> blade<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.189> so<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.450> guess<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.319> blade

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
locking blade and so I guess this blade

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.580 
locking blade and so I guess this blade
is<00:02:55.040> under<00:02:55.579> their<00:02:55.790> 3-inch<00:02:56.299> limit<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.999> this

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
is under their 3-inch limit and this

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.690 
is under their 3-inch limit and this
play<00:03:00.590> doesn't<00:03:00.799> lock<00:03:01.159> so<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.939> fully<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:04.519> can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
play doesn't lock so it's fully you can

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.569 
play doesn't lock so it's fully you can
totally<00:03:04.849> carry<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.389> in<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:06.019> United<00:03:06.469> Kingdom

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579

can see here is held together by three
pins<00:03:55.879> those<00:03:56.720> pins<00:03:57.109> are<00:03:57.379> I<00:03:57.409> believe<00:03:57.709> t8<00:03:58.669> torx

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
pins those pins are I believe t8 torx

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.240 
pins those pins are I believe t8 torx
eight<00:03:59.629> so<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.379> could<00:04:00.590> totally<00:04:00.889> take<00:04:01.069> this

that<00:06:44.330> this<00:06:44.840> isn't<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.680> know<00:06:45.710> this<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:46.220> a<00:06:46.250> slip

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
joint pretty much the jumping up here is

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.970 
joint pretty much the jumping up here is
absolutely<00:06:50.110> pointless<00:06:51.110> in<00:06:51.590> my<00:06:51.680> opinion

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
absolutely pointless in my opinion

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.190 
absolutely pointless in my opinion
because<00:06:52.370> when<00:06:52.700> you<00:06:52.790> push<00:06:52.970> down<00:06:53.000> on<00:06:53.270> it<00:06:53.450> you're

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
because when you push down on it you're

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.330 
because when you push down on it you're
disengaging<00:06:54.620> the<00:06:54.980> lelaki<00:06:55.730> so<00:06:56.240> to<00:06:56.300> speak<00:06:57.250> so<00:06:58.250> it

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
disengaging the lelaki so to speak so it

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.520 
disengaging the lelaki so to speak so it
swings<00:06:58.460> just<00:06:58.670> completely<00:06:59.210> stupid<00:06:59.530> but

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
swings just completely stupid but

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.600 
swings just completely stupid but
