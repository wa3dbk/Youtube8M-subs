00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
do fit is there more room back there or

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.560 
do fit is there more room back there or
is<00:01:18.549> it<00:01:18.670> just<00:01:18.700> more<00:01:19.299> roomy<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.619> we<00:01:21.369> moved<00:01:22.270> some

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
is it just more roomy so we moved some

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.569 
is it just more roomy so we moved some
of<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.780> hardware<00:01:23.049> that<00:01:23.229> was<00:01:23.740> under<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.399> load

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
of the hardware that was under the load

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.020 
of the hardware that was under the load
floor<00:01:24.850> last<00:01:25.659> year<00:01:25.990> we<00:01:26.799> made<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.549> fuel<00:01:27.759> tank<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
floor last year we made it a fuel tank a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.700 
floor last year we made it a fuel tank a
little<00:01:28.090> bit<00:01:28.329> smaller<00:01:28.600> which<00:01:28.930> doesn't<00:01:29.470> affect

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
little bit smaller which doesn't affect

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.530 
little bit smaller which doesn't affect
the<00:01:29.799> cruising<00:01:30.159> range<00:01:30.310> it's<00:01:30.549> actually<00:01:30.909> greater

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
the cruising range it's actually greater

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.899 
the cruising range it's actually greater
but<00:01:31.899> that<00:01:32.590> allowed<00:01:32.920> us<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.130> move<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.820> stuff

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
but that allowed us to move that stuff

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.520 
but that allowed us to move that stuff
out<00:01:34.149> of<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.360> way<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.719> drop<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.110> load<00:01:35.290> floor

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
out of the way and drop the load floor

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.200 
out of the way and drop the load floor
so<00:01:35.770> now<00:01:35.890> it's<00:01:36.100> completely<00:01:36.549> flat<00:01:36.820> it's<00:01:37.119> a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
so now it's completely flat it's a

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.830 
so now it's completely flat it's a
little<00:01:37.450> bit<00:01:37.570> lower<00:01:39.149> we've<00:01:40.149> gone<00:01:40.329> to<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.540> tilt

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
little bit lower we've gone to a tilt

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.179 
little bit lower we've gone to a tilt
adjustable<00:01:41.409> headrest<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:41.890> think<00:01:42.070> you're

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
adjustable headrest I think you're

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.620 
adjustable headrest I think you're
unique<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.579> it's<00:01:42.820> pretty<00:01:42.969> cool<00:01:43.210> show<00:01:43.509> me

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
unique in that it's pretty cool show me

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.959 
unique in that it's pretty cool show me
that<00:01:43.659> so<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.439> that's<00:01:44.979> gonna<00:01:45.100> tilt<00:01:45.430> forward<00:01:45.820> a

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
that so that that's gonna tilt forward a

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.709 
that so that that's gonna tilt forward a
number<00:01:46.360> about<00:01:47.289> about<00:01:47.500> 5<00:01:47.799> detents<00:01:48.399> 4<00:01:49.119> or<00:01:49.240> 5<00:01:49.420> and

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
number about about 5 detents 4 or 5 and

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.279 
number about about 5 detents 4 or 5 and
then<00:01:49.840> when<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.079> reach<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.619> end<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.600> go

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
then when you reach the end you and go

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.170 
then when you reach the end you and go
one<00:01:53.469> more<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.860> bring<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.100> back<00:01:54.130> forward

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
one more and bring it back forward

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.440 
one more and bring it back forward

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.109 
this may sound strange but after from
both<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.329> 5-speed<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.619> CVT<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.520> I

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
both the 5-speed and now the CVT and I

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.660 
both the 5-speed and now the CVT and I
actually<00:02:05.299> like<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.689> CVT<00:02:06.079> better<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.950> 5-speed

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
actually like the CVT better the 5-speed

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.270 
actually like the CVT better the 5-speed
seems<00:02:08.030> underpowered<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.259> in<00:02:09.920> some<00:02:10.129> ways

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
seems underpowered and in some ways

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
horsepower and you've really got

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.600

something<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.340> something

something what is that something

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.539 
something what is that something
hopefully<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.510> two<00:02:35.660> years<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.379> new<00:02:36.500> WRX<00:02:37.129> and

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
hopefully in two years the new WRX and

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.589 
hopefully in two years the new WRX and
STI<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.629> is<00:02:38.840> its<00:02:39.019> own<00:02:39.170> car<00:02:39.640> WRX<00:02:40.640> STI<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.090> think

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
STI this is its own car WRX STI I think

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.390 
STI this is its own car WRX STI I think
it<00:02:41.660> was<00:02:41.750> we<00:02:41.930> previously<00:02:42.200> announced<00:02:42.530> they<00:02:42.769> kind

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it was we previously announced they kind

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.160 
it was we previously announced they kind
of<00:02:43.430> split<00:02:43.610> off<00:02:43.819> yeah<00:02:44.239> at<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.540> point<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.959> time

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
of split off yeah at this point in time

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.000 
of split off yeah at this point in time
so<00:02:45.950> last<00:02:46.370> year<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.910> redesigned<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:48.590> both<00:02:48.859> of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so last year we redesigned and both of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.860 
so last year we redesigned and both of
those<00:02:49.069> models<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.640> went<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.299> wide-body<00:02:50.510> on

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
those models we went to the wide-body on

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.710 
those models we went to the wide-body on
the<00:02:50.930> WRX<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.890> STI<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.910> went<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.209> you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the WRX and then the STI we went to you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.259 
the WRX and then the STI we went to you
know<00:02:53.810> offering<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.140> sedan<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:54.590> well<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.640> those

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
know offering a sedan as well so those

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.059 
know offering a sedan as well so those
cars<00:02:56.540> got<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.720> lot<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.989> updates<00:02:57.319> last<00:02:57.590> year<00:02:57.859> so

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
cars got a lot of updates last year so

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.080 
cars got a lot of updates last year so
they're<00:02:58.190> gonna<00:02:58.280> hang<00:02:58.519> around<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.790> little<00:02:58.879> bit

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
they're gonna hang around a little bit

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.970 
they're gonna hang around a little bit
longer<00:03:01.329> at<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.480> end<00:03:02.599> of<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> day<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.650> simple

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
longer at the end of the day the simple

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.710 
longer at the end of the day the simple
fact<00:03:04.190> remains<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.940> if<00:03:05.389> you<00:03:05.480> want<00:03:05.630> an

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
fact remains that if you want an

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.990 
fact remains that if you want an
all-wheel<00:03:06.139> drive<00:03:06.470> car<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.069> segment<00:03:07.310> the

all-wheel drive car in this segment the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.940 
all-wheel drive car in this segment the
Impreza<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.840> only<00:03:09.079> way<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.260> go<00:03:09.470> Lauren

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950

right here at the end of the roof rails

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.520 
right here at the end of the roof rails
what's<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.700> all<00:03:16.819> about<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.329> we<00:03:18.200> did<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.380> number

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
what's that all about so we did a number

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.110 
what's that all about so we did a number
of<00:03:18.739> things<00:03:18.889> to<00:03:19.069> reduce<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.519> drag<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:20.060> improve

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
of things to reduce the drag and improve

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.610 
of things to reduce the drag and improve
the<00:03:20.419> fuel<00:03:20.630> economy<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:21.049> Impreza

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the fuel economy on Impreza

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.770 
the fuel economy on Impreza
and<00:03:21.829> so<00:03:22.340> one<00:03:22.549> thing<00:03:22.579> we<00:03:22.880> found<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.389> that<00:03:23.419> when

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
and so one thing we found is that when

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.250 
and so one thing we found is that when
we<00:03:23.870> added<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.799> feature<00:03:25.099> in<00:03:25.459> our

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
we added this this feature in our

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.870 
we added this this feature in our
aerodynamics<00:03:27.260> testing<00:03:27.709> that's<00:03:28.220> adding<00:03:28.760> this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
aerodynamics testing that's adding this

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.909 
aerodynamics testing that's adding this
little<00:03:28.940> bump<00:03:29.359> smooth<00:03:30.109> out<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.470> airflow<00:03:30.889> and

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
little bump smooth out the airflow and

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.830 
little bump smooth out the airflow and
it<00:03:31.459> increases<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> highway<00:03:32.480> fuel<00:03:32.660> economy

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
it increases the highway fuel economy

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.949 
it increases the highway fuel economy
one<00:03:33.799> mile<00:03:34.040> per<00:03:34.069> gallon<00:03:34.700> from<00:03:34.910> what<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.810> would

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
one mile per gallon from what it would

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.390 
one mile per gallon from what it would
have<00:03:35.989> been<00:03:36.109> otherwise<00:03:36.500> that's<00:03:36.980> crazy<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
have been otherwise that's crazy that

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.280 
have been otherwise that's crazy that
little<00:03:37.819> hump<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.209> there<00:03:38.419> increases<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.139> by

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
little hump right there increases it by

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.849 
little hump right there increases it by
one<00:03:39.470> MPG<00:03:40.040> yeah<00:03:40.430> that's<00:03:40.639> correct
