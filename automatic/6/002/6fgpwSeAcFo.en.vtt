step one and you can see these bottles
are<00:02:36.769> twenty<00:02:37.769> five<00:02:37.980> millimeters<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:39.230> 0.85

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
are twenty five millimeters or 0.85

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
are twenty five millimeters or 0.85
fluid<00:02:40.890> ounces<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:44.069> water

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
fluid ounces this is just like water

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.050 
fluid ounces this is just like water
consistency<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.590> put<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.849> hair

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
in step two which basically activates

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.920 
in step two which basically activates
step<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:56.040> two<00:02:56.370> go<00:02:56.549> together<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.720> on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
step one so these two go together and on

step one so these two go together and on
the<00:02:58.049> box<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.440> says<00:02:58.470> leave<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.930> two
