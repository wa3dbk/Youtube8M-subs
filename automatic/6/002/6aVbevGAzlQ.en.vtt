reason to not buy mortal kombat x is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.569

their<00:00:55.170> idea<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.620> somehow<00:00:55.829> engage<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
their idea to somehow engage you in the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.790 
their idea to somehow engage you in the
story<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.239> bit<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.840> randomly

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
story just a little bit more randomly

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
story just a little bit more randomly
you'll<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.399> jump<00:00:59.699> into<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> quick<00:01:00.210> time<00:01:00.390> event

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you'll just jump into a quick time event

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
you'll just jump into a quick time event
and<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> time<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.289> button<00:01:01.739> presses<00:01:01.820> but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and have to time your button presses but

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.640 
and have to time your button presses but
there<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.090> problems<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
there are problems with this so the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050 
there are problems with this so the
story<00:01:04.920> cutscenes<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.489> sometimes<00:01:05.729> rather

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
story cutscenes are sometimes rather

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.820 
story cutscenes are sometimes rather
long<00:01:06.420> long<00:01:06.780> enough<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> sometimes<00:01:07.650> you'll

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
long long enough that sometimes you'll

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.289 
long long enough that sometimes you'll
put<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> controller<00:01:08.280> down<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> maybe<00:01:09.090> go

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
put the controller down and maybe go

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
put the controller down and maybe go
grab<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> snack<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.080> use<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> bathroom<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
grab a snack or use the bathroom and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
grab a snack or use the bathroom and
this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> where<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.670> problems<00:01:12.180> come<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
this is where my problems come in

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
this is where my problems come in
because<00:01:12.990> sometimes<00:01:13.650> there<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.369> quick

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
because sometimes there are no quick

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.219 
because sometimes there are no quick
time<00:01:14.820> events<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> characters<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.140> have

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
time events and the characters will have

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
time events and the characters will have
a<00:01:16.320> full-on<00:01:16.619> fight<00:01:17.009> without<00:01:17.220> any<00:01:17.490> button

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
a full-on fight without any button

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
a full-on fight without any button
presses<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.570> while<00:01:19.080> sometimes<00:01:19.409> they'll

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
presses from you while sometimes they'll

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
presses from you while sometimes they'll
begin<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> fight<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.030> boom<00:01:21.210> press

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
begin to fight and it's like boom press

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
begin to fight and it's like boom press
X<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.860> basically<00:01:23.070> feels<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.729> they

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
X it just basically feels like they

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
X it just basically feels like they
weren't<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.509> wanted<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> include

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
weren't sure if they wanted to include

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
weren't sure if they wanted to include
the<00:01:25.409> QuickTime<00:01:25.740> events<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the QuickTime events so they kind of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
the QuickTime events so they kind of
half-assed<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.710> second<00:01:29.100> reason<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.460> buy

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
half-assed it the second reason to buy

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
half-assed it the second reason to buy

me<00:02:58.599> I've<00:02:58.959> had<00:02:59.019> times<00:02:59.470> where<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> computer

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
me I've had times where the computer

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.530 
me I've had times where the computer
opponent<00:03:00.489> will<00:03:00.580> just<00:03:00.760> stand<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.120> eating

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
opponent will just stand there eating

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.880 
opponent will just stand there eating
the<00:03:01.660> damage<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.049> I'm<00:03:02.260> giving<00:03:02.500> him<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.739> his

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the damage that I'm giving him to his

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.280 
the damage that I'm giving him to his
face<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:03.880> sometimes<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.599> find<00:03:04.810> myself<00:03:05.049> at

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
face and then sometimes I find myself at

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.930 
face and then sometimes I find myself at
the<00:03:05.349> end<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.680> never-ending<00:03:06.040> combo<00:03:06.730> from

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the end of a never-ending combo from

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.910
