00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.310
 developing a site on juma 2.5 and this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.500
 I would like to devote a lesson to searching for a choice 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 selecting and installing a template that is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.570
 design for your site so let's start 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 where to look for patterns and how how 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.760
 choose use google but from 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.079
 best sites I can advise you 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.079
 Juma Master Point Org 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.719
 [music] 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.719
 further joon house dot com 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.199
 there are also many templates 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.030
 different and 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:07.640
 Joomla fan dot org this in general then 3 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 the site on which I'm looking for templates 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.740
 they always satisfy me completely 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.820
 here you can immediately download the template immediately 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 as well as view it demonstratively 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 demo version if you look 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.860
 here there is a button at home 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.650
 if you click on it you 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.040
 flips to the page with completely 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 installed sites on this template 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.430
 can twist it watch it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.610
 I have already downloaded the functionality so the template 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.610
 and 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:57.670
 and even installed I did it for 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:04.390
 save time but show you anyway 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.410
 how to make this template downloaded in 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.740
 like this 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.869
 archive you need to unpack 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.540
 here it is in unpacked form 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:20.670
 and here it consists of a series of files here 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 strictly speaking about directly 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.140
 file archive 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.800
 along with the template below is so 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.500
 called quickstart package about him i 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:41.320
 I'll tell you a little later and some 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.540
 plug-ins modules and framework in order 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.020
 make your new template work like 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.580
 follows so back to our site 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.880
 in order to install the template 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.870
 you must go to the extensions tab 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 extension manager and 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:17.920
 install the extension in the same way 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:20.110
 as I used to show you 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.600
 say also what is necessary 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:29.080
 install all desirable companies 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.740
 elements of your template except quickstart 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.870
 the package he will not stop at you through 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.860
 extension manager after installation 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.870
 the template gives you a message stating that 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:47.950
 the installation was successful and you can 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:53.380
 boldly go template manager and so 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:57.150
 here we see us here are our 3 patterns 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.540
 default site meaning templates 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.270
 design of the pages of our site as well 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.480
 two templates 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:11.650
 which you can choose for your 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.990
 administrative panel here choose 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.320
 The default template is possible with the help of 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.540
 these stars just click on them 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:28.300
 now we are changing the panel pattern 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:31.750
 management is interesting but previous 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.230
 better and that's the same pattern I 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.890
 chose for our site 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.600
 I set it by default so 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.230
 let's probably see what we have 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.230
 happened 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.919
 as you see the design is somewhat 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.449
 changed from what it was 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:06.300
 but our site is still not on it 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.199
 no information and he simply 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.240
 useless 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:14.639
 about how to fill it with information I 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.470
 I'll tell you in the next sixth 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.449
 the lesson 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.509
 like and add to favorites 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.660
 and subscribe to our channel 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.660
