00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.260
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.880
 which is called graby it is the result 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 of a concept you may have 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.299
 heard of and you will see that he 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.100
 is excellent since it will add 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.410
 other features or shortcut of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 the camera on the lockscreen 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 now you have others in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.359
 sliding to the left 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 the music the phone is finally the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.869
 sms you can slide up 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.090
 to open the application there is the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.300
 music is there it's the phone and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 finally for sms that's what it gives 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.489
 graby so are you really a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 excellent cydia tweak 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.420
 in addition it is very well integrated with ios 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 as you see it's really pretty 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 and in addition it is very useful since you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.219
 have access to others 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 applications directly from the screen 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 lock your iphone or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 your ipod touch so for now 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.020
 to the camera the music the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.850
 phone and sms but you have the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 opportunity to change all that here in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.149
 the grubby settings instead of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 the camera I can for example 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 choose to open the calculator so there 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.370
 you have the list of all the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.750
 applications that are installed on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.710
 your device same thing for the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.299
 music and for the other four 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 shortcuts you select 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.990
 the application you want and then 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.340
 you have direct access on the screen of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 lock your iphone or your 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.010
 ipod touch 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 this is the phone there is the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 music and there it will be now the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.570
 calculator 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.700
 so that's how it works if the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 four basic shortcuts and the sms the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 phone music and camera 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.229
 you do not like you have the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 opportunity to exchange it in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 tweak graby settings here you 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 just select in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.650
 the application among those who are 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.299
 installed on your device the one that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 you want to replace in the shortcut 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.479
 there for example it will be so dia instead 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.820
 music 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 then to open the application it's 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 everything simple you move your finger 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.729
 on the shortcut that you like and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.710
 you slide up the tweak 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.360
 is called krabi like those here 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.250
 is available for free on cydia 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.079
 on the source of the developer for 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.369
 the moment so look at the description 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.630
 from the video just down I have you 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.420
 added the source that will have to be put 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 in cydia to have the draghi tweak there 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.570
 is still in the test phase so it's 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 possible that you have some small 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.820
 operating bugs 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.770
 it does not look like it works 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.180
 perfectly and you see he's 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.590
 as I told you extremely 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.849
 practice since you have all the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.899
 useful shortcuts on the screen of 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.360
 locking your device 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 at the base it was a concept now 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.400
 it's a real 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.900
 the idea so tell me in the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 comments what did you think of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.260
 grubby follow me on facebook and on 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.730
