00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
your first my lab as i said is going to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.690 
your first my lab as i said is going to
be<00:01:39.659> 67<00:01:40.290> minutes<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.579> more

any lower than that I feel I come slow i

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.830 
any lower than that I feel I come slow i
thought<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.700> i'm<00:02:18.850> using<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> LMG<00:02:19.570> just

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
thought like i'm using the LMG just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.180
