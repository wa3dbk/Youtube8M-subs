 we are again playstation 3 equipment 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:20.180
 how to create a server and it's very easy 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:26.119
 the truth that to do this is good 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:30.240
 is the easiest is to play game 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.470
 this is a server that I have done with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.470
 my friends that we are 4 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.650
 OK 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.870
 the seed just like the easy computer 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.829
 of creative survival game appears 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 these two 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:05.129
 a part of easy texture 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.369
 come on, you subscribe, good 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.380
 I have here vale 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.910
 and I recommend that you give him here 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.360
 online match this will be part of the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.390
 server that they will come 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.910
 I prÃ© finished so when your paper 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.160
 a milestone with the friends that I have of mica 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.940
 for that reason and here and only for 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 invitation almost does not join you all 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.970
 world I think he is a writer 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.729
 allow friends and friends is to say me 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.760
 I would remove it if you want them to join by 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.430
 get more insecure 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.710
 in player against player this is pepe 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.580
 valdÃ©s you can stay in three the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.440
 players have players 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.590
 but under what he says that this is not what 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.590
 is 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.090
 if something is down if I think of players 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.110
 they can break and do any 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.789
 thing if not, well, if you see it here, 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.869
 it will only break anything or 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.869
 We are going to use 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.050
 the fire spread that if it goes on 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.580
 something by the way it will start to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.580
 propagate as a normal teacher 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.390
 after 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 you understand efectivice the dynamite 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610
 putting paraplegics is like that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.739
 to fly 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.739
 The depletion 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.940
 normal current experience of the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.340
 culture is to say to have towns and everything 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.170
 that there is good superplane and catch 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.290
 bonuses so that when a house 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.120
 and a car but bring your 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.700
 wide or not being randomly have 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.700
 It's worth later until we've touched 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 all this here we go back and here 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.740
 the world is worth and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.090
 it's not being started to create 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.800
 and when it is then starts after 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.570
 power all the people who do not want 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.900
 issue you and that gives them the option 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.240
 to join friends by invitation what good 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.600
