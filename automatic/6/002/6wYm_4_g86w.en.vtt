me in regards to my long-acting insulin

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.290 
me in regards to my long-acting insulin
is<00:02:54.140> I've<00:02:54.440> split<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.670> take<00:02:55.849> half<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.239> the

morning half at night

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.020 
morning half at night
which<00:02:57.650> gives<00:02:58.099> me<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> little<00:02:58.489> bit<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.790> freedom

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
which gives me a little bit more freedom

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.750

rapid-acting insulin quite a bit after
exercise<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.400> tend<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.790> get<00:03:07.910> more<00:03:08.120> sensitive<00:03:08.690> to

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800 
exercise I tend to get more sensitive to
insulin<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:09.769> I'll<00:03:10.099> back<00:03:10.370> off<00:03:10.580> both<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.480> my

also keeping glucose nearby if you know
in<00:05:33.250> case<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.520> were<00:05:33.669> to<00:05:33.759> need<00:05:33.909> it

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.600 

you<00:05:38.200> know<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.440> main<00:05:38.620> difference<00:05:39.070> for<00:05:39.280> me<00:05:39.430> and

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
you know the main difference for me and

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.520 
you know the main difference for me and
my<00:05:39.730> diabetes<00:05:40.330> management<00:05:40.450> between<00:05:40.900> racing

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
my diabetes management between racing

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.010 
my diabetes management between racing
and<00:05:41.830> training<00:05:41.890> is<00:05:42.550> really<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.600> adrenaline

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
and training is really the adrenaline

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.670 
and training is really the adrenaline
factor

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
factor

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.220 
factor
I<00:05:44.710> treat<00:05:45.280> training<00:05:46.270> and<00:05:46.390> racing<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.840> same<00:05:47.080> way

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
I treat training and racing the same way

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.900 
I treat training and racing the same way
it<00:05:47.320> comes<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.590> my<00:05:47.710> diabetes<00:05:48.070> management<00:05:48.310> I

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
it comes to my diabetes management I

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.290 
it comes to my diabetes management I
need<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.570> practice<00:05:49.780> every<00:05:50.500> day<00:05:50.710> as<00:05:51.160> close<00:05:52.150> to

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
need to practice every day as close to

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.750 
need to practice every day as close to
the<00:05:52.420> real<00:05:52.660> thing<00:05:52.990> as<00:05:53.050> possible<00:05:53.430> so<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.490> treat

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
the real thing as possible so I treat

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.820 
the real thing as possible so I treat
every<00:05:55.000> training<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.990> same<00:05:56.260> as<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.500> treat<00:05:56.740> a

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
every training the same as I treat a

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.460 
every training the same as I treat a
race<00:05:57.010> day<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.550> go<00:05:58.150> through<00:05:58.420> the<00:05:58.540> same<00:05:58.780> steps<00:05:59.230> in

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
race day I go through the same steps in

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.630 
race day I go through the same steps in
the<00:05:59.710> same<00:05:59.980> process

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
the same process

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.510 
the same process
every<00:06:01.270> day<00:06:01.480> at<00:06:02.140> restart<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:03.130> know<00:06:03.250> when<00:06:03.400> I'm

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
every day at restart you know when I'm

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.250 
every day at restart you know when I'm
at<00:06:03.670> that<00:06:03.790> starting<00:06:04.090> line<00:06:04.150> that's<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.050> one

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
at that starting line that's the one

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.900 
at that starting line that's the one
difference<00:06:05.650> for<00:06:05.800> me<00:06:05.950> everything<00:06:06.460> else<00:06:06.640> from

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
difference for me everything else from

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.330 
difference for me everything else from
nutrition<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.690> testing<00:06:08.410> my<00:06:08.530> sugars<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.040> carry

nutrition to testing my sugars to carry
an<00:06:09.430> insulin<00:06:09.730> is<00:06:10.000> pretty<00:06:10.240> much<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.510> same<00:06:10.690> but

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
an insulin is pretty much the same but

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.830 
an insulin is pretty much the same but
needing<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.920> have<00:06:12.100> a<00:06:12.130> little<00:06:12.490> bit<00:06:12.610> extra<00:06:12.910> fast

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
needing to have a little bit extra fast

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.190 
needing to have a little bit extra fast
acting<00:06:14.290> insulin<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:15.610> adjust<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.480> counteract

acting insulin to adjust and counteract

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.170 
acting insulin to adjust and counteract
that<00:06:17.470> adrenaline<00:06:18.040> factor<00:06:18.400> that's<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.970> really

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
that adrenaline factor that's the really

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.080 
that adrenaline factor that's the really
the<00:06:19.300> main<00:06:19.450> difference

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
the main difference

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.910 
the main difference
everybody's<00:06:22.090> diabetes<00:06:22.690> is<00:06:22.870> different<00:06:23.320> so<00:06:23.800> if

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
everybody's diabetes is different so if

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.950 
everybody's diabetes is different so if
you<00:06:24.040> have<00:06:24.250> diabetes<00:06:24.790> make<00:06:25.420> sure<00:06:25.600> you<00:06:25.750> work

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
you have diabetes make sure you work

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.510 
you have diabetes make sure you work
with<00:06:25.990> your<00:06:26.170> healthcare<00:06:26.530> professional<00:06:26.890> to
