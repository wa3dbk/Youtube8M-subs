00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
better the cars is a unique idea I don't
think<00:01:35.939> I've<00:01:36.060> ever<00:01:36.210> seen<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.720> before<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.079> don't

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
think I've ever seen this before I don't

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.399 
think I've ever seen this before I don't
think<00:01:37.380> I've<00:01:37.500> ever<00:01:37.619> seen<00:01:37.799> cars<00:01:38.100> along<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
think I've ever seen cars along the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
think I've ever seen cars along the
ramps<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.530> whatnot<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.860> cover<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
ramps and whatnot to cover it up you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
ramps and whatnot to cover it up you
know<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> already<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> core<00:01:43.710> idea<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
know so I already like the core idea but

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469 
know so I already like the core idea but
I<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> could<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.180> probably

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I really think you could have probably

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.350 
I really think you could have probably
add<00:01:45.720> something<00:01:46.049> else<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:47.090> or<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
add something else to it more or it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.580 
add something else to it more or it
could<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.049> could<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.290> been<00:01:49.380> done<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
could be it could have been done a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.170 
could be it could have been done a
little<00:01:49.740> bit<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:49.979> differently<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> cars

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little bit more differently but the cars

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.370 
little bit more differently but the cars
are<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.540> cool<00:01:51.720> because<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
are really cool because you know I'm a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
are really cool because you know I'm a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you is also have DLC i really like these

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
you is also have DLC i really like these
ramps<00:02:00.899> also<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.350> well<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.829> there's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
ramps also as well you know there's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.800 
ramps also as well you know there's
basically<00:02:02.520> half<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> pipes<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
basically half of pipes going all the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
basically half of pipes going all the
way<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:03.930> i<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.130> idea<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
way down i really like this idea of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
way down i really like this idea of
these<00:02:05.790> pipes<00:02:06.030> i<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.360> even<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.840> I've<00:02:06.990> seen

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
these pipes i don't even think I've seen

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.839 
these pipes i don't even think I've seen
these<00:02:07.350> pipes<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.429> down<00:02:08.640> like

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
these pipes like this going down like

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
these pipes like this going down like
this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.810> ones<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.200> split<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.560> half

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
this is the ones that are split in half

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.020 
this is the ones that are split in half
I<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.879> think<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.510> have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
I don't really think I have

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.580 
I don't really think I have
but<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.300> 30<00:02:13.510> gladly<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:14.170> apartment

good job on that and then we obviously
got<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:17.230> rail<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:17.709> usually<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.640> every

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
got a rail right here usually like every

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.449 
got a rail right here usually like every
Park<00:02:19.300> has<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.500> rail<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.770> going<00:02:21.220> straight

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
Park has the rail just going straight

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.160 
Park has the rail just going straight
down<00:02:21.490> like<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> little

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
down like that I want to see a little

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.840 
down like that I want to see a little
bit<00:02:23.319> more<00:02:23.590> creative<00:02:23.950> rail<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.520> know<00:02:24.610> not<00:02:24.819> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bit more creative rail you know not just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.850 
bit more creative rail you know not just
a<00:02:25.090> plain<00:02:25.300> old<00:02:25.330> rail<00:02:25.630> going<00:02:25.959> down<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.410> want<00:02:26.770> to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
a plain old rail going down I want to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.080 
a plain old rail going down I want to
see<00:02:26.950> someone<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.400> gets<00:02:27.520> actually<00:02:27.880> really

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
see someone that gets actually really

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
see someone that gets actually really
creative<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.569> rows<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.110> then<00:02:29.470> right

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
creative with the rows and then right

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.780 
creative with the rows and then right
here<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> right<00:02:30.069> side<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.340> got<00:02:30.430> another

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
here on the right side we got another

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.309 
here on the right side we got another
ramp<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.270> within<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.690> round<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.020> got<00:02:32.170> these

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
ramp and within the round we got these

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.320 
ramp and within the round we got these
miniature<00:02:32.800> ramps<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.850> pretty<00:02:34.060> cool<00:02:34.300> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
miniature ramps and it's pretty cool I

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.150 
miniature ramps and it's pretty cool I
really<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:34.959> idea<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.470> know<00:02:35.590> actually

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
really like this idea you know actually

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.130 
really like this idea you know actually
I<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.430> actually<00:02:36.580> probably<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.209> some<00:02:37.870> kind<00:02:38.110> of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
I can actually probably do some kind of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.690 
I can actually probably do some kind of
a<00:02:38.260> line<00:02:38.530> right<00:02:38.800> here<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.010> don't<00:02:39.100> know<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:39.340> I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
a line right here I don't know if I

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.000 
a line right here I don't know if I
actually<00:02:40.569> what<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.110> do<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.380> right<00:02:41.739> but

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
actually what to do with that right but

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.530 
actually what to do with that right but
I<00:02:42.130> really<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.670> idea<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:43.030> don't<00:02:43.330> think

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
I really like the idea I don't think

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.020 
I really like the idea I don't think
I've<00:02:43.840> seen<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.170> either<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.310> that's<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.730> really

obviously it's a glow Park and I

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.000

actually like glow parts because it's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.199 
actually like glow parts because it's
something<00:03:39.310> really<00:03:39.489> unique<00:03:39.670> something<00:03:40.030> you

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
something really unique something you

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.240

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
kind of hard to pull off because you

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.500

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
thing I do have to say is that you

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.070 
thing I do have to say is that you
probably<00:04:46.030> should<00:04:46.300> have<00:04:46.330> added<00:04:46.510> a<00:04:46.750> little<00:04:46.900> bit

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
probably should have added a little bit

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.710 
probably should have added a little bit
more<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.710> know<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.100> would<00:04:48.820> love<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.330> see<00:04:49.510> more
