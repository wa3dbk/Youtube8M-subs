the blades a never fan of Kanto but with
this<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.600> I've<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.710> some<00:00:55.890> rust<00:00:56.070> problems<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this one I've had some rust problems and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.020 
this one I've had some rust problems and
I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.039> finish<00:00:59.760> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
I think that's because of the finish a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720 
I think that's because of the finish a
big<00:01:00.780> blast<00:01:01.020> finish<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.710> great<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.340> preventing

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
big blast finish is great for preventing

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600 
big blast finish is great for preventing
you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> glare<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.080> shine<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.460> see

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you know glare or shine as you can see

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
you know glare or shine as you can see
as<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> move<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> light<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.510> shining

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
as I move for the light it's not shining

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
as I move for the light it's not shining
as<00:01:07.170> much<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.010> other<00:01:08.189> knives<00:01:08.450> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
as much as from my other knives so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.070 
as much as from my other knives so
that's<00:01:09.630> good

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that's good

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
that's good
the<00:01:10.470> downside<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> beat<00:01:12.000> blast<00:01:12.270> some

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the downside is when you beat blast some

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.850 
the downside is when you beat blast some
it<00:01:12.630> leaves<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.990> kinds<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.439> pits<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it leaves all kinds little pits and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
it leaves all kinds little pits and
that's<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.220> disseminates<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> light<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that's what disseminates the light it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
that's what disseminates the light it
also<00:01:15.810> leaves<00:01:16.229> areas<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:18.049> excuse<00:01:19.049> me<00:01:19.460> rust

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
also leaves areas for excuse me rust

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
also leaves areas for excuse me rust
causing<00:01:20.880> bacteria<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> other<00:01:21.720> kinds<00:01:22.020> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
causing bacteria and other kinds of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
causing bacteria and other kinds of
stuff<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.590> stuck<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> they're<00:01:23.369> really

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
stuff to get stuck in they're really

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
stuff to get stuck in they're really
hard<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.200> probably<00:01:25.500> why

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
hard to get out and that's probably why

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.179 
hard to get out and that's probably why
I've<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.220> rust<00:01:27.000> problems<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.890> both<00:01:28.890> are

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I've had rust problems with it both are

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
I've had rust problems with it both are
plenty<00:01:29.549> sharp<00:01:29.869> obviously<00:01:30.869> no<00:01:31.049> problems<00:01:31.500> with

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
plenty sharp obviously no problems with

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.670 
plenty sharp obviously no problems with
this<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.189> black<00:01:32.340> oxide<00:01:32.759> coating

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
this because it's black oxide coating

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
this because it's black oxide coating
and<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.090> good<00:01:36.360> anybody

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and that's that's really good anybody

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.300 
and that's that's really good anybody

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
kind of like saying the car is steering

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.490 
kind of like saying the car is steering
real<00:01:39.750> nowadays<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.659> diesel<00:01:42.659> II<00:01:42.869> nicer<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> do

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
drop point you know you have a really

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
drop point you know you have a really
nice<00:01:48.570> part<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.259> outward<00:01:49.500> curve<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
nice part that this outward curve that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
nice part that this outward curve that
you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.210> focus<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.810> cut<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you can like focus a cut on and this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
you can like focus a cut on and this
inward<00:01:53.100> curve<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> concave<00:01:53.700> curve<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
inward curve is concave curve in the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
inward curve is concave curve in the
back<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.710> nice<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> precision<00:01:56.640> cutting

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
back really nice for a precision cutting

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 
back really nice for a precision cutting
as<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.619> natural<00:01:58.979> curve<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
as that that natural curve is going to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
as that that natural curve is going to
help<00:01:59.670> focus<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> cutting<00:02:01.469> into<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> into

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
help focus the cutting into that into

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.859 
help focus the cutting into that into
that<00:02:02.549> inward<00:02:02.880> area<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> have

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that inward area you're going to have

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.450 
that inward area you're going to have
very<00:02:03.899> little<00:02:04.320> slippage<00:02:04.770> when<00:02:04.799> making<00:02:05.070> your

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
very little slippage when making your

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
very little slippage when making your
so<00:02:05.730> that's<00:02:05.880> actually<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:06.240> nice<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:07.350> love<00:02:08.070> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so that's actually very nice I love this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.870 
so that's actually very nice I love this
our<00:02:09.600> clock<00:02:09.960> it's<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> access<00:02:11.730> box

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
our clock it's much like the access box

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.990 
our clock it's much like the access box
by<00:02:12.060> benchmade<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.320> theory<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
by benchmade so in theory you can do the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.430 
by benchmade so in theory you can do the
flick<00:02:15.270> thing<00:02:15.540> although<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.810> doesn't<00:02:16.200> work<00:02:16.290> as

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
flick thing although it doesn't work as

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.380 
flick thing although it doesn't work as
well<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.710> these<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.730> blades<00:02:18.210> are

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
well on these because the blades are

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420 
well on these because the blades are
just<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.690> heavy<00:02:18.960> enough<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just not heavy enough to get the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.140 
just not heavy enough to get the
momentum<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.890> close<00:02:22.890> them<00:02:23.160> very

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
momentum but I can close them very

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.200 
momentum but I can close them very
quickly<00:02:24.420> very<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:25.020> resistance

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
quickly very little resistance

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.910 
quickly very little resistance
conclusion<00:02:27.210> without<00:02:27.540> ever<00:02:27.870> putting<00:02:28.530> my

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820

nothing too special I mean the

forefinger<00:02:53.670> groove<00:02:53.880> right<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.810> put

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
forefinger groove right here you can put

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.370 
forefinger groove right here you can put
you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.260> put<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:56.090> jimping<00:02:57.230> they<00:02:58.230> could

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you can put that in jimping they could

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.560 
you can put that in jimping they could
do<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> better<00:02:58.680> job<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> jimping<00:02:59.610> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
do a better job with the jimping the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.120 
do a better job with the jimping the
might<00:03:00.720> test<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.140> dipping<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.830> put<00:03:02.010> my

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
might test for dipping is if I put my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.130 
might test for dipping is if I put my
thumb<00:03:02.340> right<00:03:02.490> normally<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> try<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> move<00:03:04.050> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
thumb right normally and try to move it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.690 
thumb right normally and try to move it
back<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> forth<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.070> see<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:05.370> thumb

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
back and forth as you can see my thumb

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
back and forth as you can see my thumb
does<00:03:06.300> slide<00:03:06.750> back<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.170> forth<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.740> knife

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
does slide back and forth on the knife

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.970 
does slide back and forth on the knife
so<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:09.720> need<00:03:09.900> more<00:03:10.080> jimping<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so they need more jimping and and the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.949 
so they need more jimping and and the
other<00:03:11.070> side<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.580> if<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.120> just<00:03:12.150> press<00:03:12.690> down

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
other side is if you just press down

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.560 
other side is if you just press down
with<00:03:13.019> your<00:03:13.290> thumb<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.130> feel<00:03:14.370> pain<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
with your thumb and you feel pain you

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.150 
with your thumb and you feel pain you
know<00:03:15.660> that's<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.019> good<00:03:16.200> thing<00:03:16.380> either<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.130> I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
know that's not a good thing either so I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
know that's not a good thing either so I
don't<00:03:17.220> feel<00:03:17.550> any<00:03:17.700> pain<00:03:18.030> but<00:03:18.930> my<00:03:19.230> thumb<00:03:19.709> can

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
don't feel any pain but my thumb can

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.350 
don't feel any pain but my thumb can
move<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.430> think<00:03:20.700> they<00:03:20.820> could<00:03:21.060> put

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
move so I think they could put

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.990 
move so I think they could put
additional<00:03:21.720> jinping<00:03:22.470> along<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> top<00:03:23.610> spine

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
additional jinping along the top spine

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.170 
additional jinping along the top spine
right<00:03:24.480> about<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.820> open<00:03:27.060> back

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
right about here I do like the open back

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.840 
right about here I do like the open back
design<00:03:27.360> makes<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.140> much<00:03:28.320> easier<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.800> clean<00:03:29.070> it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
design makes it much easier to clean it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
design makes it much easier to clean it

does close at the bottom button and

does close at the bottom button and
still<00:03:32.070> reasonably<00:03:32.459> get<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.790> there<00:03:32.940> with<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
still reasonably get in there with a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.380 
still reasonably get in there with a
q-tip<00:03:33.390> without<00:03:33.959> too<00:03:34.080> much<00:03:34.230> trouble

pop<00:03:36.390> loop<00:03:36.630> is<00:03:36.780> reversible<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.620> what<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:37.980> do

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
pop loop is reversible and what you do

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.890 
pop loop is reversible and what you do
is<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.370> unscrew<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.540> this

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
is you unscrew this and you just this

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.630 
is you unscrew this and you just this
just<00:03:40.110> pulls<00:03:40.350> out<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:41.070> switch<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.430> over<00:03:41.519> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
just pulls out and you switch it over to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.729 
just pulls out and you switch it over to
the<00:03:41.700> other<00:03:41.760> side<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.470> fact<00:03:43.620> that

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
the other side and I like the fact that

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.699 
the other side and I like the fact that
they<00:03:43.890> use<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> Phillips<00:03:44.459> head<00:03:44.519> because<00:03:44.910> um<00:03:45.709> you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
they use a Phillips head because um you

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.160 
they use a Phillips head because um you
know<00:03:46.800> not<00:03:46.980> everyone<00:03:47.400> has<00:03:47.700> hex<00:03:48.090> key<00:03:48.330> screws<00:03:48.750> you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
know not everyone has hex key screws you

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.979 
know not everyone has hex key screws you
know<00:03:49.320> or<00:03:49.590> hex<00:03:49.890> key<00:03:50.070> wrench<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.640> know

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
know or hex key wrench is you know

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.699 
know or hex key wrench is you know
however<00:03:51.989> everyone<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.500> pretty<00:03:52.650> much

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
however everyone is pretty much

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.900 
however everyone is pretty much
guaranteed<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.250> have<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> Phillips<00:03:53.790> head

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
guaranteed to have a Phillips head

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.610 
guaranteed to have a Phillips head
screwdriver<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.290> fact<00:03:55.470> that
