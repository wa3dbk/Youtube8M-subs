00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's a little bit more sleek for my

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's a little bit more sleek for my

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
taste but as you can see it's pretty

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
taste but as you can see it's pretty
it's<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.649> small<00:00:50.660> if<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.140> like

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's pretty small if it's a little like

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
it's pretty small if it's a little like
they're<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> head<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:55.260> uses

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
they're a little bit in the head it uses

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.540 
they're a little bit in the head it uses
only<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.600> triple<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> battery<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.430> an

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
only one triple a battery I would use an

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.750 
only one triple a battery I would use an
alkaline<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.270> its<00:01:01.430> last<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.579> little

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
alkaline because its last a little

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.250 
alkaline because its last a little
longer<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:04.619> power<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.369> higher

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
longer and the power is a little higher

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
longer and the power is a little higher
so<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> pretty<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.460> light<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.700> then

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
