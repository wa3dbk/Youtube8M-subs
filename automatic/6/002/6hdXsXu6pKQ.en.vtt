how do we hold and handle our pet snakes

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.799 
how do we hold and handle our pet snakes
it's<00:00:08.309> very<00:00:08.610> important<00:00:09.059> number<00:00:09.179> one<00:00:09.480> to

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
it's very important number one to

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.089 
it's very important number one to
understand<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> type<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.710> snake<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.040> you

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
understand the type of snake that you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.860 
understand the type of snake that you
have<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> ball<00:00:12.210> python

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
have now this is a ball python

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
have now this is a ball python
he's<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> constrictor<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.730> very

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
he's a constrictor and it's very

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.400 
he's a constrictor and it's very
important<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.750> give<00:00:15.960> him<00:00:15.990> something

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
important that you give him something

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.710 
important that you give him something
that<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.980> back<00:00:17.160> end<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.580> him<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:18.000> hold<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
that the back end of him can hold on to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.320 
that the back end of him can hold on to
so<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.680> back<00:00:19.890> one-third<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.670> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> wrap

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
so the back one-third you want to wrap

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.290 
so the back one-third you want to wrap
around<00:00:21.359> your<00:00:22.140> arm<00:00:22.410> around<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> smaller

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
around your arm around for the smaller

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.200 
around your arm around for the smaller
ones<00:00:24.539> around<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.990> finger<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.439> then<00:00:26.369> control

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
ones around the finger and then control

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.330 
ones around the finger and then control
the<00:00:27.240> middle<00:00:27.630> half<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.920> guys<00:00:29.130> are

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the middle half and then these guys are

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.250 
the middle half and then these guys are
docile<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.970> give<00:00:30.150> them<00:00:30.420> some<00:00:30.630> room<00:00:30.840> let<00:00:31.080> them

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
docile so give them some room let them

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.720 
docile so give them some room let them
explore<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.859> ever<00:00:31.980> let<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.250> look<00:00:32.430> around

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
explore you ever let them look around

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
explore you ever let them look around
you<00:00:33.149> don't<00:00:33.360> need<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> control<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> head

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you don't need to control the head

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.389 
you don't need to control the head
alright

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
alright

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
alright
the<00:00:35.850> snake<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.750> where<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> head<00:00:37.320> goes<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the snake will go where the head goes so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
the snake will go where the head goes so
if<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> snake<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.670> heading<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.059> way<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.540> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
if the snake is heading this way it's a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.170 
if the snake is heading this way it's a
simple<00:00:39.960> thing<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.379> moving<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.610> snake<00:00:41.910> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
simple thing of just moving the snake in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750 
simple thing of just moving the snake in
a<00:00:42.629> different<00:00:42.989> direction<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a different direction and that's how you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
a different direction and that's how you
can<00:00:45.030> control<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
can control them they go the way that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.430 
can control them they go the way that
their<00:00:47.039> head<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.399> pointed<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
their head is pointed if you have to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
their head is pointed if you have to
control<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> head<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:50.940> important

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
control the head it is very important

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.330 
control the head it is very important
that<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.140> hold<00:00:52.350> along<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> base<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.270> head

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
that you hold along the base of the head

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
that you hold along the base of the head
so<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.090> control<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.410> teeth<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
so that way you can control the teeth in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
so that way you can control the teeth in
the<00:00:58.859> biting<00:00:59.160> area<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> notice<00:01:00.359> I

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the biting area but if you notice I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
the biting area but if you notice I
don't<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> pressure<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
don't have a lot of pressure on the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
don't have a lot of pressure on the
bottom<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> snake<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.989> reason<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bottom of the snake and the reason for

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
bottom of the snake and the reason for
that<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> windpipe<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that is that's where the windpipe is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.020 
that is that's where the windpipe is
goes<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> lung<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.400> squeeze<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
goes down into the lung if we squeeze in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450 
goes down into the lung if we squeeze in
this<00:01:09.180> area<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.830> poor<00:01:11.040> guy<00:01:11.189> can't

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this area here then this poor guy can't

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
this area here then this poor guy can't
breathe<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:12.930> more

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
breathe and he will get a lot more

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.520 
breathe and he will get a lot more
feisty<00:01:13.409> than<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.610> controlling<00:01:14.850> his<00:01:15.299> head

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
feisty than just by controlling his head

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.940 
feisty than just by controlling his head
so<00:01:16.530> any<00:01:16.799> constrictor<00:01:17.810> control<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> back<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so any constrictor control the back so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
so any constrictor control the back so
he<00:01:20.100> feels<00:01:20.310> secure<00:01:20.570> support<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> middle<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
he feels secure support the middle and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
he feels secure support the middle and
most<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.490> docile<00:01:23.939> larger

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
most of the time you're docile larger

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380 
most of the time you're docile larger
snakes<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.900> fine<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.490> remember<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> with

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
snakes are fine now remember that with

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
snakes are fine now remember that with
your<00:01:27.540> larger<00:01:27.930> pythons<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> constrictors<00:01:29.159> if

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
your larger pythons and constrictors if

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.569 
your larger pythons and constrictors if
your<00:01:29.970> snake<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.450> longer<00:01:30.900> than<00:01:31.020> 4<00:01:31.380> feet<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
your snake is longer than 4 feet you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.109 
your snake is longer than 4 feet you
need<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.210> person<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.840> every<00:01:33.869> four<00:01:34.470> feet

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
need one person for every four feet

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
need one person for every four feet
because<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.840> very<00:01:37.079> powerful<00:01:37.380> snakes

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because they are very powerful snakes

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.819 
because they are very powerful snakes
and<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.119> wrap<00:01:39.360> around<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:40.650> your

neck or something of that nature you're
going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> need<00:01:43.770> someone<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> help<00:01:44.420> unwind<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
going to need someone to help unwind the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
going to need someone to help unwind the
snake<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.070> stronger<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> front

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
snake they are stronger in the front

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
snake they are stronger in the front
half<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> weaker<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.290> head<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.130> if

snake
now<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> reason<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.829> one

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
now the reason for that is is this one

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
now the reason for that is is this one
is<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> common<00:01:59.790> pet<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.329> they<00:02:00.509> aren't

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.530 
is a common pet but they aren't
constrictors<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.729> tend<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
constrictors so they tend to want to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
constrictors so they tend to want to
