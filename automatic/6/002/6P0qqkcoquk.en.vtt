00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 I am that stable to write this 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.240
 we can be here 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.990
 they disappeared completely 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.560
 and I do not know what happened 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.539
 you know I was so shocked at the idea of ​​being 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.720
 good and the other bad 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.279
 but still I did not give me overcome me 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.789
 I will continue fighting for ours until 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.960
 that sent 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.960
 others can not stand 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.170
 we were both to blame as we expected 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 all without delivering anything 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.310
 we said that the wait was always worth the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.620
 pain 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.690
 we are so happy with that phrase 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.060
 until the relationship just died 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.240
 You tell me you got tired and I wonder 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.240
 of what 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.880
 becomes ours 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.900
 but since I simply did not release this 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.900
 so strong that I feel 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.020
 maybe if you put yourself in my place 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.830
 you would understand why he was doing it but that 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 It would be a tall order 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.549
 you say that you no longer feel or feel anything 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.549
 for me 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.250
 it is interesting to show what happened and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.220
 especially when you ask me what they did 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.860
 the chapter but as if every time 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 we are back to the same thing we 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.880
 we stare and our lips 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 They end up doing what we want so much 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.130
 more and more I understand less 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.520
 is to recognize that we are something outside of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520
 common 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.890
 suddenly we decided not to be together and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 then we feel that great need to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.060
 know about each other 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.159
 we finish also 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.600
 so that after that you regret it and 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.330
 take me out of your life as if I do not 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 have feelings 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.500
 now there is no more 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.050
 the world does not revolve around you and it's 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.050
 accept that everything is what you felt 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 you did not want to wait for it to come back but 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 it was hard for you to wait 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.150
 you forgot that waiting for us 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.150
 it was always worth it it's true
