00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.160
 so love people another video about 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:17.310
 Mina sentence today is about the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:19.440
 so-called natural performance mails me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 let's see here at the camera in looks 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.190
 right now a lot of fun but 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.990
 now here it totally means yes already 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.750
 actually have one or the other 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 interesting information will follow now and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.090
 Although I have this powerful 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.040
 Steel bows one or the other if he has much 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.710
 of course is always on the go 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 excellent is another good 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 protein to have me with it 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.219
 I did not even think I would try this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.500
 whole times out and will you guys 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.989
 participate as I find the whole first 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 times of the packaging relatively small 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 yes here is a lot with 100% natural 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 So this problem with the marketing 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 food natural is actually today 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 On almost every product it is here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 still with stated hey protein 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.560
 Run free in two and a half minutes 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.869
 to prepare it is said and I read 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.399
 times is the information 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.509
 we have one here altogether 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.439
 energy balance 493 kilojoule so 103 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.709
 kilocalories eleven percent protein scarce 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.469
 then have eight percent carbohydrates 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.340
 we because of one percent sugar okay the 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.560
 I already have in the last video 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.950
 let sound 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.599
 that's standard with really today 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 convenience products or really 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.130
 products that you can buy ready 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.419
 that's standard today to be simple 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.989
 really the taste a bit too 

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.049
 demand 

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:46.349
 Sugar is a very good one 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.840
 flavor enhancer too 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.770
 of course, he also tastes and tastes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.299
 in this sense accordingly 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.329
 also properly represented but with one 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.020
 percent i would really say is in 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.869
 order 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.289
 Of course, last but not least 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.049
 That's why you should now have three percent 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.890
 here ten seconds this pack resembles 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.489
 cross shot then accordingly 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.090
 do 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.769
 in the microwave when it is not 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.110
 not many was one and a half minutes 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.349
 just spoon in the microwave 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.269
 and the product is ready 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.220
 Let's assume it is living so 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:29.200
 children live with cattle the whole thing 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 it will just do microwave and then 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.239
 I would test it all for you 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.250
 a not yet withheld and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.769
 Although we are the product and ready 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.220
 So it looks rather than shocked 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.970
 his 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.670
 the one only looks like it if it is not 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.060
 true is therefore of consistency once 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.900
 Well, well, do not look like that now 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.829
 can not stand on faith either 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.049
 expect too much 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.420
 I have that in others as well as you 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.459
 we just have to introduce ourselves 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.859
 eyes lead it is a little so that it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.290
 is a finished product which is simply the 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.000
 given that it makes power natural 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.069
 nothing or it is not 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.549
 comparable to a home -cooked one 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.410
 proper food but of course the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.239
 advantage if you travel a lot too 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.970
 not to the one or the other hire 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.359
 to refrain from giving up 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.950
 That's why there is always something to see 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.500
 such mehler sentence really too 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.560
 So test the product for one and a half minutes 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.269
 correspondingly simple at medium level 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.799
 just warmed up and the consistency is already there 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.870
 was so fluid and really I say 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.269
 sometimes edible 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:47.900
 I'll be able to do it all now 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:52.590
 so try rice with beef for a short time 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.170
 yes not bad consequence is synonymous 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.120
 Well 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.820
 turn me on a bit to eat terrain 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.990
 Therefore, the Bundeswehr must be similar 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.990
 be eaten quickly 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.010
 very easy and also from the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.750
 practicality very very simple so 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.280
 something fluid is always easy 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.090
 just to do a bit 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.049
 purchase 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.340
 and already is edible so it looks is 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.400
 acceptable so the product is up 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.730
 eat and then I would say if that 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.720
 one or the other product you want to test 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.330
 then just stop by 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.010
 it will cost just under three euros so in the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.230
 Relationship to expensive as the other 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.940
 tenant set product but I have to be 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.780
 If I have the two products now 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.730
 to advertise 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.610
 I find that much better 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.680
 maybe it's because it's 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.280
 really much easier to eat 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.370
 is just a pack on man has 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.380
 really holds the possibility of great 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.480
 So really , everything also hit me 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.910
 it is not so in the klecker to reach 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.710
 stewed I blow the whole 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.010
 microwave where you can see everything from the sides 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.900
 It can be very stupid charm 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.160
 really easy just leaves that 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.370
 Just to pack a little yes 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.170
 I'll say a little bit of air like that 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.090
 that the air accordingly then 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.670
 can escape so really small 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.740
 opening and otherwise you can stop 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.720
 million everywhere as it really is possible 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.390
 otherwise you can do that accordingly 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.370
 also cold food but were tasty 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.500
 of course a lot better this sense 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.249
 one again commented commented 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.439
 the whole more that one 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:40.799
 a product wanted to experience again 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:45.219
 write in person 

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:46.779
 otherwise me when you look about it 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.399
 sometimes you write the product 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.149
 if necessary already tested or what 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:53.399
 you mean about it 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:53.399
 in this sense, have a nice evening
