00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.700
 paulianer schärding and andreas janke 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.990
 have been posting for three months 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.610
 join the challenge of mobile.de 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 challenge is that they are different from one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.100
 polo worth a maximum of 4,000 euros 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.690
 a porsche act high how far the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.730
 You can then both on the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.820
 follow tempo rama facebook page 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 and support the boys in the search 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 meanwhile the two are at one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 smart forfour arrived 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 but that's nice to them 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.489
 headache prepares to later 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.370
 First, the car went to the processing 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.370
 and was offered from outside and inside 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.390
 But then the repairs were important 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 in the plant and the engine of 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.660
 rear wiper can be repaired and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 That was not all that easy 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.940
 So time the smart forfour on his 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.320
 industry suitability 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.320
 picture 1 engine sound 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:22.580
 to 2 acceleration to 3 of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.580
 Curved water test 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.330
 has become a friend 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 only ever watch what fortunately 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 Want it looks like we have ourselves 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.149
 before laughing made in the pants 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 So everything is fine with the smart 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.250
 forfour is actually for both of us 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 I believe a new situation that we 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.679
 We took care of it with a lot of time 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.729
 We did then when 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.229
 really made it chic and now 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 still standing there and because the two 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.130
 they are really annoying 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.909
 drastic in the middle of the kö in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.909
 Dusseldorf 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.180
 At some point the car has to go away and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.440
 the new ones are paul janisch and andreas 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 at least already in the eye 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.570
 l saw another slk the other day 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.859
 namely the first version because do 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.019
 I like it very much because it's about classic 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.030
 now almost classic yet 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.799
 such a car which is very worthy of discussion 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.209
 and has also been proposed 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.600
 he is by no means 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.520
 because wall street car 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.260
 but swallows too much for that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.540
 small car and I think so very much 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.540
 unreliable I have not read and 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.220
 It was more to watch the first car 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.610
 with which I drove over 200 km / h 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.280
 become 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.050
 in the end it will then be a porsche 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.550
 and of course it will not be kept 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.960
 but among all the over facebook 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.680
 helped 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.680
 loss
