 Attention is the video review 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.360
 project of a two-story house with a total area 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.759
 88 square meters this project home 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.949
 refers to the economy class because 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 total construction cost for 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 square meter will be lower 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.640
 average market order in this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 make sure let's consider together 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.599
 architectural and space planning 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 solutions that are used in this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.710
 the project as you probably already had 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.809
 notice the foundation of the house that is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 the foundation has a rectangular shape with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 attached ringing fencing 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 ground and first floor constructions 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 completely repeat the shape of the foundation in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.219
 house missing balconies bay windows garage 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.980
 terrace 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.480
 all this allows us to maximize 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 reduce the cost of the project with almost no 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 affecting its functionality and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 appearance appeal due to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.879
 original facades of the roof 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
 the building also has no pronounced 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.890
 no frills chaise rays 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.040
 diagonal legs adjoining walls 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.830
 the roof of the building dvukhskatnaya most simple in 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.030
 installation is easy to operate and what 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.409
 the most important alga is the eternal foundation of the house 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 reinforced concrete material exterior and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.130
 internal walls gas silicate block with 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.020
 subsequent warming 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.990
 according to your climate area 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 building flooring 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 performed on wooden beams 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.860
 insulation of the second floor of the rafters 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.470
 finish roofing metal tile 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.240
 the main facade decoration is imitation 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 brickwork with decorative 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 wooden platbands 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.460
 and now let's go into the house and detail 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.189
 consider the internal layout of the entrance to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.500
 the house is carried out through the porch first 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.380
 the room we fall into by entering 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.659
 this vestibule house serves as a better barrier 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 from entering the house of cold air 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.790
 in the winter and the heat in the summer right we see 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.229
 technical room she completely 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.079
 comply with regulatory requirements 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.329
 to accommodate gas or 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.200
 electric heating boiler and 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.600
 other necessary engineering 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.489
 muniatsii further we fall into the hallway 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.470
 here you can remove the outerwear and 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.170
 change clothes left along the corridor 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 we pass into the living room kitchen which 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.230
 accommodates dining table sofa 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.280
 TV sideboard and of course myself 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.920

 carried out through two window openings 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.000
 therefore this room will always be 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.830
 very cozy and desirable for 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.040

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.230
 this is a rational use 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.360
 space-planning decisions 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.240
 allow to fully exploit 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.430

 as a vestibule hall lobby as possible 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.450
