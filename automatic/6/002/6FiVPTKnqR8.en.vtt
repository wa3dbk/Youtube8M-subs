00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
practice you can improve quality if you

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.090

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
step was really to get the buy-in of the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.800

record system in our practice we want to
give<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> reason<00:05:08.950> why<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> we're<00:05:10.420> actually

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
give the reason why so we're actually

to the people that are putting in that
information<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.920> makes<00:05:18.310> adoptions<00:05:19.030> much

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
information it makes adoptions much

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.510 
information it makes adoptions much
easier<00:05:19.660> when<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:20.560> have<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.770> nurse<00:05:21.010> who's<00:05:21.310> been

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
easier when you have a nurse who's been

to kind of try to collect data and we'll

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.770 
to kind of try to collect data and we'll
analyze<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.610> data<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.970> mean<00:05:31.150> that's<00:05:31.270> that's<00:05:31.600> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
analyze the data I mean that's that's a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.510 
analyze the data I mean that's that's a
hole<00:05:31.990> that<00:05:32.290> needs<00:05:32.350> a<00:05:32.680> whole<00:05:32.860> educational

hole that needs a whole educational
process<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.810> me<00:05:34.900> was<00:05:35.080> the<00:05:35.230> biggest

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
process that to me was the biggest

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.920 
process that to me was the biggest
challenge<00:05:36.100> when<00:05:36.460> we<00:05:36.670> went<00:05:36.880> system-wide<00:05:37.540> there

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
challenge when we went system-wide there

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.870 
challenge when we went system-wide there
was<00:05:38.080> more<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:38.380> more<00:05:38.620> resistance<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.700> was

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
was more and more resistance that was

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.760 
was more and more resistance that was
that<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.540> I<00:05:40.570> started<00:05:40.990> identified<00:05:41.560> that<00:05:41.710> I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
that that I started identified that I

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.950 
that that I started identified that I
had<00:05:41.980> to<00:05:42.130> deal<00:05:42.310> with<00:05:42.340> then<00:05:42.820> sometimes<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:43.690> got

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
had to deal with then sometimes you got

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.390 
had to deal with then sometimes you got
to<00:05:44.080> get<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.350> a<00:05:44.380> point<00:05:44.560> where<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.860> had<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.070> make

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
to get to a point where you had to make

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.430 
to get to a point where you had to make
you<00:05:45.670> know<00:05:45.790> a<00:05:45.820> major<00:05:46.120> decision<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.230> hard

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
you know a major decision and the hard

decision and let people go which is

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.420 
decision and let people go which is
something<00:05:49.900> you<00:05:50.290> know<00:05:50.470> nobody<00:05:50.830> likes<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.250> do

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
something you know nobody likes to do
