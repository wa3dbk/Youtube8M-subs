00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
give you the list hmm is the case if

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.430 
give you the list hmm is the case if
it's<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> one-off<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.870> sort<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.410> a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it's a one-off you know sort of like a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.199 
it's a one-off you know sort of like a
single<00:02:46.920> person<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.400> single<00:02:47.730> name<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.090> you've

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
single person a single name that you've

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.020 
single person a single name that you've
band<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.930> they<00:02:49.110> said<00:02:49.350> something

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
band because they said something

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.870 
band because they said something
completely<00:02:51.030> outrageous<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:52.280> guess<00:02:53.280> we'll

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
completely outrageous I guess we'll

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240 
completely outrageous I guess we'll
probably<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.510> end<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.900> happening<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.560> no<00:02:56.070> one

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
probably have end up happening is no one

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.610 
probably have end up happening is no one
would<00:02:56.430> be<00:02:56.820> have<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.300> time<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.810> import<00:02:58.350> their

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
would be have the time to import their

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.830 
would be have the time to import their
this<00:02:58.920> blacklist<00:02:59.489> into<00:02:59.700> their<00:02:59.850> own<00:02:59.970> stuff<00:03:00.360> what

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
this blacklist into their own stuff what

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.180 
this blacklist into their own stuff what
would<00:03:00.959> happen<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.709> had<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> problem

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
would happen is if they had a problem

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.440 
would happen is if they had a problem
with<00:03:02.430> somebody<00:03:02.700> they<00:03:02.820> would<00:03:02.940> check<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.420> if

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
with somebody they would check to see if

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.180 
with somebody they would check to see if
somebody<00:03:03.780> else<00:03:04.019> had<00:03:04.200> already<00:03:04.320> added<00:03:04.860> them<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
somebody else had already added them to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.430 
somebody else had already added them to
the<00:03:05.220> list<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.750> doesn't<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.140> do

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the list and that but doesn't really do

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.800 
the list and that but doesn't really do
anything<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:08.130> you've<00:03:08.250> already

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
anything because then you've already

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.699 
anything because then you've already
blacklisted<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> person<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.260> your<00:03:10.290> own<00:03:10.500> thing

just<00:03:23.910> universally<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> douche<00:03:25.350> then<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.250> can

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
just universally a douche then you can

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.720 
just universally a douche then you can
you<00:03:26.940> let<00:03:27.120> everybody<00:03:27.390> know<00:03:27.630> that<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:29.250> makes

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
you let everybody know that and it makes

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.940 
you let everybody know that and it makes
it<00:03:29.880> harder<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.209> them<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.810> places<00:03:31.079> even<00:03:31.829> if

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it harder for them to be places even if

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.580 
it harder for them to be places even if
they<00:03:32.070> change<00:03:32.310> names<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.420> tend<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> recognize

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
they change names you tend to recognize

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
well it looks like this is the sort of

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.550 
well it looks like this is the sort of
thing<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:19.079> necessarily<00:04:19.229> even

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
thing that we don't necessarily even

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.850 
thing that we don't necessarily even
need<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.220> vote<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:20.970> because<00:04:21.479> we're<00:04:21.660> not<00:04:21.860> doing

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
need to vote on because we're not doing

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.630 
need to vote on because we're not doing
anything<00:04:23.330> or<00:04:24.530> mm<00:04:25.530> oh<00:04:25.710> really<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.370> mean<00:04:26.490> it's

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
anything or mm oh really I mean it's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.500 
anything or mm oh really I mean it's
just<00:04:26.700> date<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.090> know<00:04:27.120> it

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
just date you know it

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.440 
just date you know it
just<00:04:27.920> that's<00:04:28.920> more<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.370> yeah<00:04:29.730> if<00:04:29.940> somebody

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
just that's more of a yeah if somebody

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.720 
just that's more of a yeah if somebody
says<00:04:30.690> something<00:04:30.720> incredibly<00:04:31.530> egregious<00:04:32.130> you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
says something incredibly egregious you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.130 
says something incredibly egregious you
will<00:04:32.970> probably<00:04:33.180> tell<00:04:33.480> each<00:04:33.630> other<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:34.020> it

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
will probably tell each other but it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.520 
will probably tell each other but it
doesn't<00:04:34.320> really<00:04:34.410> need<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.770> formal<00:04:35.250> thing

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
doesn't really need to be a formal thing

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.510 
doesn't really need to be a formal thing
okay<00:04:37.530> well<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.740> won't<00:04:37.950> bring<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.160> up<00:04:38.280> just

the week on them this is exactly the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.840 
the week on them this is exactly the
sort<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.680> stuff<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:43.950> should<00:04:44.190> be<00:04:44.340> talking<00:04:44.550> about

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
maybe we don't vote on it not because

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.290 
maybe we don't vote on it not because
it's<00:04:49.620> not<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> good<00:04:50.040> idea<00:04:50.100> but<00:04:50.430> because<00:04:50.700> we<00:04:51.120> need

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
it's not a good idea but because we need

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.790 
it's not a good idea but because we need
