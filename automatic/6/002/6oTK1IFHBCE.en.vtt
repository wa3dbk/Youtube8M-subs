00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.769
 let's draw a hexagon a polygon 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.589
 of 7 sides 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:10.769
 inscribed in a circle for it 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.130
 The first thing we will do is draw two 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.130
 perpendicular diameters 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.130
 we are dealing with the horizontal diameter 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.970
 and perpendicular to this we will trace 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.970
 410 meters 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.750
 now with the measurement of the radius 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 and clicking on one of the ends of the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.770
 horizontal diameter 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 we will draw a bow that will help us 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 find the half bar of the radius 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.030
 we have two cut points with the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.510
 initial circumference we join the two 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.940
 cutting points 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.250
 and we have the half-triangle of the radius that 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 gives us 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.930
 a cutoff point like the radius if 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.060
 we take from that measure 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.990
 from the cutoff point with the radius 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 until 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.010
 until the arch with which we have cut 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.350
 the circumference 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.540
 we have the measure on the side of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.440
 rectangle the measure we were 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.510
 searching 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 with that measure we will draw arcs that 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.440
 cut the circumference 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.040
 and we will divide 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.430
 the circumference of seven parts 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.430
 same 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.080
 once this is done we will only have 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.119
 that go joining those cut points of 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
 the arcs with the circumference for 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.610
 have the hexagon inscribed in the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 circumference
