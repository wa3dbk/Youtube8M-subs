 it is a nightmare for the inhabitants of a border region otherwise 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.590
 estimated more of the neighboring country can rescue one in an emergency 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.580
 Human life companions we have repeatedly reported about it 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.979
 Since last year, there is an agreement between Germany and France 

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:23.939
 that should facilitate the cross-border emergency response and now 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 there are positive news for the first time Barbara Spitzer reports like the little one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.839
 Johnny was rescued from Bach and questioned whether it really everything 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.839
 went smoothly 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.380
 the contingency plans 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.560
 a house fire in the middle of the city 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.150
 two children and their parents can save themselves 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.680
 but the two year old to be 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.040
 he is fetched from the rubble by the fire department 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.110
 unconscious and with severe burns 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 she comes to the hospital after a preliminary report 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.220
 children's ward 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220
 who wins Germany from the five young Werther 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.840
 Gert Böhm up to 2 TByte the titles when he was the little girl's skin too 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.190
 50 percent burned that means mortal danger and every one counts 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.090
 minute 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.700
 For this 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.620
 controversial with Blue Coat rental 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.390
 while two explanations either fight for the girl's life 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.020
 seeks to educate another with the help of the French command center in CET 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.150
 after a special clinic Vienna is open the trigger Pankow 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.840
 we lost when we tried 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.609
 to find a bed for the girl because all the specialty clinics in France 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.359
 with Canal are Strasbourg - the university has been assigned 'um 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.450
 advise there 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 homemade because the men attacks the German anesthesiologist Oberwart 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 the accidentally Tuesday the initiative Euro 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.370
 at Lemme action room no foreign line has reputation from the gate 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 the rescue center on the Saarbrücken Winterberg 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.420
 Hirschmann always countries Pocher Kerner was a fresh 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.970
 create 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.340
 The employees find quickly as free space in Mannheim 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.700
 Why does the helicopter in Africa not have to defend the air transport? 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.689
 Next stop is Christoph 16 in Saarbrücken 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.159
 but also here are the control center because it is about a transfer flight 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.159
 not a rescue at the scene of the accident 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.709
 the Christoph 16 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.719
 has the first care of complaining injured and diseased but 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.780
 It would then have been unavailable for two to three hours 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.069
 you have to distract the area 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.249
 and of course rather and time of day has neither hamlet 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.589
 Peters 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.439
 Roche also played a role here, that it went into the night 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.789
 also outside laying thrust Schropp place better equipped to safer 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.419
 a Carry out laying there 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.059
 and the next of this increase in Luxembourg ready the contract of the 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.099
 control center 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.639
 Half an hour later, the Luxembourg helicopter arrives 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.309
 one is the computer science against 17 30 from 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.119
 three hours after the fire at her home 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.119
 a case of smooth cross-border cooperation 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.079
 So I think that the actual race is an example of how percent 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.239
 it worked well the faithful Leander production Burg France Germany 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.659
 to stream their rescue streamed the bes 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.650
 speedy and that may not be understandable to the layman but there 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.369
 is fast within one to two hours 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.779
 Percent has come to this laying 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.349
 a few weeks ago 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.069
 at the rescue center in march in tender Rüttgers one concedes that is 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.329
 A stroke of luck was that a German doctor speaks French service 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.139
 otherwise, would have been the relocation of the small because of the language barrier 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.349
 probably took even longer 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.569
 is replaced Toprak 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.620
 The staff here can do mankind German but they do 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.900
 very difficult as well as the German easier casual with the French 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.769
 hard is already doing something 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.509
 another hook 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.409
 still not all lifeboats from Lorraine are likely to be 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.179
 Germany fly some windows are missing now 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.749
 A big help would be a cross-border control center 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.889
 is future music 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.459
 the Hauptwerk come 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.739
 a common control center is not unrealistic but I think that would have 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.449
 I long ago retired on the stage the problem is that the competences 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.360
 are not the same, there are different procedures around her than AZ 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.069
 Advisor on the control center there is no picnic in Germany 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.069
 there through the rock into the distance 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.619
 Panther II is in good hands at the University Hospital in Mannheim 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:38.509
 parents 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.559
 need to 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.800
 that this kind of trinational rescue 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 In future Una happy coincidences will be possible 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.189
 of course we will continue to observe this 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.240
 Do you know where the word sabotage comes from? 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.430
 it probably originated during the Industrial Revolution
