00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
probably gonna get destroyed in this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.390 
probably gonna get destroyed in this
because<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.530> no<00:01:16.799> saving<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
because there's just really no saving it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
because there's just really no saving it
to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.670> honest<00:01:17.970> um<00:01:18.180> although<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> lot

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to be honest um although it is a lot

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
to be honest um although it is a lot
sturdier<00:01:19.740> than<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.400> normal<00:01:20.610> missions<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> think

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
sturdier than in normal missions I think

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.719 
sturdier than in normal missions I think
they<00:01:21.479> doubled<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> insurance<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.369> take

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
they doubled the insurance they can take

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
they doubled the insurance they can take
in<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.090> mission<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
in this mission for one right now but

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.140 
in this mission for one right now but
the<00:01:25.740> main<00:01:25.890> thing<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.430> need<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the main thing is you need to do is to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
the main thing is you need to do is to
defend<00:01:27.420> both<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> those<00:01:28.080> stacking<00:01:28.619> pads<00:01:28.829> over

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
defend both of those stacking pads over

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
defend both of those stacking pads over
there<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.759> those<00:01:29.909> blow<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
there because of those blow up then you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.480 
there because of those blow up then you
don't<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> complete<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> mission<00:01:32.369> one

you<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:06.049> won't<00:03:06.170> run<00:03:06.739> out<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.220> ammo<00:03:07.580> or

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
you really won't run out of like ammo or

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.550 
you really won't run out of like ammo or
anything<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.299> that's<00:03:08.360> good<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.959> don't<00:03:09.500> know

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
anything so that's good I don't know

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.750 
anything so that's good I don't know
what<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.799> is<00:03:09.890> that's<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.070> fireball<00:03:10.489> okay

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
what that is that's a fireball okay

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.490 
what that is that's a fireball okay
right<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.330> almost<00:03:11.870> half<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.140> your<00:03:12.260> commission

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
right so almost half of your commission

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.350 
right so almost half of your commission
now<00:03:13.930> alright<00:03:15.100> here<00:03:16.100> comes<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.640> time<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.239> just

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
now alright here comes a time to just

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.900 
now alright here comes a time to just
make<00:03:17.630> sure<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.989> defend<00:03:18.380> those<00:03:18.769> two<00:03:19.220> stacking

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
make sure you defend those two stacking

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.090 
make sure you defend those two stacking
these<00:03:20.540> two<00:03:20.810> fizzy<00:03:21.290> pop<00:03:21.560> bread<00:03:21.830> wherever

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
these two fizzy pop bread wherever

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.630 
these two fizzy pop bread wherever
they're<00:03:22.250> called

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
they're called

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400 
they're called
just<00:03:22.820> defend<00:03:23.299> those<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.140> pretty

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
just defend those because it's pretty

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.050 
just defend those because it's pretty
essential<00:03:24.799> but<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.250> can<00:03:25.430> destroy<00:03:25.730> their<00:03:25.910> base

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
essential but I can destroy their base

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.550 
essential but I can destroy their base
now<00:03:26.299> if<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.510> want<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.780> use<00:03:26.930> I'm<00:03:27.049> going<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.290> go<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
now if I want to use I'm going to go and

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.199 
now if I want to use I'm going to go and
try<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:27.920> now<00:03:28.100> probably<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.880> bit<00:03:29.000> risky

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
try that now probably a bit risky

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.770 
try that now probably a bit risky
admittedly<00:03:29.870> what<00:03:30.170> I'm<00:03:30.260> gonna<00:03:30.380> do<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.739> see

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
admittedly what I'm gonna do I see

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.840 
admittedly what I'm gonna do I see
destroy<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.350> knowledge<00:03:32.770> base<00:03:33.010> please<00:03:33.280> raise

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
destroy the knowledge base please raise

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.990 
destroy the knowledge base please raise
it<00:03:34.770> all<00:03:35.770> right<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:35.980> we<00:03:36.040> can<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.280> him<00:03:36.460> to<00:03:36.490> bomb

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
it all right so we can get him to bomb

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.400 
it all right so we can get him to bomb
his<00:03:37.150> own<00:03:37.300> face<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.750> won't<00:03:37.900> be<00:03:37.960> good<00:03:38.050> but

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
his own face and that won't be good but

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.960 
his own face and that won't be good but
is<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.680> quite<00:03:39.010> risky<00:03:39.250> doing<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.820> because

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
is it quite risky doing this because

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.730 
is it quite risky doing this because
then<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.240> let<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.510> blue<00:03:40.690> team<00:03:41.050> have<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
then you let the blue team have the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.860 
then you let the blue team have the
opportunity<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.340> destroy<00:03:42.490> your<00:03:42.880> base<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.690> yeah

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
opportunity to destroy your base so yeah

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.900 
opportunity to destroy your base so yeah
probably<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> good<00:03:44.890> idea<00:03:45.070> don't<00:03:45.670> listen

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
probably not a good idea don't listen

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.330 
probably not a good idea don't listen
I'm<00:03:46.270> gonna<00:03:46.420> run<00:03:46.900> away<00:03:47.020> now<00:03:47.140> because<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.830> managed

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
I'm gonna run away now because I managed

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.920 
I'm gonna run away now because I managed
to<00:03:48.400> destroy<00:03:48.760> half<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.420> many<00:03:49.540> billion<00:03:49.810> come

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
to destroy half it so many billion come

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.070 
to destroy half it so many billion come
return<00:03:50.230> later<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:51.280> yeah<00:03:51.520> locally<00:03:52.450> are<00:03:52.750> I'm

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
return later but yeah locally are I'm

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.300 
return later but yeah locally are I'm
actually<00:03:53.290> doing<00:03:53.530> quite<00:03:53.800> well<00:03:53.920> in<00:03:54.100> this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
actually doing quite well in this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.540 
actually doing quite well in this
mission<00:03:54.520> surprisingly<00:03:55.300> but<00:03:55.900> yeah<00:03:56.080> okay<00:03:56.550> just

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
mission surprisingly but yeah okay just

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.199 
mission surprisingly but yeah okay just
this<00:03:57.940> here<00:03:58.740> quickly<00:03:59.740> try<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> make<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.550> 8<00:04:01.150> pack

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
this here quickly try to make a 8 pack

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.020 
this here quickly try to make a 8 pack
of<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:02.020> one<00:04:02.560> here<00:04:05.190> there<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.250> go<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:07.000> very

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
of this one here there we go it's very

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.520 
of this one here there we go it's very
hard<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.420> maneuver<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.020> body<00:04:08.230> into<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
hard to maneuver the body into the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.010 
hard to maneuver the body into the
position<00:04:09.130> there<00:04:09.550> we<00:04:09.700> go<00:04:09.850> America<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.570> super

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
position there we go America the super

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.100 
position there we go America the super
version<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.500> super<00:04:11.950> 4<00:04:12.130> pack<00:04:12.340> rockets<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.110> this

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
version the super 4 pack rockets so this

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.159 
version the super 4 pack rockets so this
is<00:04:14.580> very<00:04:15.580> very<00:04:15.820> good<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.780> will<00:04:16.900> definitely

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
is very very good so it will definitely

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.020 
is very very good so it will definitely
help<00:04:17.500> them<00:04:17.650> destroying<00:04:18.070> these<00:04:18.220> side<00:04:18.519> Wars<00:04:18.820> as

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
help them destroying these side Wars as

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.180 
help them destroying these side Wars as
you<00:04:19.120> can<00:04:19.239> see<00:04:19.480> are<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.230> running<00:04:20.470> a<00:04:20.590> health<00:04:20.859> but

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
you can see are you running a health but

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.770 
you can see are you running a health but
hopefully<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.519> should<00:04:21.730> not<00:04:22.000> design<00:04:22.330> because

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
hopefully I should not design because

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240 
hopefully I should not design because
I'm<00:04:22.870> doing<00:04:23.080> really<00:04:23.290> well<00:04:23.410> in<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:23.860> mission<00:04:24.070> I

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
I'm doing really well in this mission I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.580 
I'm doing really well in this mission I
don't<00:04:24.490> want<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.790> fail<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:25.870> health<00:04:26.140> very

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
don't want to fail I just health very

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.770 
don't want to fail I just health very
much<00:04:26.770> okay<00:04:27.280> now<00:04:27.460> straight<00:04:27.790> aside<00:04:28.240> work<00:04:28.480> side

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
much okay now straight aside work side

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.630 
much okay now straight aside work side
wars<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.140> very<00:04:29.320> slow<00:04:29.680> locally<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.460> makes

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
wars are very slow locally so that makes

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.800 
wars are very slow locally so that makes
it<00:04:30.790> easy<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.180> shoot<00:04:31.360> them<00:04:31.600> when<00:04:31.720> they're

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
it easy to shoot them when they're

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.150 
it easy to shoot them when they're
trying<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.050> run<00:04:32.140> away<00:04:32.290> from<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.680> as<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.980> see

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
trying to run away from you as you see

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.180 
trying to run away from you as you see
here<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:34.090> yes<00:04:34.570> I'm<00:04:34.900> talking<00:04:35.320> about<00:04:35.530> why<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.830> am

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
here one yes I'm talking about why I am

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.190 
here one yes I'm talking about why I am
on<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> roll<00:04:36.760> in<00:04:37.090> terms<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.479> not<00:04:37.630> failing<00:04:38.080> on

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
on a roll in terms of not failing on

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.810 
on a roll in terms of not failing on
missions<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:38.770> probably<00:04:39.070> gonna<00:04:39.250> jinx<00:04:39.580> myself

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
missions I'm probably gonna jinx myself

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.530 
missions I'm probably gonna jinx myself
I<00:04:40.419> best<00:04:40.960> push<00:04:41.290> oh<00:04:41.560> well<00:04:41.740> maybe<00:04:42.669> not<00:04:42.880> maybe<00:04:43.180> I'm
