00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello and welcome!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for another unboxing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's my 100th video

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
like the title says, it's going to be epic

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I want this for a long time and finally I got it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I  hope it looks better in real than on the pictures

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
ok let's unbox it!!!!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I am so curious

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the first item is AvP and comes with a very cool slipcover

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
PREDATOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
AWESOME!!!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
ok here's the Predator Head....obviously

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
on the right side is the movie AvP 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the Head is manufactured by WETA

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and has the size 35cm high x 30cm wide

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the Head weighs 2.3 Kg

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but he is very lightweight

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I think it's made of some kind of plastic

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but the Head looks so awesome!!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you have to see this in real life

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it looks so cool!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
ok, let's take a look at the movie

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it's the unrated edition

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it's very glossy and everything is embossed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
very cool

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
side

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the lettering is embossed

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
backside

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
everything is written in japanese

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
other side

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
looks the same

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
both have the same front-cover

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
as well as the back-cover

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
one disc - the movie

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:05.000
here's a comic for AvP

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and some flyer all in japanese

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
ok here's the Predator

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I would say we measure again 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
about 34cm - 35cm      

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the wide is about 30cm

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
without the shoulders maybe a little bit smaller

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But actually, it doesn't matter

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
here's the side

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
it just looks so awesome

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
everything is from one piece

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
nothing is processed individually

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's just one big piece

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
backside

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think thas very cool

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you open it up

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
behind there's the digistack

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the side

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Predator - The ultimate dvd collection

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
backside

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
there is space for Predator 1 2 and Alien vs Predator

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but it's unfortunately empty

00:04:47.000 --> 00:05:04.000
you have to put the movies inside the digistack

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the other side

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
here's the top of the head

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it looks very cool

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
ok let's take a closer look

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
here are the laser visor

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
you know what I mean

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
here's the neck

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I think it's plastic, but it's feel like plasterboard, it's hard to tell

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
here are some weird symbols

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
here's the back

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
here are also some weird symbols

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:46.000
they are embossed

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:56.000
other side

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
here are also some weird symbols

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I have no clue what that means

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it just looks awesome

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.800
ok that's it, I hope you liked it and see you next time!!
