00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
let's get started on the technique the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.120 
let's get started on the technique the
first<00:00:35.170> thing<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.350> need<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.530> know<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:36.040> a

on the second octave of the guitar so

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.729 
on the second octave of the guitar so
the<00:00:40.750> way<00:00:40.840> this<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.140> done<00:00:41.320> is<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.500> take<00:00:41.620> our

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.699 
and that's the crescendo okay so to get
that<00:02:32.310> very<00:02:32.490> aggressive<00:02:33.030> sound<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.600> find<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
that very aggressive sound I find it

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.440 
that very aggressive sound I find it
helps<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.070> deflect<00:02:35.490> back<00:02:35.880> from<00:02:36.150> chord<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
helps to deflect back from chord to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.280 
helps to deflect back from chord to
chord<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.050> I'll<00:02:37.290> play<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> e7

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.900 

could<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.069> short<00:02:41.310> diminish

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
could you short diminish

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.540 
could you short diminish
back<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.690> thee

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.760 

back<00:02:49.510> again<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.960> g-sharp<00:02:50.380> then<00:02:50.590> I'll<00:02:50.680> go

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
back again to the g-sharp then I'll go

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.840 
back again to the g-sharp then I'll go
up<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
up to the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.000 
up to the
be<00:02:53.390> diminished<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:56.860> finally<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
be diminished and finally to the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:07.720 
be diminished and finally to the
crescendo<00:02:58.220> should<00:02:58.670> sound<00:02:58.820> like<00:02:58.880> this<00:03:06.490> G<00:03:07.490> sharp

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
crescendo should sound like this G sharp

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.210 
crescendo should sound like this G sharp
diminished<00:03:07.880> 7<00:03:09.610> G<00:03:10.610> sharp<00:03:10.820> diminished<00:03:12.220> B

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
diminished 7 G sharp diminished B

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:35.920 
diminished 7 G sharp diminished B
diminished<00:03:13.630> G<00:03:14.630> sharp<00:03:14.810> diminished<00:03:15.430> B<00:03:16.430> again

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.089 

all<00:03:36.930> right<00:03:37.079> once<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.290> got<00:03:37.439> those<00:03:37.530> chord<00:03:37.829> forms

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
all right once you got those chord forms

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.860 
all right once you got those chord forms
down<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.579> you're<00:03:38.700> comfortable<00:03:39.209> switching

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
down and you're comfortable switching

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.020 
down and you're comfortable switching
from<00:03:40.079> from<00:03:40.590> shape<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.950> shape<00:03:41.129> let's<00:03:41.849> take<00:03:42.000> a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
from from shape to shape let's take a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
from from shape to shape let's take a
look<00:03:42.239> at<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.870> right<00:03:43.019> hand<00:03:43.200> technique

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
look at the the right hand technique

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.720 
look at the the right hand technique
alright<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:44.189> let's<00:03:44.310> take<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> look<00:03:44.549> at<00:03:44.670> the

alright so let's take a look at the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.069 
alright so let's take a look at the
right<00:03:44.879> hand<00:03:45.000> technique<00:03:45.420> being<00:03:45.659> played<00:03:45.900> over

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
right hand technique being played over

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.160 
right hand technique being played over
top<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.500> seven

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610
