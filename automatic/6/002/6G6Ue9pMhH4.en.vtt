advance guide series I originally did
plan<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> do<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.440> attacker<00:00:07.740> video<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.880> but<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
plan to do the attacker video now but I

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.330 
plan to do the attacker video now but I
fall<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.900> do<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.290> Queen<00:00:10.500> before<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> go<00:00:11.040> into<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
fall I do the Queen before I go into the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
fall I do the Queen before I go into the
roles<00:00:11.550> as<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.570> Queen<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.440> know

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
roles as the Queen you have to know

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.259 
roles as the Queen you have to know
whichever<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.280> doing<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:14.910> probably

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
whichever really doing and it's probably

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.529 
whichever really doing and it's probably
more<00:00:15.719> important<00:00:16.430> really<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:17.730> if<00:00:18.029> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
more important really because if you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.730 
more important really because if you
don't<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> trick<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
don't know how to do the trick for the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
don't know how to do the trick for the
Queen<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.300> last<00:00:21.420> wave<00:00:21.630> take<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
Queen it will make the last wave take a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130 
Queen it will make the last wave take a
while<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.980> worth<00:00:23.189> doing<00:00:23.430> really<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.750> I'll

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
while and not worth doing really so I'll

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.130 
while and not worth doing really so I'll
explain<00:00:25.500> how<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> Queen<00:00:26.869> how<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> do

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
explain how to do the Queen how to do

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
explain how to do the Queen how to do
each<00:00:28.289> rule<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.119> obviously<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.330> little

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
each rule and obviously this little

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.759 
each rule and obviously this little
trick<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:31.140> sure<00:00:31.289> i'm<00:00:31.380> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> show<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
trick we're sure i'm going to show you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.549 
trick we're sure i'm going to show you
everything<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.309> clip<00:00:32.610> soon<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.260> i<00:00:34.380> show

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
everything and clip soon so if i show

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
everything and clip soon so if i show
you<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:35.820> cycle<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.420> how<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you this the little cycle of how it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
you this the little cycle of how it
works<00:00:37.070> right<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> Queen<00:00:39.390> spawns

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
works right so when the Queen spawns

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
works right so when the Queen spawns
it'll<00:00:40.200> come<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.469> through<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> trap<00:00:40.950> doors<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it'll come up through the trap doors on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
it'll come up through the trap doors on
the<00:00:41.370> ground<00:00:41.690> hopefully<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:43.079> everything

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the ground hopefully by then everything

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
the ground hopefully by then everything
will<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.950> done<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> wave<00:00:44.820> itself<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
will be done in the wave itself in the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.229 
will be done in the wave itself in the
wave<00:00:46.050> itself<00:00:46.200> Italy<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.579> any<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> our<00:00:48.030> wave

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
wave itself Italy is at any of our wave

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
wave itself Italy is at any of our wave
is<00:00:48.510> slightly<00:00:49.020> easier<00:00:49.320> than<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> earlier

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
is slightly easier than the earlier

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
is slightly easier than the earlier
waves<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:51.090> about<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> similar<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:51.870> we're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
waves it's about a similar well we're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
waves it's about a similar well we're
six<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:53.129> everyone<00:00:53.340> kills<00:00:53.640> everything<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
six but everyone kills everything and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
six but everyone kills everything and
the<00:00:54.960> Queen<00:00:55.140> sports<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> timer<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.340> after

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the Queen sports on a timer not after

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119 
the Queen sports on a timer not after
everything's<00:00:57.120> killed<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.010> kill

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
everything's killed so if you don't kill

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
everything's killed so if you don't kill
anything<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> Queen<00:00:59.789> will<00:01:00.030> spawn<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> you'll

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
anything the Queen will spawn and you'll

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
anything the Queen will spawn and you'll
have<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> lot<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.079> work<00:01:01.289> started<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
have a lot of work started it so you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.290 
have a lot of work started it so you
want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.640> you've<00:01:02.910> done<00:01:02.940> everything

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
want to make sure you've done everything

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.820 
want to make sure you've done everything
and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.320> taking<00:01:04.530> extra

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and you don't want to be taking extra

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
and you don't want to be taking extra
damage<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> healer<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.530> overrun

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
damage because the healer can be overrun

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
damage because the healer can be overrun
at<00:01:08.070> times<00:01:08.250> especially<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.180> level

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
at times especially if it's not level

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719 
at times especially if it's not level
five<00:01:09.630> healer<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> Queen's<00:01:11.490> pawn

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
five healer so when the Queen's pawn

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.499 
five healer so when the Queen's pawn
will<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.030> exporting<00:01:12.869> around<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> around<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
will be exporting around the around the

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.140 
will be exporting around the around the
arena<00:01:15.509> yet<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.590> yellow<00:01:16.950> eggs<00:01:17.159> well<00:01:17.850> not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
arena yet little yellow eggs well not

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
arena yet little yellow eggs well not
little<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> bigger<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> other<00:01:19.049> X<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
little the bigger than the other X and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.280 
little the bigger than the other X and
so<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> collector<00:01:20.909> picks<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.540> many<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so the collector picks up as many of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
so the collector picks up as many of
them<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:22.890> need<00:01:23.100> obviously<00:01:23.640> with

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
them as you're gonna need obviously with

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.480 
them as you're gonna need obviously with
the<00:01:23.790> trick<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> pick<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.490> without

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the trick you want to pick up to without

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
the trick you want to pick up to without
the<00:01:26.640> trick<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.330> eight<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> he

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the trick you want to do eight so he

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
the trick you want to do eight so he
picks<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.579> eggs<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.140> to

pass them to the healing will appear in

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
pass them to the healing will appear in

and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.360> he<00:01:48.840> passes<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.409> attack<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.770> by

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and then he passes them to attack out by

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
and then he passes them to attack out by
the<00:01:49.950> same<00:01:50.189> method<00:01:50.490> used<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> using<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.240> on

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the same method used to using them on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the attacker by now the attacker should

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
the attacker by now the attacker should
have<00:01:54.420> went<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> little<00:01:55.799> poison<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.399> the

have went to the little poison them the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.100 
have went to the little poison them the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
little spiky mushrooms around the cave

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.399 
little spiky mushrooms around the cave
that<00:01:58.350> only<00:01:58.829> appear<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> weekend<00:01:59.960> he<00:02:00.960> picks<00:02:01.229> as

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that only appear in weekend he picks as

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.350 
that only appear in weekend he picks as
many<00:02:01.950> strikes<00:02:02.219> isn't<00:02:02.490> gonna<00:02:02.579> need<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.030> uses

many strikes isn't gonna need and uses

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109 
many strikes isn't gonna need and uses
one<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.810> each<00:02:03.930> egg<00:02:04.310> they<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.670> were<00:02:05.850> there

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
one on each egg they these were there

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.040 
one on each egg they these were there
will<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.270> spiked<00:02:06.659> poisoned<00:02:07.200> eggs

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
will be spiked poisoned eggs

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.900 
will be spiked poisoned eggs
then<00:02:08.350> he<00:02:08.620> passes<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.040> defender<00:02:09.490> again<00:02:09.760> by

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
then he passes the defender again by

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.090 
then he passes the defender again by
using<00:02:10.180> them<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.510> him<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.500> defender<00:02:11.890> dips

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
using them on him and the defender dips

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.610 
using them on him and the defender dips
them<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.430> pool<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> lava<00:02:12.940> all<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.900> them<00:02:14.050> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
them in a pool of lava all of them and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.650 
them in a pool of lava all of them and
now<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.860> by<00:02:15.010> Omega<00:02:15.340> regs<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.300> he<00:02:16.420> should<00:02:16.540> have

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
now you by Omega regs so he should have

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140 
now you by Omega regs so he should have
280<00:02:17.110> mega<00:02:17.470> regs<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:18.280> he<00:02:18.520> passes<00:02:18.820> them<00:02:18.940> back

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
280 mega regs then he passes them back

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.940 
280 mega regs then he passes them back
to<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> collector<00:02:19.870> he's<00:02:20.470> got<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> little

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
to the collector he's got a little

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.740 
to the collector he's got a little
diamond<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.400> machine<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.390> he<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.600> why<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
diamond in the machine but he is why the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.250 
diamond in the machine but he is why the
trick<00:02:23.020> comes<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:25.080> generally<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> takes

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
trick comes in so generally it takes

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.900 
trick comes in so generally it takes
eight<00:02:26.620> eggs<00:02:26.830> because<00:02:27.070> each<00:02:27.310> egg<00:02:27.520> can<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.760> up<00:02:27.880> to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
eight eggs because each egg can do up to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.690 
eight eggs because each egg can do up to
about<00:02:28.120> 400<00:02:28.630> damage<00:02:28.930> marks<00:02:29.460> approximately<00:02:30.460> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
about 400 damage marks approximately and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.330 
about 400 damage marks approximately and
the<00:02:31.270> Queen's<00:02:31.480> got<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.900> lot<00:02:32.350> more<00:02:32.380> HP<00:02:32.770> than<00:02:32.980> that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
the Queen's got a lot more HP than that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.600 
the Queen's got a lot more HP than that
so<00:02:34.240> what<00:02:35.170> everyone<00:02:35.860> does<00:02:36.100> when<00:02:36.490> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
so what everyone does when the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.450 
so what everyone does when the
collectors<00:02:36.940> got<00:02:37.120> both<00:02:37.300> eggs<00:02:38.130> everyone<00:02:39.130> clicks

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
collectors got both eggs everyone clicks

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.090 
collectors got both eggs everyone clicks
on<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.030> egg<00:02:40.180> launcher<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.810> clicks<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.530> 0

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
on the egg launcher and clicks on 0

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.520 
on the egg launcher and clicks on 0
Omega<00:02:42.460> eggs<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.970> spam<00:02:43.270> click<00:02:43.540> set<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.500> that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
Omega eggs and spam click set so that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.710 
Omega eggs and spam click set so that
little<00:02:45.010> fire<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.460> egg<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.910> soon<00:02:46.240> as<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> comes

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
little fire the egg as soon as it comes

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.130 
little fire the egg as soon as it comes
into<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> machine<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.960> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
into the machine so this this is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.900 
into the machine so this this is
obviously<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.560> problem<00:02:50.740> for<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> game<00:02:51.550> because

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
obviously a problem for the game because

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.760 
obviously a problem for the game because
there's<00:02:52.600> four<00:02:52.840> people<00:02:53.080> clicking<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.440> at<00:02:53.560> once

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
there's four people clicking it at once

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.640 
there's four people clicking it at once
instead<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.520> on<00:02:54.640> pit<00:02:55.140> which<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.350> player

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
instead of going on pit which is player

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.860 
instead of going on pit which is player
I<00:02:56.710> day<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.580> determine<00:02:58.000> which<00:02:58.120> he<00:02:58.420> finds<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
I day to determine which he finds the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.050 
I day to determine which he finds the
egg<00:02:58.990> everyone<00:02:59.710> finds<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> egg<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.670> what<00:03:00.910> egg

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
egg everyone finds the egg so what egg

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
egg everyone finds the egg so what egg
goes<00:03:01.240> down<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.480> machine<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.590> Peter<00:03:02.800> fire

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
goes down the machine and for Peter fire

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.550 
goes down the machine and for Peter fire
it<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.360> just<00:03:04.540> four<00:03:04.810> times<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.200> damage<00:03:05.410> for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it so in just four times the damage for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.290 
it so in just four times the damage for
one<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.460> why<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.640> only<00:03:06.850> need<00:03:07.090> two

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
one it this is why you only need two

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.610 
one it this is why you only need two
maps<00:03:07.570> because<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.020> normally<00:03:08.290> takes<00:03:08.470> eight

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
maps because it normally takes eight

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.610 
maps because it normally takes eight
marks<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:11.170> collector

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
marks to do it so the collector

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.260 
marks to do it so the collector
obviously<00:03:11.980> has<00:03:12.100> 2x<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.700> generally<00:03:13.120> when<00:03:13.239> you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
obviously has 2x and generally when you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.420 
obviously has 2x and generally when you
click<00:03:13.480> load<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:14.110> an<00:03:14.290> egg<00:03:14.440> it'll<00:03:14.950> fire<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> bull

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
click load on an egg it'll fire a bull

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.910 
click load on an egg it'll fire a bull
for<00:03:15.580> them<00:03:15.730> LM<00:03:16.300> sorry<00:03:17.020> i'll<00:03:17.230> put<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.530> bowl<00:03:17.739> for
