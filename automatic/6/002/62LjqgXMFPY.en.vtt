00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.610
 and the one of which is at the point a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.599
 new presentation rather how 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.109
 to do in his cell phone so he's us 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 need of computer speakers to oxen 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.779
 or no computer but as long as it's not 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.210
 Too big and his Ark by usb 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.250
 after that we will have to call ourselves coach 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 be schoolchildren first of schoolchildren am 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 it is more efficient we will say the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.290
 faÃ§ade is better than scotchs 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 after that you will need a clock well 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 but it is not obligatory but it is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 better so here's so after and I'm going 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 to show you that it works so there 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.879
 will also need a battery and their 12 cases 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.149
 donald 1.5 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.280
 So here is the show that there is no 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.079
 tricky when you see the leash well 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 go in there and it pleases him 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.989
 only son that history connect them to my 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.989
 phone 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.380
 so that's it works the senses I am and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 rock 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.450
 so it's deny my iphone is no 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.670
 seat 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.040
 I will show you how it works 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 and how then do you need to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.619
 have a stack of 4.80 and 5 as I wanted 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.570
 said we must have just spoken usb 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.850
 so the c1 jack 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.610
 it flies to plug into your mp3 phone 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 mp4 after that is the son of the usb so 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 me in my case the usb it's in front 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 and cables like that it's not in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.530
 a round sheath 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 so it's easy for mules so 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.740
 here wait so here gives you a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 idea 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 Ben you dismount the thread after the pile 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.650
 there the thread you put on the most is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.870
 on the mans the two bars 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.300
 finally and 2 land what and if it works 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.330
 not you reverse the rogues was the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.250
 sons who were there and cops were there 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.280
 here so that's it should work after 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.760
 have launched jack and by the fact that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.590
 it fits on your speakers me 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 I put necklaces a little black side 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.630
 for it to hold it clear 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.390
 privilege the continents if you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.920
 do not have a necklace because when you 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 white this meaning was fast 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.840
 So here it was without extension 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 usb 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.480

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.360
 black is the least red is the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.480
 more so after the red you put 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.120
