this stick and you have a traditional

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.349 
this stick and you have a traditional
shaft<00:00:25.140> geometry<00:00:25.820> meaning<00:00:26.820> that's<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
shaft geometry meaning that's gonna have

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.329 
shaft geometry meaning that's gonna have
the<00:00:27.390> straight<00:00:28.230> sidewalls<00:00:28.829> you're<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.220> gonna

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
the straight sidewalls you're not gonna

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.310 
the straight sidewalls you're not gonna
have<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> concave<00:00:29.789> feel<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.779> has

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
have a concave feel to it it has

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.800 
have a concave feel to it it has
slightly<00:00:31.859> rounded<00:00:32.220> corners<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.030> none<00:00:33.210> overly

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
that grip and stick control as we move

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.270 
that grip and stick control as we move
down<00:00:51.270> you'll<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> call<00:00:52.470> out<00:00:52.620> feature<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
down you'll see the call out feature of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.030 
down you'll see the call out feature of
the<00:00:53.400> stick<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.060> power<00:00:54.300> port<00:00:54.660> zone<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
the stick the power port zone this is

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.500 
the stick the power port zone this is
going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> oat<00:00:56.760> ekdanai

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
going to be the oat ekdanai

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
going to be the oat ekdanai
and<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.350> stick<00:00:58.590> being<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.010> 303<00:00:59.430> SiC<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and this stick being the 303 SiC you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
and this stick being the 303 SiC you
have<00:01:00.540> three<00:01:01.050> arches<00:01:01.500> built<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.220> here<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
have three arches built in here and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
have three arches built in here and
they're<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.120> exactly<00:01:03.300> those<00:01:03.780> OHS<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
they're not exactly those OHS that you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
they're not exactly those OHS that you
may<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.070> seen<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> 9k<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.540> previous

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
may have seen on the 9k from previous

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
may have seen on the 9k from previous
years<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.219> to<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:08.820> nice

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
years but it's going to have some nice

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.080 
years but it's going to have some nice
features<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.749> going<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:09.960> decrease

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
features that it's going to decrease

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.279 
features that it's going to decrease
drag<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> stick<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.929> going<00:01:13.109> to<00:01:13.170> have

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
drag on the stick and it's going to have

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.499 
drag on the stick and it's going to have
better<00:01:13.530> aerodynamics<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.759> so<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.359> you're

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
better aerodynamics to it so as you're

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.700 
better aerodynamics to it so as you're
taking<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.869> shots<00:01:16.079> there's<00:01:16.289> gonna<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.469> less

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
taking your shots there's gonna be less

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
taking your shots there's gonna be less
resistance<00:01:17.399> this<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.179> also<00:01:18.359> who's<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.719> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
resistance this is also who's going to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.569 
resistance this is also who's going to
increase<00:01:19.319> the<00:01:19.530> overall<00:01:19.560> strength<00:01:20.219> of<00:01:20.460> this

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
increase the overall strength of this

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.609 
increase the overall strength of this
portion<00:01:20.999> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.359> stick<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:22.109> especially

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
portion of the stick which is especially

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.169 
portion of the stick which is especially
nice<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.490> typically<00:01:23.969> we're

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
nice because this is typically we're

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.419 
nice because this is typically we're
getting<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.479> hacks<00:01:24.719> and<00:01:24.990> slashes<00:01:25.499> so<00:01:26.249> each

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
getting your hacks and slashes so each

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:27.649 
getting your hacks and slashes so each
of<00:01:26.460> those<00:01:26.670> arches<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.569> to

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
of those arches is just going to

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.139 
of those arches is just going to
increase<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.289> overall<00:01:28.380> strength<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.219> it's

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
increase the overall strength to it it's

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.760 
increase the overall strength to it it's
going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.539> a<00:01:30.569> nice<00:01:30.840> job<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.350> far<00:01:31.499> as<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
going to do a nice job as far as it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
going to do a nice job as far as it
still<00:01:31.979> tapers<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.789> bit<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:32.999> you're

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
still tapers down a little bit so you're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
still tapers down a little bit so you're
going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:34.139> bit<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> lower

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
going to get a little bit of a lower

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.300 
going to get a little bit of a lower
kick<00:01:35.009> point<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.609> quite<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.119> low<00:01:36.539> as<00:01:36.840> say

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
kick point not as quite as low as say

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.770 
kick point not as quite as low as say
the<00:01:38.310> other<00:01:38.490> line<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.030> Reebok<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.689> it's
