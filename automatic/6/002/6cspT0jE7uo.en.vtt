00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
know that's he did rule though that the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
know that's he did rule though that the
f<00:00:37.410> word<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.890> used<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.250> adjective<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:39.059> was

not meant to describe any sexual act and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.619
