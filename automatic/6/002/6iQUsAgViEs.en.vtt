00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
dimensions in height length and width so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.190 
dimensions in height length and width so
that<00:03:24.370> will<00:03:24.730> be<00:03:24.850> easier<00:03:25.209> for<00:03:25.240> us<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.510> stack<00:03:25.930> them

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
that will be easier for us to stack them
