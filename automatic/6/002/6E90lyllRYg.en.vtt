inform craft 4.1 and we're going to be
learning<00:00:06.270> about<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> infernal<00:00:07.350> furnace<00:00:08.690> so

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
learning about the infernal furnace so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.910 
learning about the infernal furnace so
for<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.110> front<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.349> furnace<00:00:10.650> you're<00:00:10.800> going

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
for the in front of furnace you're going

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.799 
for the in front of furnace you're going
to<00:00:10.980> need<00:00:11.099> some<00:00:11.429> scribing<00:00:12.120> tools<00:00:12.269> answer<00:00:12.599> paper

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to need some scribing tools answer paper

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.530 
to need some scribing tools answer paper
and<00:00:13.110> then<00:00:13.469> 12<00:00:13.860> obsidian<00:00:14.460> 12<00:00:14.940> never<00:00:15.150> break<00:00:15.360> a

back into the table and you'll see here

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.520 
back into the table and you'll see here
this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.640> need<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:41.250> use<00:00:41.730> prick

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
this is what we need so we can use prick

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
this is what we need so we can use prick

potentia to connect to metal 'm fruit
Otto<00:00:47.450> Otto<00:00:48.450> directly<00:00:48.960> collect<00:00:49.379> connects

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
Otto Otto directly collect connects

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
Otto Otto directly collect connects
we've<00:00:50.520> meant<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.480> join

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
we've meant to them so we can just join

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.319 
we've meant to them so we can just join
it<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.690> then<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.899> fire<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
it like that and then to get fire to

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
it like that and then to get fire to
form<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.710> through<00:00:58.920> Lux<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.370> put<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
form we can go through Lux they put a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
form we can go through Lux they put a
Lux<00:01:00.030> their<00:01:01.460> air<00:01:02.460> their<00:01:03.320> Lux<00:01:04.320> left<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.250> they're

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Lux their air their Lux left so they're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.200 
Lux their air their Lux left so they're
joined<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:06.840> let's<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.130> from<00:01:08.130> Orem<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
joined and now let's get from Orem to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.630 
joined and now let's get from Orem to
there<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.869> auto

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
there or there to there we can do auto

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.140 
there or there to there we can do auto
which<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.970> goes<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:16.580> instrumentum<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
which then goes to instrumentum which is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.620 
which then goes to instrumentum which is
humanness<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.900> auto<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.830> humanness<00:01:20.630> orders

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
humanness and auto so humanness orders

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
humanness and auto so humanness orders
do<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.080> 4<00:01:22.470> times<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> make<00:01:23.369> sure

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
do that about 4 times just to make sure

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.170 
do that about 4 times just to make sure
we<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.700> enough<00:01:24.890> they're<00:01:25.890> connected<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> Otto

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
we got enough they're connected and Otto

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260 
we got enough they're connected and Otto
will<00:01:27.900> connect<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> join<00:01:29.579> those<00:01:29.790> two<00:01:30.060> we

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
will connect just to join those two we

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.149 
will connect just to join those two we
can<00:01:30.450> put<00:01:32.450> metal<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:34.950> joined

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
can put metal and now that's all joined

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
can put metal and now that's all joined
I've<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> discovery<00:01:36.240> notes<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.500> we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I've got the discovery notes now that we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
I've got the discovery notes now that we
got<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> discovery<00:01:38.520> notes<00:01:38.729> right<00:01:39.119> click<00:01:39.329> them

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
got the discovery notes right click them

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.170 
got the discovery notes right click them
and<00:01:40.009> we<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.369> unlocked<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> our

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and we will have unlocked it and our

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.160 
and we will have unlocked it and our
Foreman<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.520> we've<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
Foreman on so now that we've got that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.480 
Foreman on so now that we've got that
this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> construct<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:49.310> ok<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this is the way to construct it ok so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.620 
this is the way to construct it ok so
now<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.259> mind<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.630> arcane

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
now I'm back in my mind where my arcane

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.889 
now I'm back in my mind where my arcane
bores<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:56.119> I'm<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> show<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
bores and I'm going to show you how to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.569 
bores and I'm going to show you how to
set<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.040> look<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.310> formal

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
set it up so if we look at our formal

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.990 
set it up so if we look at our formal
nomicon<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.810> cross<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> obsidian<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
nomicon it is cross of obsidian on the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.190 
nomicon it is cross of obsidian on the
floor<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:05.719> that's<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> middle<00:02:07.110> 1<00:02:07.829> 2<00:02:08.129> 3<00:02:08.340> 4<00:02:09.200> 5

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
floor so that's the middle 1 2 3 4 5

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.070 
floor so that's the middle 1 2 3 4 5
like<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.520> never<00:02:12.000> brick

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
like that then never brick

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.180 
like that then never brick
in<00:02:14.480> f3<00:02:15.480> core<00:02:16.440> box<00:02:18.710> like<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:21.920> I'll<00:02:22.920> sort

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
in f3 core box like that then I'll sort

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.500 
in f3 core box like that then I'll sort
