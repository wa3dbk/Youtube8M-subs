then create new layer and apply brushes thunder and lightings

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the BE brushes are downloadable in the description of the video, well, after applying, create light blue, to apply it [Outer Glow] you decide on the tone of their ecenary

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
after placing the amount of thunder, it only remains to give them color, may leave them so, for that look good in white, but if not, use the [Outer Glow]
