00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.110
 It is increasing 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.110
 We distribute to batter box for the third time today 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.519
 199 hits 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.519
 Season 200 hits in Japan 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:17.679
 Batting rate is considered 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.619
 40 minutes 4 minutes 7 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.169
 Aoki is 30% 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 4 minutes 4 pieces 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.109
 Good for so-called health 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 But what exactly is it 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.700
 It is the best if you suppress the locally grown rice there 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
 Up 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 Only 2 left 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 Not new 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.950
 1st at bat 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.250
 Football 3 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.680
 Investment timing 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 Before at bat 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 I was talking about the festival 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 It may be a pain in the lecturer 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.220
 I agree 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.730
 You can shift to a system without telling you on the spot 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.730
 And of course 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.730
 Up to 200 hits 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
 The king's hand 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.550
 Class 1 higher ball 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 Baystars battery 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.740
 Already prepared by customers 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.760
 The second hit of this level if one goes out 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 It will be said 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.059
 Full article 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.439
 Proudly 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 Proudly 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.959
 I'm not good at the fixed number I've accumulated 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.879
 Start victory 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.879
 First achievement in history 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.569
 It is a server blade 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.289
 As expected 3rd village place 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.829
 It has become a name that can not take Maren. A strong strike is a first baseman. 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.569
 Araki entered 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.059
 Open call for participants 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.329
 In the main hall 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.239
 Bananas are too bright, so give up 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.489
 Asian stocks also high 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.799
 With the right batter 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.919
 And it's not a type of relative 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.879
 And it's not the type that looks at the ball carefully 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.159
 but
