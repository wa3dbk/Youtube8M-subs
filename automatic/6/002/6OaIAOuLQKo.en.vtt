pearl<00:01:18.119> essence<00:01:18.509> chillin<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
pearl essence chillin right there and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
pearl essence chillin right there and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
then obviously as you see me doing right

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
then obviously as you see me doing right
now<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.130> matte<00:01:23.460> finish<00:01:23.850> has<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> pearlescent

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
now the matte finish has the pearlescent

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109 
now the matte finish has the pearlescent
underneath<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.740> found<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
underneath it I found that if you use a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.080 
underneath it I found that if you use a
dark<00:01:27.479> color<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> bright<00:01:28.619> colors

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
dark color and you put the bright colors

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
dark color and you put the bright colors
over<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.360> underneath<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.140> guess<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> could

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
over or underneath it I guess you could

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.280 
over or underneath it I guess you could
say<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:32.759> looks<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> lot<00:01:33.299> better<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.689> lot<00:01:33.780> cleaner
