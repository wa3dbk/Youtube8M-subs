can see start from the bottom so mmm

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
can see start from the bottom so mmm
green<00:01:51.000> feet<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:52.049> green<00:01:52.200> further

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
green feet here little green further

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.490 
green feet here little green further
let's<00:01:52.860> start<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.220> their<00:01:54.049> next<00:01:55.049> set

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
let's start with their next set

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.380 
let's start with their next set
and<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.729> leg<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:58.939> slightly

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
and that's and the leg is slightly

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.130 
and that's and the leg is slightly
different

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
different

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.109 
different
okay<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.979> kind<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.520> break<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.820> called<00:02:02.060> a

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
okay so this kind of break is called a

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.880 
okay so this kind of break is called a
roofie<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:02.840> he's<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.170> running<00:02:03.439> sort<00:02:03.770> of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
roofie so he's in a running sort of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.819 
roofie so he's in a running sort of
position<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:06.020> one<00:02:06.200> would<00:02:06.350> go<00:02:06.469> also

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
position so that one would go also

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.979 
position so that one would go also
towards<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.939> then<00:02:08.269> back<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.869> other

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
towards you and then back to the other

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.570 
towards you and then back to the other
leg<00:02:09.259> we<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:09.769> using<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.160> slightly<00:02:10.459> different

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
leg we are using a slightly different

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.089 
leg we are using a slightly different
route<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.629> one<00:02:11.930> also<00:02:11.959> goes<00:02:12.500> towards<00:02:12.800> you

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
route so that one also goes towards you

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.600 
route so that one also goes towards you
like<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.550> mm-hmm<00:02:14.560> okay<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.250> we're

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
like that mm-hmm okay and then we're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.970 
like that mm-hmm okay and then we're
coming<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.300> where<00:02:17.599> we<00:02:17.780> start<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.230> join<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.800> two

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
coming to where we start to join the two

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.610 
coming to where we start to join the two
legs<00:02:19.190> together<00:02:19.430> yeah<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.840> use<00:02:21.019> these<00:02:21.260> kind

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
legs together yeah so we use these kind

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.610 
legs together yeah so we use these kind
of<00:02:21.830> flat<00:02:22.190> brick<00:02:22.910> circle<00:02:23.480> plates<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.440> put

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
of flat brick circle plates if you put

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.119 
of flat brick circle plates if you put
the<00:02:24.709> plates<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> larger<00:02:25.940> room<00:02:26.150> first

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
the plates on the larger room first

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.880 
the plates on the larger room first
that<00:02:28.129> okay<00:02:28.670> unless<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.239> can<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.630> these<00:02:30.470> two

studs here mm-hmm

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.880 
studs here mm-hmm
go<00:02:33.680> underneath<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> side<00:02:35.599> right<00:02:36.560> okay

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
go underneath on the side right okay

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.039 
go underneath on the side right okay
same<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.849> think<00:02:38.000> he's<00:02:38.180> running<00:02:38.329> towards<00:02:38.870> you

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
okay like that and just to secure it a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.080 
okay like that and just to secure it a
bit<00:02:45.650> more<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:45.980> give<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.190> more<00:02:46.370> heights<00:02:46.849> we've

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
bit more and give it more heights we've

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.880 
bit more and give it more heights we've
put<00:02:47.209> another<00:02:47.450> little<00:02:47.930> duct<00:02:48.110> double<00:02:48.470> play<00:02:48.650> back

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
put another little duct double play back

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.890 
put another little duct double play back
and<00:02:49.099> then<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:49.700> start<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> body<00:02:50.239> so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and then we can start the body so

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.350 
and then we can start the body so
another<00:02:51.200> 2<00:02:51.500> by<00:02:51.709> 3<00:02:51.980> plate<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.610> another<00:02:53.150> one<00:02:53.329> on

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
another 2 by 3 plate and another one on

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.729 
another 2 by 3 plate and another one on
top<00:02:54.489> okay<00:02:55.489> nice<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.299> into<00:02:56.690> yellow<00:02:57.140> platelets

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
top okay nice and into yellow platelets

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.729 
top okay nice and into yellow platelets
so<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.579> we're<00:02:58.730> coming<00:02:58.849> up<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.120> where<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.079> arms

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
so now we're coming up to where the arms

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.479 
so now we're coming up to where the arms
starting<00:03:01.549> out<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.720> shoulders<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.650> if<00:03:04.250> we

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
starting out of the shoulders so if we

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.629 
starting out of the shoulders so if we
build<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.870> front<00:03:06.139> of<00:03:06.350> Henry<00:03:06.859> first<00:03:07.190> which

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
build the the front of Henry first which

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.680 
build the the front of Henry first which
is<00:03:07.880> 3<00:03:08.299> or<00:03:08.510> 3<00:03:09.319> 1<00:03:09.470> by<00:03:09.530> 3<00:03:09.709> plates<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.730> then<00:03:11.450> we<00:03:11.510> need

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
is 3 or 3 1 by 3 plates and then we need

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.509 
is 3 or 3 1 by 3 plates and then we need
3<00:03:11.900> washing<00:03:12.350> machine<00:03:12.680> bricks<00:03:12.920> which<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.340> where

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
3 washing machine bricks which is where

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.670 
3 washing machine bricks which is where
his<00:03:13.819> arms<00:03:14.090> are<00:03:14.180> gonna<00:03:14.269> join<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.989> stud

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
his arms are gonna join on the stud

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.069 
his arms are gonna join on the stud
needs<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.130> face<00:03:16.310> outwards<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.480> sides<00:03:17.720> and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
needs to face outwards on the sides and

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.340 
needs to face outwards on the sides and
then<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.560> stud<00:03:18.889> faces<00:03:19.400> backwards<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.989> away

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
then the stud faces backwards so away
