00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 here we have hard bread this as a project 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.549
 has three days and what we have done 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 I started to leave it whole already we have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.449
 cut as you see we have carried 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.550
 rubbed nothing and we've left it to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.680
 dry already in slices 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.300
 apart from this we have here 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.070
 300 grams of milk 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.890
 9 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.780
 in three eggs 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.780
 and then to decorate 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.690
 It's sugar and cinnamon 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.910
 and here we have the pan with oil 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.150
 sunflower that we are going to put to heat 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 now more 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.450
 good we put the eggs for you 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:04.189
 so enjoy 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.189
 [Applause] 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.409
 and such a fact 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.219
 this now we beat it well 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.219
 and here we will start the sexual slice 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 good as you see we have thrown the mixture 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the oven tray and we have gone 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.940
 turning it around we go around the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 bread by two degrees until it soaks 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.770
 partly well all the mixture 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 at the time I had already soaked 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.650
 all are looted the source of clean 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 the bread has soaked all eggs with the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.460
 sugar and milk and we have them ready 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.460
 to fry 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.090
 we already have the first 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.939
 and now we get it important and about the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.170
 absorbent paper to remove the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.170
 excess oil 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.130
 we will win and we're getting 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.080
 references 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.450
 well we have already removed them from paper 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.290
 absorbing and now that the source what 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.970
 only thing that remains is to stand up that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.030
 we have mixed put in the pot this 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.600
 we have mixed sugary with cinnamon 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.250
 and now let's sprinkle well with 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.220
 this mix slip a single bonissi 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.210
 inside the friend inside the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.430
 mine stays the milk was juicy and the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.900
 taste of the race to focus on 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.439
 outside transmissions 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.870
 You see something easy, very cheap because 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.090
 you can use the pantheon about you can go 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.960
 saving what to do this 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.210
 and registration 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.390
 I hope you liked it and even the
