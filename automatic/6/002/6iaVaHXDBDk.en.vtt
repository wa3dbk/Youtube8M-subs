00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.109
 it shows how it is possible to create animations by which of the students 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.320
 monitors 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.669
 even though I'm going to room 6 5 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.639
 and let's not forget to have one more of our part of the frame the images already 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.649
 ready 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.810
 which will be the case here 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.779
 of the sound emitted soon from the faith 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 that these texts and images that I am going to use as an example are of this face that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 thank you so much, go 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.730
 no move and let's not here foreclosure termination 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.300
 p here in duration of the images of three are in the base but the maximum possible 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.720
 3 to 1 with the mainz 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.220
 we deal here 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.660
 Romanelli who import 20 more 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 we import the others that past the productions 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.460
 importance in mining it if it did not study how we are to the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.640
 time 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.930
 it's not a little bit 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 and then but here we go file 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.430
 Talk about the movie 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 we get saved 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.930
 when it loads ii 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.690
 It's because of my calculations. 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.020
 peiser case of rafale-3 which are the most lasting 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.920
 is equal to half of what each print of the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.040
 animation 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.460
 what but fair and we will see how to solve soon 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.180
 finally finished 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 that results in this video here 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.840
 baby talks could attract said earlier 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 he still so little literate does not give the impression of being in our right 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.160
 but let's create a new project here 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.000
 Get these kim images 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.070
 and it is not in order that he exists but that I love you 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 no matter the victim 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 we are not there for the timeline 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.400
 that it is not that he is divided 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.760
 selected or sold on the timeline 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.490
 and added that status of increasing the dose of folded drug city of lis 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.779
 let's go here file 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.529
 room movie file 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.529
 I'll talk 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.230
 and now it will export the video and indiavaÃ­ mount a little more an act to the 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.619
 see result 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.539
 not even done that 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 I ask myself here 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.699
 and how they chose to vote is already much faster and 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.119
 animation ied print
