00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.240 

okay<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.370> on<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:03.440> supernova<00:00:04.440> Julia

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay this is on a supernova Julia

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.870 
okay this is on a supernova Julia
and<00:00:06.859> unlike<00:00:07.859> modern<00:00:08.099> machines<00:00:08.610> where<00:00:08.820> you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
and unlike modern machines where you

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.610 
and unlike modern machines where you
just<00:00:09.030> kind<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.269> stick<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.320> press<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
just kind of stick it in and press a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
just kind of stick it in and press a
button<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.580> everything<00:00:11.880> does<00:00:12.420> everything

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
button and everything does everything

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.079 
button and everything does everything
for<00:00:13.080> you

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
for you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.450 
for you
Julia<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.509> not<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.109> manual<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Julia is not it's manual so what I

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.000 
Julia is not it's manual so what I
usually<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.150> put<00:00:18.359> some<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.260> depends

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
usually do is I put some of this depends

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.029 
usually do is I put some of this depends
on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> project<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
on the project for this one I have the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
on the project for this one I have the
tearaway<00:00:24.740> embroidery<00:00:25.789> paper<00:00:26.789> where<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
tearaway embroidery paper where you can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
tearaway embroidery paper where you can
do<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.650> design<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> outside<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
do your design on it on the outside and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.600 
do your design on it on the outside and
then<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.920> fill<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
then you go in and fill it in on the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
then you go in and fill it in on the
inside<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> always<00:00:33.270> start<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
inside and I always start with going in

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
inside and I always start with going in
one<00:00:34.680> spot<00:00:34.920> first<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> knot<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
one spot first to kind of knot the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
one spot first to kind of knot the
thread<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> center<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> there's<00:00:38.070> no<00:00:38.280> zig

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
thread in the center so there's no zig

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
thread in the center so there's no zig
and<00:00:39.210> Ivana<00:00:39.840> Julia<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> adjust<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and Ivana Julia you have to adjust the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.670 
and Ivana Julia you have to adjust the
six<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> adjust<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
six you have to adjust this over here to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.990 
six you have to adjust this over here to
a<00:00:43.710> satin<00:00:44.070> stitch<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
a satin stitch you have to go all the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
a satin stitch you have to go all the
way<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.170> red<00:00:46.289> dot<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
way down to the little red dot on the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.010 
way down to the little red dot on the
dial<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.570> then<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.530> usually<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.579> about

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
dial and then I usually go up to about

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.770 
dial and then I usually go up to about
about<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> five<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> zig<00:00:54.329> which<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
about a five on the on the zig which is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
about a five on the on the zig which is
pretty<00:00:54.989> wide<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.030> what

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pretty wide but I it and that's what

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.170 
pretty wide but I it and that's what
gets<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.750> pretty<00:00:58.609> stitching<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> center

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
gets the pretty stitching in the center

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.389 
gets the pretty stitching in the center
and<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.649> usually<00:01:01.859> go

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and what I'm going to do is I usually go

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.070 
and what I'm going to do is I usually go
and<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> outside<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.690> whatever<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and I take the outside of whatever the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.020 
and I take the outside of whatever the
object<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.309> case<00:01:05.549> we're<00:01:06.000> making

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
object is in this case we're making

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.890 
object is in this case we're making
leaves<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> outside<00:01:09.060> first<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
leaves so I go on the outside first and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
leaves so I go on the outside first and
then<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.560> I'm<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> go

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
then as I'm going it's you have to go

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
then as I'm going it's you have to go
pretty<00:01:12.420> high<00:01:12.600> speed<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.229> order<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
pretty high speed in order to with the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.120 
pretty high speed in order to with the
pedal<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.909> order<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> stitches

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pedal in order to get the the stitches

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
pedal in order to get the the stitches
tight<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> close<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.280> I'll<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.520> on

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
tight and close and this so I'll go on

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.249 
tight and close and this so I'll go on
the<00:01:20.729> outside<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.659> I'll<00:01:21.810> fill<00:01:22.080> on

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the outside first and then I'll fill on

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.039 
the outside first and then I'll fill on
the<00:01:22.380> inside<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:24.540> works<00:01:24.780> with

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the inside and that's how it works with

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.740 
the inside and that's how it works with
the<00:01:25.140> julia<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:26.729> order<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.210> patterns<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the julia in order to make patterns that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.140 
the julia in order to make patterns that
look<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.409> done<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.790> modern

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
look like it was done with a modern

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
look like it was done with a modern
machine<00:01:30.299> even<00:01:30.659> though<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.740> old<00:01:32.100> one

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
machine even though it is a very old one

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:47.890 
machine even though it is a very old one
so<00:01:32.610> let's<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.030> ahead<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.299> fill<00:01:33.450> out

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.270 

and<00:01:53.140> once<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.230> looks<00:01:54.410> pretty<00:01:54.650> nicely<00:01:54.950> filled

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and once it looks pretty nicely filled

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.650 
and once it looks pretty nicely filled
you<00:01:55.460> don't<00:01:55.640> want<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.820> overfill<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.330> because

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
you don't want to overfill it because

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.510 
you don't want to overfill it because
then<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.870> just<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.200> sloppy<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:57.860> then<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.400> go

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
then it just get sloppy and then it go

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.040 
then it just get sloppy and then it go
ahead<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.760> take<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.210> all<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.540> way<00:01:59.630> down<00:01:59.750> to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
ahead and take it all the way down to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.650 
ahead and take it all the way down to
zero<00:02:00.470> on<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.760> zig<00:02:01.970> because<00:02:02.270> we<00:02:02.390> run<00:02:02.540> it

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
zero on the on the zig because we run it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.540 
zero on the on the zig because we run it
just<00:02:02.690> like<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:03.110> straight<00:02:03.440> stitch<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:04.370> like

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
just like a straight stitch just like

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.230 
just like a straight stitch just like
nodding<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.360> center<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.530> mm-hmm<00:02:07.370> so

I'm wanting specific sections to have
the<00:02:59.390> measurement<00:02:59.810> right<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:00.980> been

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.220 
the measurement right so it's it's been
graphed<00:03:01.430> out<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> then<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.600> fill<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.110> in
