did sort of go over a similar territory

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.120 
did sort of go over a similar territory
this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.150> essentially<00:01:36.659> organized<00:01:37.079> crime<00:01:37.439> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this is essentially organized crime it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
this is essentially organized crime it's
a<00:01:38.280> different<00:01:38.579> form<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> organized<00:01:39.270> crime<00:01:39.509> but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a different form of organized crime but

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
a different form of organized crime but
it<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.320> organized<00:01:40.799> crime<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.150> kind

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it is organized crime and so I do kind

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
it is organized crime and so I do kind
of<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:42.930> he<00:01:43.020> branches<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> little

about<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.310> ensemble<00:04:17.760> casts<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.360> that's

about the ensemble casts and that's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.360 
about the ensemble casts and that's
something<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.080> only<00:04:19.230> Scorsese<00:04:19.920> could<00:04:20.190> pull

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
something that only Scorsese could pull

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
being a complete sleazeball I did wonder

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360 
being a complete sleazeball I did wonder
while<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.440> was<00:04:40.620> watching<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.040> I<00:04:41.070> would<00:04:41.220> see<00:04:41.340> a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
while I was watching and I would see a

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.710 
while I was watching and I would see a
scene<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:41.790> would<00:04:41.940> go<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.180> they<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.480> need

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
scene and I would go do they really need

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.390 
scene and I would go do they really need
that<00:04:42.750> scene<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.380> then<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.920> scene<00:04:44.130> went<00:04:44.280> in

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that scene and then the scene went in

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760 
that scene and then the scene went in
and<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.640> would<00:04:44.700> go<00:04:44.970> no<00:04:45.900> they<00:04:46.140> did<00:04:46.380> need<00:04:46.560> that

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
and I would go no they did need that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.340 
and I would go no they did need that
scene<00:04:47.040> so<00:04:47.370> I'm<00:04:47.730> not<00:04:47.910> entirely<00:04:48.180> sure<00:04:48.330> if<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.170> was

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
scene so I'm not entirely sure if I was

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.690 
scene so I'm not entirely sure if I was
the<00:04:49.500> editor<00:04:49.590> here<00:04:50.010> what<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.250> would<00:04:50.490> cut<00:04:50.670> down

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
the editor here what I would cut down

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.670 
the editor here what I would cut down
off<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.270> runtime<00:04:51.690> either<00:04:51.870> go<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.410> see<00:04:52.590> it

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
off the runtime either go and see it

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.310 
off the runtime either go and see it
during<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.950> day<00:04:53.720> during<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.870> day<00:04:54.960> three

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
during the day during the day three

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.560 
during the day during the day three
hours<00:04:55.470> didn't<00:04:55.770> feel<00:04:56.010> very<00:04:56.310> long<00:04:56.580> for<00:04:56.940> me<00:04:57.090> it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
hours didn't feel very long for me it

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.090 
hours didn't feel very long for me it
feels<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.990> lot<00:04:58.140> shorter<00:04:58.290> than<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.590> Hobbit<00:04:58.920> I'll

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
feels a lot shorter than the Hobbit I'll

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.650 
feels a lot shorter than the Hobbit I'll
just<00:04:59.280> say<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.580> I<00:04:59.610> mean<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:00.330> time

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
just say that I mean it's like time

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.140 
just say that I mean it's like time
well-spent<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.590> what<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.800> would<00:05:01.980> say<00:05:02.160> there<00:05:03.030> was

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
well-spent is what I would say there was

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.300 
well-spent is what I would say there was
very<00:05:03.360> little<00:05:03.570> continuity<00:05:04.350> from<00:05:04.620> cut<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:05.100> cut

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
very little continuity from cut to cut

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.250 
very little continuity from cut to cut
within<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.850> scenes<00:05:06.090> things<00:05:06.630> would<00:05:06.840> disappear

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
within the scenes things would disappear

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.570 
within the scenes things would disappear
things<00:05:07.530> would<00:05:07.650> reappear<00:05:07.860> but<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.280> doesn't

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
things would reappear but it doesn't

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.790 
things would reappear but it doesn't
matter<00:05:08.760> because<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.330> emotional<00:05:10.050> arc<00:05:10.560> between

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
matter because the emotional arc between

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.070 
matter because the emotional arc between
the<00:05:11.010> characters<00:05:11.430> was<00:05:12.030> solid<00:05:12.420> and<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.780> think

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
the characters was solid and I think

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.990 
the characters was solid and I think
Thelma<00:05:13.770> Schoonmaker<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.310> mean<00:05:14.640> she<00:05:14.850> always

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
Thelma Schoonmaker I mean she always

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.070 
Thelma Schoonmaker I mean she always
gets<00:05:15.450> lots<00:05:16.350> of<00:05:16.560> praise<00:05:16.920> because<00:05:17.660> Scorsese<00:05:18.660> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
gets lots of praise because Scorsese and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.040 
gets lots of praise because Scorsese and
her<00:05:19.230> are<00:05:19.380> like<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:19.980> powerful<00:05:20.880> team<00:05:21.270> but<00:05:21.870> yet
