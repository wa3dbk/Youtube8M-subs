00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.069 
personally feel now that you are a
better<00:03:57.730> fighter<00:03:58.090> than<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.450> were<00:03:58.599> against

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
better fighter than you were against

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.129 
better fighter than you were against
Archie<00:03:59.530> Moore<00:03:59.709> when<00:03:59.889> you<00:03:59.980> won<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.310> title<00:04:01.139> well
