 Hi! Welcome back. Today I will show you how to prepare dreams. 

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.001
 Love, friendship, relationships and all the other relationships. 

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hello? Are you trying to ridicule me?

 So what's your name? 

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:28.100
 Stephane 

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.200
 Stephane, this is Stephanie. 

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.500

 STEPHANE IS EXCELLENT 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.500
 You can see the real world in 3D. 

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.200
 Isn't the world three-dimensional? 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.000
 Yeah, but come on ... 

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.500
 STEPHANIE IS CREATIVE 

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.800
 Stephanie is a talented composer. 

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.000
 Really? 

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.000
 Pretty girl with level. This is worth mentioning. 

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:49.000
 GET A GIRL FROM SIDE DOORS… 

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.000
 Do you know the neighbor? She's really nice. 

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.200
 And yeah, danger. 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.000
 … INTEGRATING ITS INTRODUCTION. 

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.000
 Stephane is still confused. His dreams are reality. 

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.000
 Do you want to say something? 

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.500
 I like you. 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.000
 You mean in a romantic way? 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:16.000
 Don't ever go out with her. He'll bring you to mind. 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.000
 I'll never get what I like. 

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.500
 I know you're here. 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.500
 What's with your head? 

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:23.500
 It is allright. It is normal. 

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.500
 It will never be normal again. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.000
 I think people don't agree with what I'm doing because it comes from here. 

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.500
 IN THE PERFECT WORLD… 

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.000
 Hi. Hi. 

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.000
 … THEY SHOULD BE PERFECTLY TOGETHER. 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.500
 BUT THE DREAMS MAY BE HIGH. 

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.000
 You have a serious problem with separating reality. 

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:54.000
 I don't like you crying. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.000
 I'm glad we live side by side. 

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.000
