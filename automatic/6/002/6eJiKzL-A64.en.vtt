Tom came out with a statement saying

Tom came out with a statement saying
that<00:00:21.150> infinite<00:00:22.050> worlds<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.680> zero<00:00:23.519> 9.0<00:00:24.210> worlds

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that infinite worlds or zero 9.0 worlds

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.560 
that infinite worlds or zero 9.0 worlds
can<00:00:24.660> absolutely<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.800> infinite<00:00:26.480> 10,000<00:00:27.480> by

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
can absolutely be infinite 10,000 by

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.750 
can absolutely be infinite 10,000 by
10,000<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.439> actually<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> default

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
10,000 is actually just the default

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.479 
10,000 is actually just the default
world<00:00:30.359> sighs<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.250> said

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
world sighs so you know how they said

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.770 
world sighs so you know how they said
that<00:00:32.579> there's<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.120> different<00:00:33.480> world

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that there's going to be different world

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.560 
that there's going to be different world
size<00:00:34.710> options<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> small<00:00:36.030> medium<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
size options like a small medium and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.410 
size options like a small medium and
large<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.230> infinite<00:00:37.760> well<00:00:38.760> 10,000

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
large and then infinite well 10,000

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.729 
large and then infinite well 10,000
looks<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> base

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
looks like it's going to be the base

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.720 
looks like it's going to be the base
size<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.930> select<00:00:43.350> small<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
size so if you select small that's the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
size so if you select small that's the
size<00:00:44.940> world<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> you're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:46.020> so

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
size world that you're going to get so

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.750 
size world that you're going to get so
it's<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:48.350> truly<00:00:49.350> infinite<00:00:49.890> worlds<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's actually truly infinite worlds and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's actually truly infinite worlds and
Jeb<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.960> worded<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.559> completely<00:00:53.039> wrong<00:00:53.280> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Jeb just worded it completely wrong so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
Jeb just worded it completely wrong so
thanks<00:00:54.000> Jeb<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.510> causing<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> huge<00:00:55.079> scare<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
thanks Jeb for causing a huge scare in

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
thanks Jeb for causing a huge scare in
the<00:00:55.590> community<00:00:56.070> still<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> topic<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the community still on a topic of

the community still on a topic of
infinite<00:00:58.260> worlds<00:00:58.590> tom<00:00:58.859> says<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.520> because

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
infinite worlds tom says that because

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
infinite worlds tom says that because
they<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.449> short<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.930> time<00:01:01.260> they're<00:01:01.530> actually

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
they are short on time they're actually

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.440 
they are short on time they're actually
going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.660> add<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.110> world<00:01:04.409> limits<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.450> zero

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
going to add the world limits in zero

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.770 
going to add the world limits in zero
point<00:01:06.630> nine<00:01:06.659> point<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.979> means<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:09.510> um

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
point nine point one which means that um

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.679 
point nine point one which means that um
basically<00:01:10.590> alt<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.610> literally<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.420> on

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
basically alt will literally go on

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.950 
basically alt will literally go on
forever<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.909> only<00:01:15.150> stop<00:01:15.630> once

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
forever and they will only stop once

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
forever and they will only stop once
your<00:01:16.170> phone<00:01:16.350> runs<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> memory<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:18.000> that's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
your phone runs out of memory so that's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
your phone runs out of memory so that's
actually<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:20.159> interesting<00:01:20.520> though<00:01:21.030> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
actually pretty interesting though it's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810 
actually pretty interesting though it's
not<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.140> greatest<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> hear<00:01:23.220> because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
not the greatest thing to hear because

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.929 
not the greatest thing to hear because
servers<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.900> how<00:01:25.110> someone<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.580> crash

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
servers and how someone can they crash

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.170 
servers and how someone can they crash
the<00:01:27.150> server<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.930> forever<00:01:28.290> um<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the server going on forever um what is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
the server going on forever um what is
good<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.780> though<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.079> how<00:01:31.619> else<00:01:31.920> will

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
good about this though is how else will

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.749 
good about this though is how else will
quite<00:01:32.490> literally<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.799> forever<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
quite literally go on forever so we

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
quite literally go on forever so we
don't<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.299> worry<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.689> world

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
don't have to worry about world

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
don't have to worry about world
boundaries<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.030> ones<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.420> up

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
boundaries and you run up ones you're up

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.359 
boundaries and you run up ones you're up
it<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.259> added<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> later<00:01:41.159> update

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it that will be added in a later update

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.480 
it that will be added in a later update
now<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.360> reddit<00:01:42.990> Tom<00:01:43.590> did<00:01:43.920> say<00:01:44.159> something

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
now on reddit Tom did say something

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
now on reddit Tom did say something
about<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:45.149> after<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.470> certain<00:01:46.860> amount<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
about how after a certain amount of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880 
about how after a certain amount of
blocks<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.060> code<00:01:48.479> itself<00:01:48.990> begins<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
blocks the game code itself begins to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.060 
blocks the game code itself begins to
fall<00:01:50.759> apart<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.710> again<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.920> are

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
fall apart because again there are

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.609 
fall apart because again there are
limitations<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.880> code<00:01:54.180> um<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
limitations in code um they are going to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.060 
limitations in code um they are going to
have<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.890> work<00:01:56.100> around<00:01:56.340> those<00:01:56.939> boundaries<00:01:57.540> so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
have to work around those boundaries so

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.350 
have to work around those boundaries so
the<00:01:59.070> world's<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> as<00:01:59.909> big<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.240> they

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the world's will not be as big as they

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
the world's will not be as big as they
will<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.780> pc<00:02:01.259> once<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> boundaries<00:02:02.100> are

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
will be in pc once the boundaries are

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.060 
will be in pc once the boundaries are
added<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.200> still<00:02:04.350> quite

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
added but they will still quite

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
added but they will still quite
literally<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
literally be and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.749 
literally be and
