I'll<00:00:57.780> talk<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.379> second<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.100> from

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
I'll talk about that in a second so from

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
I'll talk about that in a second so from
the<00:00:59.370> specs<00:00:59.579> specs<00:01:00.210> Department<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> isn't

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the specs specs Department this isn't

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.340 
the specs specs Department this isn't
very<00:01:01.289> fancy<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> sits<00:01:02.340> around<00:01:02.489> three

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
very fancy at all it sits around three

very fancy at all it sits around three
the<00:01:04.350> three<00:01:04.500> megapixel<00:01:04.949> or<00:01:05.010> five<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the three megapixel or five I think it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.289 
the three megapixel or five I think it's
five<00:01:05.850> megapixels<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.909> got<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> three

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
five megapixels and it's got a three

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
five megapixels and it's got a three
times<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> digital<00:01:10.020> zoom<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.890> also<00:01:11.010> takes

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
times the digital zoom it also takes

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.050 
times the digital zoom it also takes
video<00:01:12.090> shots<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.810> video<00:01:13.490> playback<00:01:14.490> shot<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
video shots or video playback shot so it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
also takes cameras of course camera

one<00:03:27.549> which<00:03:27.790> means<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.180> you're<00:03:28.569> not<00:03:28.720> gonna<00:03:28.840> have

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
one which means I you're not gonna have

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.470 
one which means I you're not gonna have
like<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.410> lot<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.010> modes<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.639> settings<00:03:30.700> it's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
like a lot of modes and settings it's

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.150 
like a lot of modes and settings it's
not<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> second<00:03:32.200> screen<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.769> here<00:03:32.980> it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
not like a second screen in here it's

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.800 
not like a second screen in here it's
not<00:03:33.310> marrying<00:03:33.819> what<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.030> see<00:03:34.239> from<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.480> LCD

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
not marrying what you see from the LCD

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.270 
not marrying what you see from the LCD
so<00:03:35.139> it's<00:03:35.260> basically<00:03:35.530> just<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.799> clear<00:03:36.040> glass

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
so it's basically just a clear glass

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.069 
so it's basically just a clear glass
showing<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.299> what<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.660> see<00:03:37.870> on<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
showing that what you can see on the

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.490 
showing that what you can see on the
front<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> basic<00:03:40.720> carousel<00:03:41.380> of

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
front so you have a basic carousel of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.900 
front so you have a basic carousel of
different<00:03:41.799> features<00:03:42.130> including<00:03:42.519> your<00:03:42.639> stomp

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
different features including your stomp

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.030 
different features including your stomp

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
selections we have an auto focus

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.659 
selections we have an auto focus
indicator<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> flash<00:03:47.500> indicator<00:03:47.950> then<00:03:48.549> one

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
indicator and a flash indicator then one

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.610 
indicator and a flash indicator then one
of<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.790> biggest<00:03:48.970> downfalls<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.569> 4600<00:03:50.349> was

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
of the biggest downfalls of the 4600 was

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.020 
of the biggest downfalls of the 4600 was
that<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.859> flash<00:03:51.130> took<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.609> long<00:03:51.790> time<00:03:51.819> to

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
that the flash took a long time to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.150 
that the flash took a long time to
recharge<00:03:52.540> after<00:03:53.290> which<00:03:53.440> took<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.620> camera<00:03:53.980> shot

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
recharge after which took a camera shot

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490 
recharge after which took a camera shot
we<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.519> wait<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> few<00:03:55.030> seconds<00:03:55.419> like<00:03:56.260> three

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
we have to wait a few seconds like three

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.710 
we have to wait a few seconds like three
seconds<00:03:56.829> we<00:03:57.010> can't<00:03:57.190> let<00:03:57.730> go<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.209> tell<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
seconds we can't let go and tell the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.449 
seconds we can't let go and tell the
camera<00:03:58.930> fully<00:03:59.349> takes<00:03:59.620> shot<00:03:59.889> so<00:04:00.069> we<00:04:00.160> need<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.370> be

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
camera fully takes shot so we need to be

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.879 
camera fully takes shot so we need to be
kind<00:04:00.609> of<00:04:00.700> stable<00:04:01.150> your<00:04:01.269> hands<00:04:01.629> for<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.680> so

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
some people who are more novice in

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.650 
some people who are more novice in
taking<00:04:04.900> cameras<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.440> pictures<00:04:05.919> or<00:04:06.629> did<00:04:07.629> not

which<00:04:15.609> is<00:04:15.760> fairly<00:04:16.120> constant<00:04:16.359> most<00:04:16.870> cameras

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
which is fairly constant most cameras

all<00:04:23.510> these<00:04:23.600> dirty<00:04:23.810> screens<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.740> LCD<00:04:25.190> is

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
all these dirty screens the LCD is

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.680 
all these dirty screens the LCD is
actually<00:04:25.550> pretty<00:04:25.730> small<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.240> we've<00:04:26.540> actually

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
actually pretty small and we've actually

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.780 
actually pretty small and we've actually
have<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> little<00:04:27.320> bit<00:04:27.500> spots<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.250> here<00:04:28.490> but<00:04:28.670> it's

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
have a little bit spots on here but it's

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.730 
have a little bit spots on here but it's
fairly<00:04:29.270> small<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.350> very<00:04:30.530> low

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
fairly small and it's a very low

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.379 
fairly small and it's a very low
resolution<00:04:30.920> there's<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.520> lot<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.760> pixelation

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
resolution there's a lot of pixelation

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.760 
resolution there's a lot of pixelation
going<00:04:32.660> on<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:32.960> once<00:04:33.110> we've<00:04:33.260> uploaded<00:04:33.530> our

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
going on but once we've uploaded our

we<00:04:36.020> could<00:04:36.139> really<00:04:36.290> see<00:04:36.620> how<00:04:37.130> our<00:04:37.430> pictures

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
we could really see how our pictures

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.629 
we could really see how our pictures
took<00:04:38.030> now<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> wrap<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.290> of<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:40.160> results<00:04:40.550> of

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
took now a wrap up of the results of

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.620 
took now a wrap up of the results of
this<00:04:40.730> camera<00:04:41.180> which<00:04:41.300> we've<00:04:41.450> actually

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this camera which we've actually

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.620 
this camera which we've actually
retested<00:04:42.500> now<00:04:42.880> cameras<00:04:43.880> are<00:04:44.000> surprisingly

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
retested now cameras are surprisingly

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.480 
retested now cameras are surprisingly
decent<00:04:44.930> even<00:04:45.800> in<00:04:45.980> low<00:04:46.190> light<00:04:46.460> conditions

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
decent even in low light conditions

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.300 
decent even in low light conditions
camera<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:47.630> you're<00:04:47.720> really<00:04:48.200> stable<00:04:49.070> with<00:04:49.190> your

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
camera if you're really stable with your

came<00:04:52.400> out<00:04:52.580> very<00:04:52.820> bright<00:04:53.180> very<00:04:53.389> crisp<00:04:53.930> and

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
came out very bright very crisp and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.680 
came out very bright very crisp and
color<00:04:55.490> saturation<00:04:55.850> was<00:04:56.090> good<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.480> there's

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
color saturation was good and there's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.930 
color saturation was good and there's
not<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.870> lot<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.430> deformation<00:04:58.430> in<00:04:58.580> terms<00:04:58.760> of

not a lot of deformation in terms of

surprisingly<00:05:23.870> for<00:05:24.020> such<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:24.169> small<00:05:24.440> camera<00:05:25.150> so

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
surprisingly for such a small camera so

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.780 
surprisingly for such a small camera so
overall<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:27.710> know<00:05:27.800> it's<00:05:27.830> still<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> pretty

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
overall you know it's still a pretty

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.659 
overall you know it's still a pretty
surprisingly<00:05:29.540> decent<00:05:29.750> camera<00:05:30.260> for<00:05:30.979> perhaps

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
surprisingly decent camera for perhaps

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.670 
surprisingly decent camera for perhaps
for<00:05:31.880> some<00:05:32.000> younger<00:05:32.360> kids<00:05:32.450> or<00:05:32.870> fruit<00:05:33.229> people<00:05:33.470> if

for some younger kids or fruit people if

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.469 
for some younger kids or fruit people if
you<00:05:33.860> still<00:05:34.610> find<00:05:34.790> one<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:34.970> these<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.330> not

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
you still find one of these it's not

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.350 
you still find one of these it's not
necessarily<00:05:36.020> extinct<00:05:36.800> device<00:05:37.490> just<00:05:37.910> video

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
necessarily extinct device just video

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.540 
necessarily extinct device just video
quality<00:05:38.660> though<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.169> very<00:05:39.500> poor<00:05:39.800> very<00:05:40.100> shaky

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
quality though is very poor very shaky

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.700 
quality though is very poor very shaky
and<00:05:40.729> also<00:05:41.330> video<00:05:41.600> call<00:05:41.840> yours<00:05:42.050> no<00:05:42.169> microphones

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
and also video call yours no microphones

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.620 
and also video call yours no microphones
so<00:05:42.860> it's<00:05:43.010> gonna<00:05:43.250> be<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.820> very<00:05:44.120> lacking

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
so it's gonna be a very lacking

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.900 
so it's gonna be a very lacking
experience<00:05:45.110> there<00:05:45.320> before<00:05:45.890> basic<00:05:46.190> pics<00:05:46.640> it's

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
experience there before basic pics it's

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.520 
experience there before basic pics it's
so<00:05:47.090> better<00:05:47.300> than<00:05:47.510> any<00:05:47.660> camera<00:05:48.080> can<00:05:48.260> deliver

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
so better than any camera can deliver

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.070 
so better than any camera can deliver
which<00:05:48.890> is<00:05:49.270> something<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.390> we<00:05:50.630> didn't<00:05:50.810> expect

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
which is something that we didn't expect

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.409 
which is something that we didn't expect
for<00:05:51.200> something<00:05:51.440> like<00:05:51.850> 2001-2002<00:05:52.850> technology

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
for something like 2001-2002 technology

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.990 
for something like 2001-2002 technology
so<00:05:53.870> still<00:05:54.110> very<00:05:54.260> impressive<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.370> terms<00:05:55.850> of
