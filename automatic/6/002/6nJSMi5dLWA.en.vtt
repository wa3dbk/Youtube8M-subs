00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.309
 so we have 1,140 federici-vive and another niche already before anything else 

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.980
 that these animals live in spaces 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.250
 laid out is large enough 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.030
 for their well-being today gold zoo catching more than 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.550
 mammals in the wild the tigers the panthers with these lands are only 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.730
 more than turin would have reproduced very very well in captivity 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.990
 according to these breeding programs and for 100 m of establishments as must 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.840
 from modern logic this right to work for the backup these 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.540
 animals with regard to the tiger us here precisely we will fund some 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.860
 conservation programs in nature and in sumatra for the protection of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.220
 sumatra tigers possible in hand in india in cambodia and then russia by 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.550
 through associations that are well present in the field while at the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.880
 throughout the year in fact these are people of recognized scientists on the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.380
 field they have us their funds transfer that come either from donations of 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.880
 visitors but also bombs companies as well on the profits 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.140
 so the postman backs up in the natural environment or conservation in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 situ is a very important component today of the zoological parks there 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.750
 be aware that without zoos today the case 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 today lyon is going to be very very few protected species in the state 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.540
 wild and concerning the tiger probably one of the most 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.970
 important 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670
 in terms of funds 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.650
 leveaux so well the wwf the world bank of governments work for 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.959
 its backup but also the famous logic and for 100 m 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.470
 well on the ground following the threats he's going to see some answers 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.650
 adapted then one thing is worth noting is when we talk about logic since 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.510
 twenty years a very important job that is done for the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 safeguard 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.640
 % and saving subspecies in feline e2 eg tiger 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.610
 whereas in the ideas the circuits tends rather to make the show 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.390
 has always been hybridized and well in paleontology that today we have 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.369
 breeding programs for subspecies well determined to me 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.849
 do not bother in the nature of sumatra tigers is a little tiger 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.119
 in e insular so he has 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.899
 the morpho logically particular characters it is smaller there is a 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.150
 robles a dress 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.910
 a little more dark orange 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.580
 tighter stripes one risk the siberian tiger is more funny there 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 can go up to 200 from 150 to 300 kilos 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.710
 and the best are more spaced a little loose lighter 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.710
 and we actually have two subspecies that have adapted 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.069
 g geographical areas so there is no interest if we want to work 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.839
 actually for saving the hybrids
