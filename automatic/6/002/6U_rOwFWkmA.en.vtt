occasionally<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.079> my<00:01:21.200> rotation<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.539> it's

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
occasionally in my rotation and it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.300

little<00:01:28.219> bit<00:01:28.340> more<00:01:28.490> sensitive<00:01:28.999> I<00:01:29.240> think<00:01:29.539> then

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
little bit more sensitive I think then

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.749 
little bit more sensitive I think then
some<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.350> other<00:01:30.529> letter<00:01:30.829> leathers<00:01:31.549> on

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
some of the other letter leathers on

some of the other letter leathers on
coach<00:01:32.119> bags<00:01:32.389> and<00:01:32.630> then<00:01:33.109> it<00:01:33.259> shows<00:01:33.499> like<00:01:33.740> nicks

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
coach bags and then it shows like nicks

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.800

and<00:01:34.310> things<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:34.909> on<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.389> little<00:01:35.630> bit

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and things like that on it a little bit

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.719 
and things like that on it a little bit
more<00:01:36.079> than<00:01:36.679> some<00:01:36.709> of<00:01:37.009> their<00:01:37.099> more<00:01:37.279> durable

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
more than some of their more durable

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.539 
more than some of their more durable
leathers<00:01:38.090> it's<00:01:38.749> this<00:01:38.929> kind<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:40.369> a

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
leathers it's this kind of a it's a

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.239 
leathers it's this kind of a it's a
thick<00:01:41.029> leather<00:01:41.539> but<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.020> kind<00:01:42.469> of<00:01:42.529> soft<00:01:42.920> on

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
thick leather but it's kind of soft on

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.260 
thick leather but it's kind of soft on
the<00:01:43.340> top<00:01:43.579> if<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:43.909> makes<00:01:44.119> sense<00:01:44.389> at<00:01:44.569> all<00:01:44.689> and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
the top if that makes sense at all and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.969 
the top if that makes sense at all and
so<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.299> do<00:01:47.450> feel<00:01:47.569> like<00:01:48.079> I<00:01:48.109> had<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.469> be<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.619> little

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
so I do feel like I had to be a little

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.249 
so I do feel like I had to be a little
bit<00:01:49.130> more<00:01:49.279> careful<00:01:49.700> otherwise<00:01:50.060> things<00:01:50.929> like

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
bit more careful otherwise things like

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.779 
bit more careful otherwise things like
this<00:01:51.439> would<00:01:51.740> start<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.099> happen<00:01:52.429> to<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.579> bag

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
this would start to happen to the bag

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.819 
this would start to happen to the bag
where<00:01:53.419> it<00:01:53.569> get<00:01:53.810> rubbed<00:01:54.109> up<00:01:54.229> against<00:01:54.619> things

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
where it get rubbed up against things

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.739 
where it get rubbed up against things
and<00:01:55.189> kind<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.669> nicked<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:55.999> leather<00:01:56.209> a<00:01:56.329> bit<00:01:56.569> a

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
and kind of nicked the leather a bit a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.899 
and kind of nicked the leather a bit a
little<00:01:56.840> bit<00:01:57.009> otherwise<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.249> bag<00:01:58.429> is<00:01:58.609> held<00:01:58.789> up

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
little bit otherwise the bag is held up

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.059 
little bit otherwise the bag is held up
really<00:01:59.239> really<00:01:59.569> well<00:01:59.779> in<00:02:00.109> my<00:02:00.169> opinion<00:02:00.469> coach

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
were made and that sort of thing can

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.609 
were made and that sort of thing can
really<00:02:05.419> be<00:02:05.569> some<00:02:05.779> of<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.989> most<00:02:06.259> durable

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that's kind of a minor issue because it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.990 
that's kind of a minor issue because it
didn't<00:02:52.470> go<00:02:52.560> all<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.740> way<00:02:52.830> through<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.400> oh<00:02:53.430> no<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
didn't go all the way through so oh no I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.270 
didn't go all the way through so oh no I
would<00:02:54.150> say<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.660> has<00:02:54.720> held<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.410> really

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
would say that this has held up really

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.850 
would say that this has held up really
substantially<00:02:56.970> well<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.530> other

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
substantially well and I think other

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.280 
substantially well and I think other
than<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.340> feeling<00:02:59.700> like<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.510> be

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
than just feeling like I have to be

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.260 
than just feeling like I have to be
careful<00:03:01.830> what<00:03:02.190> kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.430> situations<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.090> get

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
careful what kind of situations I get

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.510 
careful what kind of situations I get
