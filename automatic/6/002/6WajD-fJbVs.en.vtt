00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
our map here it does change the name as
you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> top<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.700> says<00:01:53.729> spawn

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you can see at the top it says spawn

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.530 
you can see at the top it says spawn
eggs<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.829> there's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.939> trick<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> get

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
eggs so there's a little trick to get

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
eggs so there's a little trick to get
around<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> spawn

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
around that if you don't want that spawn

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.780 
around that if you don't want that spawn
eggs<00:02:00.329> name<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> top<00:02:01.430> that's<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
eggs name at the top that's just the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
eggs name at the top that's just the
name<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.240> file<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> changes<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> name

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
name of the file so it changes the name

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.170 
name of the file so it changes the name
of<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.860> map<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.729> game<00:02:05.939> breaker

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
of your map it's not a game breaker

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.429 
of your map it's not a game breaker
because<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.600> can't<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:06.899> around<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
because you can't get around it but

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.589 
because you can't get around it but
let's<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.829> into<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.450> this

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
let's go into it and as you can see this

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.809 
let's go into it and as you can see this
is<00:02:09.810> still<00:02:10.020> our<00:02:10.170> survival<00:02:10.679> mode<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:11.580> put

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
is still our survival mode it will put

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.830 
is still our survival mode it will put
you<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.330> new<00:02:12.569> location

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you in a new location

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390 
you in a new location
give<00:02:14.230> me<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.380> second<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.980> little<00:02:15.220> laggy

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
give me a second it's a little laggy

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.480 
give me a second it's a little laggy
because<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.880> trying<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.240> load<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:18.250> as<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
because it's trying to load but as you

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.410 
because it's trying to load but as you
see<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.940> my<00:02:19.090> hotbar<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.660> have<00:02:20.069> 99<00:02:21.069> plus<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.970> some

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
see in my hotbar I have 99 plus of some

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.610 
see in my hotbar I have 99 plus of some
eggs<00:02:22.620> pretty<00:02:23.620> cool<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:25.480> only<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
eggs pretty cool not only that but you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.860 
eggs pretty cool not only that but you
got<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> huge<00:02:27.220> inventory<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.940> them<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.750> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
got a huge inventory of them so you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.470 
got a huge inventory of them so you
should<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.260> able<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.500> last<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.830> while<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.220> this

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
should be able to last a while on this

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.309 
should be able to last a while on this
the<00:02:31.480> easiest<00:02:31.840> way<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.080> do<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:35.140> you

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
the easiest way to do this is if you

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.530 
the easiest way to do this is if you
want<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> change<00:02:35.830> your<00:02:36.010> name<00:02:36.130> back

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
want to change your name back

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you can basically let's get down to that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.009 
you can basically let's get down to that
chest<00:02:41.500> where<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.770> was<00:02:41.980> at<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.000> right<00:02:46.209> now<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.690> have

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
chest where I was at so right now I have

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.310 
chest where I was at so right now I have
the<00:02:47.140> spawn<00:02:47.350> eggs<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.769> leveled<00:02:48.370> app<00:02:48.700> file

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
the spawn eggs in my leveled app file

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.410 
the spawn eggs in my leveled app file
once<00:02:50.320> when<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.530> put<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.610> chest<00:02:52.090> that

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
once when you put it in a chest that

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.440 
once when you put it in a chest that
stores<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.709> an<00:02:53.860> entities<00:02:54.430> dot<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.120> file

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
stores it in an entities dot that file

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.229 
stores it in an entities dot that file
so<00:02:56.290> once<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.430> rid<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.910> items

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
so once when you get rid of the items

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.780 
so once when you get rid of the items
put<00:02:59.110> them<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.500> entities<00:03:00.040> such<00:03:00.519> as<00:03:00.550> this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
put them in the entities such as this

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.090 
put them in the entities such as this
chest<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.600> let's<00:03:02.319> make<00:03:02.470> sure<00:03:02.500> our<00:03:02.620> stuff<00:03:02.890> still

the<00:04:03.220> easiest<00:04:03.579> way<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.650> go<00:04:05.769> ahead

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
the easiest way I think is just go ahead

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.650 
the easiest way I think is just go ahead
and<00:04:06.010> create<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.280> new<00:04:06.519> survival<00:04:06.850> map<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.510> can

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
and create a new survival map you can

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.390 
and create a new survival map you can
make<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.989> same<00:04:08.170> name<00:04:08.410> like<00:04:08.709> I'll<00:04:08.920> call<00:04:09.250> it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
make it the same name like I'll call it

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.220 
make it the same name like I'll call it
the<00:04:09.940> venom<00:04:10.500> monkey<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.690> we'll<00:04:13.690> call<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
the venom monkey and we'll call it the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.900 
the venom monkey and we'll call it the
venom<00:04:14.680> monkey<00:04:14.890> 2<00:04:15.100> just<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:15.549> it's<00:04:15.730> not

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
venom monkey 2 just so it's not

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.270 
venom monkey 2 just so it's not
confusing<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.810> then<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.829> can<00:04:17.919> go<00:04:18.039> ahead<00:04:18.130> and

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
confusing and then you can go ahead and

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.219 
confusing and then you can go ahead and
create<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> world<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.870> doesn't<00:04:20.140> really

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
matter what you call it it's just

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.159 
matter what you call it it's just
whatever<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.940> want<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.210> name<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.419> be<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:23.080> so
