 Y 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.840
 there is no doubt hulk is one of the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.380
 most powerful characters in the universe 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.529
 marvel and probably one of the most 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.990
 strong within the gringo comics of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 superheroes with 1500 pounds and 2.13 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.020
 meters of altitude the green beast is a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.010
 authentic battle machine outside 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.610
 control the power of hulk is legendary 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.550
 his brute strength has been able to large 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.479
 exploits like lifting the hammer of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.409
 Thor and raze with entire armies 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:48.870
 in short hulk is a force 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.979
 virtually invincible but it is not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.250
 it really costs to count the times that the 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:00.750
 giant green has bitten the dust from 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.619
 his first appearance in 1962 and if he has 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 fact has been for a few moments but 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.369
 well something is something not 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.549
 next meet the five 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.840
 characters that have defeated hulk at 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.840
 less for a moment 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.590
 number 5 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.979
 if there is someone with enough 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.539
 intellect to contain the alter ego of 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.140
 bruce banner that's tony star and when 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.329
 even that is not enough to stop the beast 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 then he resorts to the full force of his 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.350
 super special fist which naturally 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 will use all the energy of his armor 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.329
 leaving you on the verge of collapse just like 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.310
 he did it with the hulk leaving him in knockout 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.170
 this happened in the invincible comics 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.009
 ironman number 132 back in the year one thousand 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.009
 980 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 number 4 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.760
 As a curious fact, everything was originally 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.700
 conceived by stanley as the only 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 character capable of defeating the hulk in a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.040
 combat although there has never really been 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.760
 an absolute winner 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.719
 nevertheless in the comics the incredible 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.569
 annual hulk of the year 2001 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:36.659
 Thor managed to knock out the colossus with lightning 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.450
 electric strategically pointing to 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.400
 his neck clear that it was just a matter of 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.099
 time for July 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.629
 come back to himself and well they would have to 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.629
 read them yourselves 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.790
 number 3 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 spider man and hulk have faced each other in 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 more than once having as winner 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 to the green giant as a rule without 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 However in the era of tut mcferrin 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.989
 spider-man got the urge to tell 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.260
 a victory over hulk or its version 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.240
 smarter and less powerful than 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.000
 mister fix it 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.330
 imbued with the cosmic powers of 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.970
 Captain universe spider-man was given the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.310
 luxury of sending a ride to the hulk 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.310
 planetary orbit in one fell swoop 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.000
 number 2 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.280
 in 1981 marvel and dc made a 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.370
 crossover with two of his characters more 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.500
 popular at that time that summer 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.769
 that ronald reagan sat down for the first 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.530
 time in the Batman presidential chair and 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.160
 hull also fought for the first 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.160
 Once in a combat the winner could be 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.799
 say that technically batman managed 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.590
 contain the beast making him breathe 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.900
 one of the many gases that the guardian 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.590
 of the city goti-k preserved in his 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.590
 they predicted 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.459
 number 1 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.669
 hulk and superman have had up to the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.720
 date three clashes of which 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.830
 two has won superman but really 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:34.210
 won happens that in these fights hulk not 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:38.849
 was 100% the first fight was in 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:43.030
 the cross over of the year 1976 titled 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:45.430
 spider-man versus superman here hulk 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.520
 was weakened by what was a 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.410
 pretty uneven combat the second 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.229
 fight was in another cross over the year 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.740
 1996 entitled the confrontation of 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.220
 century this combat was short of few 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.830
 pages where both characters are 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.669
 they could see very even but in the end 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:13.030
 beat superman nonetheless this version 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.330
 Hulk was the weakest of all because 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.020
 in this comics the mind of bruce banner 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.120
 was attached to the body of the green giant 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.630
 finally we come to the last 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.570
 confrontation 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.570
 and superman this was in the comics 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:34.030
 entitled 'the incredible hulk' versus 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:37.090
 superman of the year 1999 however in 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.390
 this case there is no clear winner and 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.000
 It is probably the only occasion where 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.820
 superman found himself on the edge of the knockout 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.330
 the fight ends with the alliance between 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.500
 both characters against a common evil 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.340
