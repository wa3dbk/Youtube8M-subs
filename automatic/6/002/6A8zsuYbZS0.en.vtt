00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.260 
when I met Artie it was in a homeless
shelter<00:04:31.590> in<00:04:31.950> Glendale<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.850> we<00:04:32.940> were<00:04:33.060> guest

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
shelter in Glendale and we were guest

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.480 
shelter in Glendale and we were guest
chefs<00:04:33.540> and<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.750> can't<00:04:34.020> cook<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:34.950> know<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
chefs and I can't cook so you know it

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.180 
chefs and I can't cook so you know it
was<00:04:35.610> really<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:36.000> gift<00:04:36.210> chef<00:04:36.510> situation<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
was really a gift chef situation and I

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.190 
was really a gift chef situation and I
thought<00:04:38.820> what<00:04:39.000> would<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.240> look<00:04:39.420> like<00:04:39.480> if

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
thought what would it look like if

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.500 
thought what would it look like if
everyone<00:04:41.040> just<00:04:41.300> opened<00:04:42.300> up<00:04:42.330> their

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
everyone just opened up their

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.870 
everyone just opened up their
connections<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.500> homeless<00:04:44.280> person<00:04:44.790> and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
connections to one homeless person and

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.340 
connections to one homeless person and
gave<00:04:45.030> them<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.240> leg<00:04:45.420> up<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.720> lifetime

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
gave them the leg up of a lifetime

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.550 
gave them the leg up of a lifetime
and<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:46.980> I<00:04:47.010> asked<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:48.090> friend<00:04:48.930> who<00:04:49.260> had<00:04:49.440> this
