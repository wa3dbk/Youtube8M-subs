I<00:01:45.540> don't<00:01:46.050> know<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.070> definitely<00:01:48.030> been

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I don't know it's definitely been

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.450 
I don't know it's definitely been
simplified<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> good<00:01:50.250> thing

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
simplified and that is a good thing

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
simplified and that is a good thing
because<00:01:50.640> enchanting<00:01:51.300> used<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> hell<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
because enchanting used to be a hell of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.430 
because enchanting used to be a hell of
a<00:01:52.500> grind<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.300> doggone<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.510> just<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.260> was

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
a grind and I doggone it was just it was

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.400 
a grind and I doggone it was just it was
awful<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.420> times<00:01:57.630> awful<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> do

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
awful it really was at times awful to do

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.890 
awful it really was at times awful to do
in<00:01:58.560> any<00:01:58.800> enchanting<00:01:59.430> because<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.660> know<00:02:00.750> it

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
in any enchanting because you know it

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.230 
in any enchanting because you know it
was<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.170> such<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.440> long<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.430> tedious<00:02:02.729> process

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
was just such a long and tedious process

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.910 
was just such a long and tedious process
you<00:02:03.690> know<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
you know it really really was and I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.620 
you know it really really was and I
guess<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.820> good<00:02:09.000> thing<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.600> have

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
guess it's a good thing that they have

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.050 
guess it's a good thing that they have
indeed<00:02:10.140> simplified<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> next<00:02:11.790> thing

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
indeed simplified it now the next thing

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120 
indeed simplified it now the next thing

experience<00:03:13.780> from<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.110> sit<00:03:14.680> with<00:03:14.770> iron<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
experience from it sit with iron now the

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.520 
experience from it sit with iron now the
reason<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.840> quite<00:03:17.140> simply

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
reason for that is is quite simply

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.520 
reason for that is is quite simply
because<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.430> place<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.850> down<00:03:18.970> again

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
because you can place it down again

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.840 
because you can place it down again
meaning<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.740> could<00:03:20.890> place<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.670> then

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
meaning that you could place it and then

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.460 
meaning that you could place it and then
farm<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.810> place<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.160> then<00:03:24.700> farm<00:03:25.120> it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
farm it and place it and then farm it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.670 
farm it and place it and then farm it
however<00:03:26.470> with<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:27.280> coal<00:03:27.550> block<00:03:28.140> call<00:03:29.140> or<00:03:29.380> block

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
however with a coal block call or block

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.940 
however with a coal block call or block
I<00:03:29.950> will<00:03:30.490> get<00:03:30.670> experience<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.200> if<00:03:32.350> i<00:03:32.410> change<00:03:32.709> my

to do it for example if i get myself a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.680 
to do it for example if i get myself a
furnace<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:08.760> plunk<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.850> down<00:04:09.910> for<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.239> second

Chapman lavatory no experience so

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.070 
Chapman lavatory no experience so
enchanting<00:04:40.460> has<00:04:40.610> been<00:04:40.759> nerfed<00:04:41.080> experience

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
enchanting has been nerfed experience

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050 
enchanting has been nerfed experience
has<00:04:42.199> been<00:04:42.319> simplified<00:04:42.699> what<00:04:43.699> more<00:04:43.879> could<00:04:43.999> you

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
has been simplified what more could you

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.360 
has been simplified what more could you
want<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:44.990> know<00:04:45.139> it's<00:04:45.439> a<00:04:45.740> hell<00:04:46.039> of<00:04:46.069> a<00:04:46.249> lot

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.499 
easier to get your really badass

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.159 
easier to get your really badass
enchantments<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.490> weapons<00:04:49.969> and<00:04:50.210> tools<00:04:50.870> and

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
enchantments and weapons and tools and

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.129 
enchantments and weapons and tools and
stuff<00:04:51.289> like<00:04:51.409> that<00:04:51.499> so<00:04:52.389> yeah<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:53.629> think<00:04:53.659> this<00:04:53.990> is

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
stuff like that so yeah I think this is

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.769 
stuff like that so yeah I think this is
a<00:04:54.169> good<00:04:54.409> step<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:55.009> think<00:04:55.599> chanting<00:04:56.599> was<00:04:56.750> a

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:56.779 
a good step I think chanting was a

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.110 
a good step I think chanting was a
little<00:04:57.319> bit<00:04:57.469> too<00:04:57.650> grindy<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.580> has<00:04:58.789> needed

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
little bit too grindy and it has needed

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640 
little bit too grindy and it has needed
