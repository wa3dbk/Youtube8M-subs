00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 the true truth is that an airplane that 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.210
 has five months in a company 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.559
 making it a overall responsibility 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.559
 airbus de france 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 do not come now is what we call here in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.500
 venezuela drain the bulk 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.539
 the responsibility for contract before the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.849
 Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.750
 the presidential plane is from airbus 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.309
 France that simple and I'm going to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.780
 prove legally in the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.690
 instances that I am going to demonstrate 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.490
 five months mate I see first time in 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.290
 the story that the presidential plane 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.360
 it was practically the days 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.760
 in which we take to his last abode here 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.500
 on the mountain in the barracks of the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.210
 mountain that is the chávez commander to the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 front 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.240
 it was practically in those days that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 it was called over hole 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.220
 the deep maintenance as they had 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.650
 spent twelve years then the verses we 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.720
 they explained was going to be more of more time 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.260
 it was not two months it lasted five months 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.659
 five months 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.729
 and when I arrive I do not know 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.079
 and something like a hunch came to me 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.079
 in the body of not being wise 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 and I said do the tests thoroughly 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.880
 good all the tests that are 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.759
 we hold experts we have engineers 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.619
 prepared for all this and so it was done 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.780
 a serious fault was discovered that I did not 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.689
 I said what it is and the spokesperson for the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 company airbus qualifies that failure is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.360
 normal to appear to aircraft 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 says he has said what is the flaw that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480
 I have it in the report of the experts 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.180
 I did not say 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.040
 that's why the spokesman is serious what he said 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 from the erbol company I said what is 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.390
 the fault for him to say that it is normal 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.759
 and that statement that the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.130
 afp and efe agencies 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 as an official statement say this to the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.240
 company 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.160
 but also good this fault appears 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.690
 so serious we bring some experts 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.130
 international to verify and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.130
 certify what we are doing 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.230
 but also we later with the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.510
 networks of national intelligence 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.410
 international we collect things from this 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.290
 right 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 calculating things 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.939
 they knew what to take on a trip 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.939
 long to china they were calculating something 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.760
 they are analyzes that one makes 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 complementary to an objective fact that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 an airplane that was five months in 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.350
 repair came with a very serious fault 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.470
 in one wing of that plane at least one 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.570
 fails to detect because we stopped the plane 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.280
 maybe if we continue testing him 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.680
 we got another flaw first time 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.030
 companions 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.600
 and they are tiring me 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.420
 and I'm not rabbit 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.520
 they are hunting me 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.770
 because they think to get out of the way 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.060
 a nicolás mature is the end of the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.160
 Bolivarian revolution 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.400
 they do not know the village of Xavi the people 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.230
 of bolívar do not know what is capable of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.010
 make this revolutionary armed force 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.040
 that we have and this people united 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.920
 It will not happen because we are in hands 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.510
 of God we are in the hands of God here I 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.659
 I have the medal that dad gave me 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.659
 Francisco 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.270
 protective medal with redeeming Christ and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.200
 san francisco de asís because we are 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.200
 protected by god
