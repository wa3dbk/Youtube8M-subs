00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.440
 Maracas today would like to show you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 top of the best heavy tanks in the eighth 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 level and immediately want to warn you that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 This rating is based on my personal experience. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.180
 this is my opinion I am by no means him 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 I do not impose on the contrary, I think 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.100
 that every person should have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.650
 own opinion and everyone should 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.109
 be favorite tank but nevertheless i 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.980
 I think this video should 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.560
 to please 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 it will not be useful in eighth place 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 we have a British tank 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 caernarvon he has an exact 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 fire and piercing gun 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 which shows itself well when 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 shooting long distances but with 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.510
 This is what the tank does not have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 always succeed because 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 caernarvon tank is big and sometimes it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 hard to hide and it always glows 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.210
 so play like pt-sau 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.420
 you are unlikely to succeed but only if 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 very far away from the enemy to be 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 the same tank is not very fast and occupy 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.830
 some interesting positions are not always 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
 can the British have armor in some places 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 pretty strong 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.799
 especially worth noting the forehead of the tower and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 well booked vlde 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.270
 but in general, all the same many vulnerabilities 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 on the big nld tower and in general tank 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.189
 punching is not a problem the main thing is to know him 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 vulnerabilities then even with a breakthrough 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.540
 175 on he makes his way well and worth 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 note that very often breaks 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.790
 ammunition and to me personally it is very strong 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 did not like the seventh place in our 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.869
 ranking takes 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 alpha sneakers and the German have guns with 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920
 breaking through 200 is not the best 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.380
 indicator 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.770
 who is not always enough alpha strike 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.430
 then 320 is not bad in principle, but 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.970
 scatter is not the best 037 time 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.130
 information 2 and 3 fast dpm at the tank 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.830
 good overall gun so good 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.860
 the alpha sneaker armor is not that bad 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.410
 she may still take some kind of blow from 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.720
 tanks with high penetration 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.880
 more than two hundred penetration already punches 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.209
 pretty confident even if you bet 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.400
 big diamond in general I would not 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.970
 count especially armor on this 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.730
 tanke 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.590
 would play more neat because 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.810
 large size this tank is often 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 suffers when falls against ninth 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.230
 a dozen 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.049
 as for speed that alpha sneaker 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 good maximum speed 38 kilometers per hour 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.510
 at set speed pretty fast like 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.670
 for heavy duty and good turning speed 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.360
 chassis 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.090
 28 overall dynamics when for heavy duty 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.819
 principle acceptable in sixth place 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.359
 We are located in the Soviet tanks 4 y 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.930
 he has a weapon with a good break through 226 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.810
 with a good alpha strike m320 but dpm 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.660
 here so so 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.810
 038 scatter accuracy is pretty much 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.780
 and a very long time information 34 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.480
 but in general, a good gun go to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.180
 booking this monster as a whole armor 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.340
 who has 4 pretty strong 180 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.220
 millimeters in the forehead of the tower as much in 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.620
 the forehead of the case but it is worth noting that in the forehead 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.230
 a lot of vulnerabilities such as 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.170
 for example nld hatch mechvoda 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.720
 machine gun nest and also this one 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.940
 big turret on the main tower but 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.950
 if the players correctly put the tank 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.530
 With a diamond, you can partially 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 disadvantages level is also worth 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.690
 note that 4 of them are very durable 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.780
 bead 150 millimeters allowing 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.810
 effectively tank them speed anyone 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.920
 4 low because the tank is very large 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.710
 weighs 110 tons and in general there on it 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.200
 especially not ride 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.710
 and of course someone 4 is very vulnerable from 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.080
 fast cars as well as from art and fri-sau and 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.390
 Fifth place in our ranking is 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.230
 royal tiger there is good 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.420
 breaking through 225 small info strike 320 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.380
 units but in principle it is not so 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.410
 few also have mediocre dpm by 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.620
 my opinion he is inferior to many of his 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.230
 classmates accuracy is good here 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.380
 the spread is only 034 and a very fast time 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.510
 mixing 2 and 5 as a whole the gun is excellent 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.990
 suitable for shooting on 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.170
 long distance armor of a cat worthy 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.120
 150 millimeters valdai and if set 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.580
 a rhombus tank then you can effectively 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.590
 to tank against eights well sometimes 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.780
 against the nines of 185 millimeters forehead towers 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.340
 in principle, it is also quite strong 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.070
 the tower but still 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.760
 because of a bad slope there are 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.160
 punch it pretty easy bartak 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.860
 cardboard 180 millimeters 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.620
 sometimes you can tank them but 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.440
 in general, I advise you not to substitute their enemies 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.660
 A weak point can be considered as if 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.640
 the enemy goes there and there is a chance 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.070
 the fact that he will wait for you because 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.550
 tank front transmission layout 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.180
 also a weak point is of course whether choke 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.000
 the tower 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.010
 but as a whole the tiger can tank but 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.680
 Naturally not very good against 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.140
 nines and especially against tens 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.110
 who generally punch him easily 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.600
 tigers speed good 38 kilometers 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.760
 forward and 12 back 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.820
 but mostly tiger for its maximum 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.070
 rarely accelerates for speed 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.740
 gaining pretty fast yes and in general 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.960
 peppy tank turns very quickly 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.970
 28 chassis turning speed 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.380
 which is very good for me personally 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.810
 a significant disadvantage of this tank i 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.900
 I think its size is pretty big and 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.030
 Therefore, it is easy to get and against 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.910
 ninth dozen it means a lot 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.160
 and so friends i decided i would do the second one 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.510
 part of this video later because 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.210
 I'm tired now and want to sleep 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.820
 I hope for understanding and very soon you 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.540
 see the top four heavy tanks 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.790
 In my opinion, I hope the first part of you 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.490
 I liked it and you did not dislike it and 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.260
 all the same I do not impose my own on anyone 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.750
 opinion and believe that every person 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.630
 your taste and he should choose tanks under 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.460
 yourself but nevertheless this video should 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.980
 help newcomers choosing 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.440
 and on this all friends thank you so much 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.630
 what you watched hope this video you 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.360
 liked do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.640
 on the channel and put likes I wish you all 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.140
 the best with you was marks asya 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.140
 see you soon friends bye
