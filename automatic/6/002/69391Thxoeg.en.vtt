00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.640 

okay<00:00:01.709> so<00:00:01.770> there<00:00:02.070> are<00:00:02.220> two<00:00:02.700> ways<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:04.049> test<00:00:04.350> your

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay so there are two ways to test your

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.869 
okay so there are two ways to test your
app<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:05.069> your<00:00:05.279> phone

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
app on your phone

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.780 
app on your phone
one<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.540> through<00:00:06.750> Xcode<00:00:07.440> by<00:00:07.950> plugging<00:00:08.460> your

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
one is through Xcode by plugging your

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360 
one is through Xcode by plugging your
phone<00:00:09.150> into<00:00:09.540> your<00:00:09.870> computer<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.530> selecting

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
phone into your computer and selecting

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.900 
phone into your computer and selecting
your<00:00:11.400> device<00:00:11.910> instead<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> emulator<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
your device instead of the emulator and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.220 
your device instead of the emulator and
this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> great<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.420> testing<00:00:16.080> during

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
this is great for testing during

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.450 
this is great for testing during
development<00:00:17.070> however<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:18.270> you're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:19.460> once

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
development however if you're going once

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
development however if you're going once
you're<00:00:20.609> getting<00:00:20.910> closer<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> tripping<00:00:22.439> your

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
you're getting closer to tripping your

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
you're getting closer to tripping your
app<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.949> should<00:00:23.160> consider<00:00:23.519> creating<00:00:23.939> an

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
app you should consider creating an

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.529 
app you should consider creating an
archive<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.960> your<00:00:25.109> app<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.250> dot<00:00:26.699> IPA

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
archive of your app which is a dot IPA

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.750 
archive of your app which is a dot IPA
file<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.320> installing<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.429> device

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
file and installing that on your device

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
file and installing that on your device
for<00:00:30.029> testing<00:00:30.260> this<00:00:31.260> gives<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> same

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
for testing this gives you the same

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
for testing this gives you the same
experience<00:00:32.300> your<00:00:33.300> users<00:00:33.750> will<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.930> when

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
experience your users will have when

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.549 
experience your users will have when
they<00:00:34.410> download<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> app<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.969> App<00:00:36.120> Store

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
they download the app from the App Store

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
they download the app from the App Store
and<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.190> sometimes<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.700> different<00:00:39.210> than

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and this can sometimes be different than

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330 
and this can sometimes be different than
what<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.719> were<00:00:40.200> seeing<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.950> were<00:00:41.160> doing

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
what you were seeing when you were doing

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
what you were seeing when you were doing
it<00:00:41.520> straight<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:41.969> Xcode<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it straight from Xcode or in the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.100 
it straight from Xcode or in the
emulator<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.219> important<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:45.110> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
emulator so it's important to do I

emulator so it's important to do I
recently<00:00:46.559> went<00:00:46.920> through<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.340> process<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.480> my

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
recently went through this process on my

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.260 
recently went through this process on my
latest<00:00:48.989> app<00:00:49.170> called<00:00:49.710> touch<00:00:50.070> screen<00:00:50.850> text

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
latest app called touch screen text

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.709 
latest app called touch screen text
which<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.500> find<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> App<00:00:53.160> Store<00:00:53.190> now

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
which you can find on the App Store now

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.529 
which you can find on the App Store now
the<00:00:54.719> link<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.170> below<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> description<00:00:56.539> but

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the link is below in the description but

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.010 
the link is below in the description but
anyway

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
anyway

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
anyway
so<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> create<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> archive

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
so to do this to create this archive

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
so to do this to create this archive
file<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.800> Xcode<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.290> need<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
file in Xcode and you need to have the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
file in Xcode and you need to have the
emulator<00:01:05.489> set<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> iOS<00:01:06.420> device<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> do

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
emulator set to iOS device when you do

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.060 
emulator set to iOS device when you do
this<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.430> product<00:01:08.939> archive<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.070> after

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this so you go product archive and after

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240 
this so you go product archive and after
it<00:01:11.250> builds<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> archive<00:01:12.710> organizer<00:01:13.710> should

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it builds the archive organizer should

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
it builds the archive organizer should

that in the description as well then you

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.789 
that in the description as well then you
save<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.820> IPA<00:01:54.570> file<00:01:54.899> somewhere<00:01:55.289> you<00:01:55.649> will

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
save the IPA file somewhere you will

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.700 
save the IPA file somewhere you will
remember<00:01:56.720> on<00:01:57.720> your<00:01:57.869> desktop<00:01:58.289> or<00:01:58.500> somewhere
