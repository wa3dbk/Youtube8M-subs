one<00:01:17.369> day<00:01:17.549> sitting<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.119> desk<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.540> just

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
one day sitting at my desk I just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
one day sitting at my desk I just
thought<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.740> opposite<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
thought what would be the opposite of

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.780 
thought what would be the opposite of
this<00:01:20.729> music<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.080> most

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
this music what would be the most

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.350 
this music what would be the most
connected<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.330> our<00:01:24.810> bodies<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:26.700> music<00:01:27.210> could

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
connected to our bodies that music could

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.499 
connected to our bodies that music could
be<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> music<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> seems<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
be would be the music that seems like it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.710 
be would be the music that seems like it
comes<00:01:30.930> completely<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.939> within<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
comes completely from within and then I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.719 
comes completely from within and then I
just<00:01:33.960> thought<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.140> well<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:35.640> about

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
just thought about well what about

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
just thought about well what about

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
quality out of their performing but then

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.400 
quality out of their performing but then
introducing<00:02:42.000> something<00:02:42.300> into<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> mix<00:02:43.140> um

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
introducing something into the mix um

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.680 
introducing something into the mix um
chaos<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.040> makes<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> let<00:02:45.390> go<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
chaos and makes them have to let go of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.140 
chaos and makes them have to let go of
some<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.930> their<00:02:46.200> control<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.000> becomes

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
some of their control and so it becomes

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.090 
some of their control and so it becomes
this<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:49.110> becomes<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.560> little<00:02:49.650> bit<00:02:49.799> looser<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
this it becomes a little bit looser a

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.440 
this it becomes a little bit looser a
little<00:02:50.340> bit<00:02:50.430> rougher<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.940> edges

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
little bit rougher around the edges

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
little bit rougher around the edges
I<00:02:54.980> actually<00:02:55.980> what<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> wanted<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
I actually what I wanted was the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.000 
I actually what I wanted was the
performance<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.810> feel<00:02:58.049> slightly<00:02:58.350> interfered

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
performance to feel slightly interfered

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.210 
performance to feel slightly interfered
with<00:02:59.160> by<00:02:59.819> an<00:03:00.000> impulse<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.900> by<00:03:01.410> an<00:03:01.650> intuition

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
with by an impulse and by an intuition

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.009 
with by an impulse and by an intuition
that<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.579> deeper<00:03:03.090> than<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.450> musical<00:03:03.810> training

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
that is deeper than the musical training

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.509 
that is deeper than the musical training
of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.380> people<00:03:04.590> playing<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:06.799> started<00:03:07.799> writing

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
of the people playing it started writing
