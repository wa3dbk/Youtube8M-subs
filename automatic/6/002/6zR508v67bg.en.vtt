it actually goes through the bottom and
out<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.200> still<00:01:10.470> very

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
out the back so it is still very

keeps the Cotter out of the way because

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
keeps the Cotter out of the way because
as<00:01:49.740> he<00:01:49.890> imagine<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.640> five<00:01:50.939> different

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have had to either have them alternate

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
have had to either have them alternate
and<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.799> each<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.219> completes<00:01:56.610> charging

and as each one completes charging

and as each one completes charging
switch<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> charge<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.799> one

by one or have five different micro USB
cables<00:02:02.130> coming<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:02.969> outlet<00:02:03.420> which

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cables coming out of one outlet which

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
cables coming out of one outlet which
could<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.829> very<00:02:05.009> chaotic<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> just

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
could get very chaotic and it just

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
could get very chaotic and it just
doesn't<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.229> aside<00:02:07.680> from<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
doesn't look good but aside from the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
doesn't look good but aside from the
massive<00:02:08.429> price<00:02:08.700> tag<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.690> feel<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
massive price tag that I do not feel it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
massive price tag that I do not feel it
is<00:02:10.170> worth<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:10.800> personal<00:02:11.370> opinion<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
is worth it in my personal opinion I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.430 
is worth it in my personal opinion I
think<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> power<00:02:12.629> dock<00:02:12.959> 5

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
think that the power dock 5

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
think that the power dock 5
performs<00:02:13.800> amazingly<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.120> actually

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
performs amazingly and it is actually

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.820 
performs amazingly and it is actually
something<00:02:15.660> I've<00:02:15.960> been<00:02:15.990> looking<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.650> for

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
something I've been looking for for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.320

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
quite a while and solved quite a few

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.300 
quite a while and solved quite a few
problems<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.840> mine<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.980> big

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
problems of mine but it's not not a big
