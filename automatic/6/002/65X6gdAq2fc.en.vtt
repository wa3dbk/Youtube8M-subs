00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:18.119
 wow there a ray guys think to use 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 You and the group play commented and we have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.490
 new meters because we have three more 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.640
 because it is actually one of the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.560
 first is that a partner only 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 is to attract separate singles 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 but they are phases that continuation of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.440
 and the third inep can also be 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 considered a continuation of the other in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 all inep are continuations of the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 others, but without losing much time 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 speaking let's go to the 3 neps 0 13 320 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340
 yesterday ended up not taking it for granted 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 today and just follow it I'll put it together 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.399
 my grandchildren as I said since they 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.399
 are follow-ups for you to check 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.940
 week get away to the right money by joining 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.790
 so the two neps we have the following 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 doctor's sentence salema experiments already 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 are underway with a new set of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.400
 of soldiers physiology similar 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 different environmental conditions amb leza 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 come on 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.560
 this continues our contention that some 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 thing is happening one kind of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 experiment is the secret project tal 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 being done on some soldiers 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 now he has confirmed for the people who 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.180
 is being done on soldiers he talks about 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 a new set of soldiers and soon 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.439
 then he says that the physiology of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.630
 soldiers is similar but we have 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.579
 different environmental conditions 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 I think what he meant if that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.479
 The phrase was that it is even in different 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.329
 environmental conditions the physiology of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.399
 soldiers will remain the same and after 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.680
 such an experiment is not 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.810
 one of the rumors that was pointed out by 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 that leaked guy that we will not have 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.549
 more on goal in front of everything else was 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.320
 than these new mechanical parts than 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.210
 we would have in those robotic parts 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 who is thinking that it is precisely 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.799
 this project returned to food is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.470
 doing what they would give to the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.569
 soldiers is survivability 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.470
 in extreme situations in conditions 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.410
 environmental 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.510
 extreme environmental conditions and apparently 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 confirm this sentence, this is one more 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 clue t-shirt is passing is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 leaving the clue is greater than the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.100
 people can really trust that 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.930
 face that really what he said is 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.480
 these experiments. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.000
 projects are really to an implant 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.980
 robotic parts or something of the type in the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.630
 soldiers sure that we will not have 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.200
 even from abou diaby and neither is it said 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.500
 cameron 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.390
 in this background ok game the images are not 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.360
 there is much that if observed we can 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.880
 to notice are people lying down suffering 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.680
 supposed surgery something just wanted to highlight 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.060
 here in the first inep is not the three 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.310
 first seconds 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 we have a guy lying down and have a 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.500
 species of one of a new spot but 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.270
 finally a trace something so shining from the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.250
 corner of the screen and taking the image of 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.870
 background I 'm not sure that this can 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.760
 But it could mean something. 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.190
 hiding there, right? 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.230
 but it is shining in relation to the whole 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.340
 all the rest of the image is as much as 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.190
 intriguing to me 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.440
 Let's go to the other one and maps it out 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.239
 then and if longer with a phrase 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.690
 much larger and much clearer including 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:27.650
 He has ten seconds confirmed and 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:34.530
 germany x saints difficult and only after 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.910
 One touch, let's go in that one inept 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.310
 doctor sa book talks all the time 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.019
 including talking is things up to a bit 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.750
 difficult to decipher but what 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.420
 he spoke was the following after small 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.209
 with functions the subject of 2 reported a 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.580
 brief period of hearing impairment 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.850
 in the same way, 5 complained 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.890
 decreased taste sensation right 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.010
 so basically what he is talking about 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.320
 is that in these two subjects in those 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.440
 two soldiers were theoretically 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.220
 been tested baptized 2 and 5 and there 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.350
 some kind of reaction, right? 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 it is about these tests on these 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.840
 all things being done 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.180
 in them, the first of them had a brief 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.549
 the hearing loss period and the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.030
 another complained of a decrease in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.690
 It 's a palate sensation , but only one is 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.210
 so let's say small consequences 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.490
 one of them even was up to is brief 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.980
 the period that he spoke not be she was 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.750
 quickly passed the taste sensation perhaps 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.250
 continued, did not say it was brief 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.670
 and said that there was a decrease only 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.220
 Did not say if it was fast or not but anyway 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.040
 anyway they are small sequels 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.110
 this already gives a perspective 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.820
 difference for us because we 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.350
 meters and I was assuming that something 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.290
 worse that could happen, maybe even 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.300
 death of the patient since the image was 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.610
 all red and gave the impression that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.890
 something had really happened 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.450
 already in this inep is not the image does not change 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.490
 color in no time we can see 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.800
 some nurses some patients 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.110
 lying down, what draws attention 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.570
 in this image of these nep is that 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.640
 apparently the scene is a shot not 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.320
 seems modern maybe the filter 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.150
 they put the inep and everything else 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.430
 but I do not even know the clothes of 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.740
 the nurse and the place and if I 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.540
 feel of an old place not a 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.330
 modern place that theoretically is 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.670
 strange since it's all this thing would have 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.960
 to happen in the future if the 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.090
 the year the game really takes place 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.010
 it may even be that there is a timeline one 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.600
 shot of the game just as it happens in the box 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.360
 2 is that the game takes place in the greater future 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.580
 part but we have is time lines in the past 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.350
 but for this case it is not necessary 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.110
 experience thing had to have been 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.580
 done in the future and even believe that 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.919
 been made can only be an impression 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.930
 that I had that has nothing to do with it 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.980
 really the image filter 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.410
 but we do not have much to take 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.570
 outside it has nothing hidden or 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.700
 kind of thing as soon as we can 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.410
 withdraw from these grandchildren are beginning to 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.419
 become increasingly clear 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.370
 Is this really what we know? 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.930
 behind all this when we go 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.240
 have the confirmation that they are parties or 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.270
 implanted in the soldier if it is 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.190
 it really is right and and what the doctor 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.930
 It's in this story because 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.940
 is already starting to paint a little more 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.470
 as a villain was not even starting to 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.700
 to think that he was not a villain that he 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.520
 someone who is there to help 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.230
 the soldiers but it is maybe he is a 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.210
 villain or maybe he's someone 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.500
 government contractor noticed content 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.080
 the government that is working with 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.790
 These soldiers are turning out to be a 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.890
 confusion at the same time as things 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.270
 They are beginning to prove comment 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.860
 below you think 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.280
 where is it all going to take and what is the role 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.780
 of the saline doctor in the middle of this story 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.670
 more clear snow you will see a summary 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.020
 everything in the channel that you are 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.420
 like you please do not forget to leave 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.340
 the fan of you and also the favorite to 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.960
 compensate to value the work that comes 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.060
 bringing you here he was 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.880
 Staying here is a hug to everyone. 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.880
 God is even souls.
