look<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> external<00:00:48.930> model<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
look at the external model of the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.310 
look at the external model of the
aircraft<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> external

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
aircraft as you can see the external

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
aircraft as you can see the external
model<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.670> done<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.360> can

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
model is very well done that's can

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.930 
model is very well done that's can
always<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.320> expected<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.039> pmdg<00:00:57.379> pmdg

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
always be expected from pmdg pmdg

actually started back on fly the old

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.410 
actually started back on fly the old
competitor<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> microsoft<00:01:03.780> flight<00:01:03.930> sim<00:01:04.379> and

competitor to microsoft flight sim and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
competitor to microsoft flight sim and
they<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.510> since<00:01:06.750> moved<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> fsx<00:01:07.560> since

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
they have since moved to fsx since

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
they have since moved to fsx since
that's<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> only<00:01:08.840> simulator<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.110> really

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that's the only simulator that's really

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.670 
that's the only simulator that's really
still<00:01:10.710> surviving<00:01:11.280> today<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:12.090> than<00:01:12.680> fs2004

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
still surviving today other than fs2004

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
etc fly died a long time ago it seems or

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.690 
etc fly died a long time ago it seems or
maybe<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.150> few<00:01:18.360> guys<00:01:18.509> playing<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> still<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
maybe a few guys playing it still but

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.679 
maybe a few guys playing it still but
not<00:01:20.700> many<00:01:21.979> as<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> model<00:01:24.570> itself

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
not many as you can see the model itself

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
not many as you can see the model itself
is<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:25.650> done<00:01:25.860> they've<00:01:26.340> modeled<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is very well done they've modeled the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
is very well done they've modeled the
wings<00:01:27.390> flexing<00:01:28.290> during<00:01:28.740> landings<00:01:29.159> and

for<00:01:42.479> either<00:01:42.570> side<00:01:43.909> also<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.060> fully<00:01:45.360> modeled

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
for either side also they fully modeled

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.969 
for either side also they fully modeled
the<00:01:46.680> flaps<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> again<00:01:49.409> they've<00:01:49.619> done<00:01:49.860> an

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the flaps and again they've done an

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.139 
the flaps and again they've done an
excellent<00:01:50.310> job<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:52.280> all<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> animations

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
excellent job with all of the animations

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
excellent job with all of the animations
are<00:01:54.270> all<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.600> smooth<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> aircraft

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
are all very smooth some out on aircraft

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940 
are all very smooth some out on aircraft
it<00:01:56.640> seems<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.590> animations<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.770> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it seems that the animations are not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.789 
it seems that the animations are not
very<00:01:59.159> smooth<00:01:59.520> they're<00:01:59.759> very<00:01:59.939> jerky<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.840> with

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
very smooth they're very jerky not with

this airplane this airplanes animations
are<00:02:04.229> extremely<00:02:04.950> smooth<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.790> see

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
are extremely smooth that you can see

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.150 
are extremely smooth that you can see

the box we're going to go inside and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.910 
the box we're going to go inside and
look<00:02:37.380> at<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:39.050> lighting<00:02:40.050> package<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.830> go

look at the lighting package and go

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.460 
look at the lighting package and go
ahead<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.160> flip<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:42.110> there's<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> sneak

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
ahead and flip it on there's a sneak

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.710 
ahead and flip it on there's a sneak
peek<00:02:43.710> at<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> cabin<00:02:44.420> we'll<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.690> that

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
peek at the cabin we'll get to that

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:55.339 
peek at the cabin we'll get to that
later

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.369 

alrighty<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:56.680> here's<00:02:57.599> flaps<00:02:58.599> fold<00:02:58.870> down<00:02:59.079> with

as<00:03:13.450> far<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:13.870> animations<00:03:15.510> obviously<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
as far as animations obviously the

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.960 
as far as animations obviously the
things<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.019> showed<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.190> speed<00:03:18.459> brakes<00:03:18.760> are

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
things I showed you the speed brakes are

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.229 
things I showed you the speed brakes are
fully<00:03:19.180> animated<00:03:19.659> coming<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.290> they're<00:03:21.239> fully

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
fully animated coming up they're fully

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.580 
fully animated coming up they're fully
animated<00:03:22.359> thrust<00:03:23.019> reversers<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.230> again

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
animated thrust reversers and again

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.360 
animated thrust reversers and again
there's<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.920> delay<00:03:27.690> turning<00:03:28.690> them<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.959> or<00:03:29.170> off

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
there's a delay turning them on or off

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.610 
there's a delay turning them on or off
again<00:03:30.370> pmdg<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.420> unique<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.230> fact<00:03:32.260> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
again pmdg is unique in the fact that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.910 
again pmdg is unique in the fact that
they<00:03:32.950> code<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> lot<00:03:34.389> of<00:03:34.510> aircraft<00:03:34.989> outside<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
they code a lot of aircraft outside the
