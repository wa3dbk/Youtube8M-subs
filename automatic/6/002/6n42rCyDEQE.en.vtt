to<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.750> ogle<00:01:45.020> Isis<00:01:45.469> it's<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:45.920> hard<00:01:46.189> wearing

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
to the ogle Isis it's a hard wearing

to the ogle Isis it's a hard wearing
carbon<00:01:47.270> chew<00:01:47.719> because<00:01:48.500> when<00:01:48.619> you've<00:01:48.740> got

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
carbon chew because when you've got

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.319 
carbon chew because when you've got
tighter<00:01:49.130> tolerance<00:01:49.610> between<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.090> sections

tighter tolerance between the sections

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.899 
tighter tolerance between the sections
it's<00:01:51.170> going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.469> be<00:01:51.590> obviously<00:01:52.009> prone<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.700> more

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
it's going to be obviously prone to more

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.429 
it's going to be obviously prone to more
where<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.049> very<00:01:54.079> much<00:01:54.409> a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
where so it's a very much a

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
wear-resistant carbon the Swift range

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.359 
wear-resistant carbon the Swift range
either<00:01:59.750> comes<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.140> either<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.380> 35<00:02:00.890> foot<00:02:00.920> pole

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
either comes in either a 35 foot pole

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.320 
either comes in either a 35 foot pole
for<00:02:02.030> 25<00:02:02.360> foot<00:02:02.659> or<00:02:03.079> 65<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.729> new<00:02:07.850> transverse

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
for 25 foot or 65 so the new transverse

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.749 
for 25 foot or 65 so the new transverse
clamp<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.840> can<00:02:08.989> actually<00:02:09.170> either<00:02:09.860> open<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.580> to

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
clamp you can actually either open it to

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.640 
clamp you can actually either open it to
the<00:02:10.879> left<00:02:11.120> or<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.840> actually<00:02:11.959> reverse<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the left or you can actually reverse the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
the left or you can actually reverse the
clamp<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> right<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.890> got<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> wider<00:02:16.910> is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
clamp to the right it's got a wider is

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.479 
clamp to the right it's got a wider is
clamping<00:02:17.930> over<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> wider<00:02:18.500> surface<00:02:18.890> area

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
clamping over a wider surface area

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.180 
clamping over a wider surface area
obviously<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.989> clamp<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.440> reduced<00:02:22.010> size

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
obviously the the clamp is reduced size

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.240 
obviously the the clamp is reduced size
obviously<00:02:22.610> reduced<00:02:23.060> weight<00:02:23.329> so<00:02:24.319> when<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
obviously reduced weight so when the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:47.540 
obviously reduced weight so when the
pole<00:02:25.569> eventually<00:02:27.220> collapsed<00:02:30.040> lately

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.730 

mr.<00:02:48.550> reduced<00:02:48.940> length<00:02:49.210> over<00:02:49.960> his<00:02:50.050> replacement

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
mr. reduced length over his replacement

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.530 
mr. reduced length over his replacement
by<00:02:50.860> about<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.190> foot<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.670> half<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.390> not

to be able to adjust the clamps and on
this<00:03:18.220> clamp<00:03:18.580> you've<00:03:18.790> got<00:03:18.940> plenty<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.390> room<00:03:19.600> for

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
this clamp you've got plenty of room for

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.830 
this clamp you've got plenty of room for
adjustment<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.610> then<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.360> clamps<00:03:22.570> are

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
adjustment so then that the clamps are

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.360 
adjustment so then that the clamps are
going<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.200> last<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.590> life<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.100> tubes

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
going to last the life of the tubes

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.020 
going to last the life of the tubes
rather<00:03:24.790> than<00:03:24.880> having<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.180> replace<00:03:27.030> you'll

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
rather than having to replace you'll

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.490 
rather than having to replace you'll
need<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.210> take<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> clamp<00:03:28.900> off<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.230> put<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.380> the

trolley<00:05:07.700> doesn't<00:05:08.700> have<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.850> pump<00:05:09.150> so<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.620> a

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
trolley doesn't have a pump so it's a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.410 
trolley doesn't have a pump so it's a
bladder<00:05:10.950> system<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:11.910> were<00:05:12.030> able<00:05:12.150> to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
bladder system so you were able to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.140 
bladder system so you were able to
actually<00:05:12.920> automatically<00:05:13.920> fill<00:05:14.220> fill<00:05:14.940> the

tank up when the tank is actually full
closed<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.840> valve<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.410> then<00:05:19.650> you're<00:05:19.890> able<00:05:20.100> to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
closed the valve and then you're able to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.330 
closed the valve and then you're able to
take<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.300> on<00:05:21.510> two<00:05:21.660> sides<00:05:21.810> open<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.800> valve<00:05:23.010> and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
take it on two sides open the valve and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.450 
take it on two sides open the valve and
I'll<00:05:24.030> give<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.300> about<00:05:24.450> 20<00:05:24.870> minutes<00:05:25.080> cleaning

residential window cleaning where you

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.370 
residential window cleaning where you
cannot<00:05:30.270> park<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.900> street<00:05:30.960> where<00:05:31.260> he

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
cannot park on the street where he

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.050

wanted to clean the windows able to pass

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.870 
wanted to clean the windows able to pass
on<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.590> down<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.710> road<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.190> able<00:05:35.550> then<00:05:35.670> just

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
on the down the road and able then just

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.330 
on the down the road and able then just
to<00:05:35.970> take<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.240> quicker<00:05:36.690> trolley<00:05:37.020> with<00:05:37.230> them

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.210 

so<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.120> combination<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.020> profile<00:05:42.919> flag

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
so the combination of a profile flag

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.010 
so the combination of a profile flag
stops<00:05:43.520> even<00:05:43.730> able<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.449> either<00:05:46.720> use<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.750> as<00:05:47.990> a
