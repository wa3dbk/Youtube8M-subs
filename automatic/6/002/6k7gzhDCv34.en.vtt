00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.140 
that and it's come to here so it doesn't
like<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.470> only<00:02:21.620> option<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.489> we've

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
like this is the only option that we've

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.140 
like this is the only option that we've
got<00:02:23.560> i'm<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.860> try<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.340> couple<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.000> other

got i'm going to try a couple of other
supply<00:02:26.599> things<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.709> i'm<00:02:28.549> thinking<00:02:28.790> out<00:02:29.120> to

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
supply things that i'm thinking out to

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.059 
supply things that i'm thinking out to
see<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.319> will<00:02:30.439> give<00:02:30.650> us<00:02:30.680> any<00:02:31.099> more<00:02:33.069> really

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
see if it will give us any more really

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.880 
see if it will give us any more really
the<00:02:34.189> only<00:02:34.310> issue<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.269> though<00:02:35.659> that<00:02:35.829> sort<00:02:36.829> of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
the only issue is though that sort of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.039 
the only issue is though that sort of
amongst<00:02:37.189> this<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.609> these<00:02:37.760> efforts<00:02:38.120> nothing

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
amongst this all these efforts nothing

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.530 
amongst this all these efforts nothing
is<00:02:39.260> appearing<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.680> screen<00:02:40.150> now<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> would<00:02:41.420> have

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
is appearing on screen now I would have

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.129 
is appearing on screen now I would have
thought<00:02:42.099> maybe<00:02:43.099> at<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> moment<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.510> might

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
thought maybe at the moment it might

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.160 
thought maybe at the moment it might
have<00:02:45.290> had<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.069> connect<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> itunes<00:02:47.049> symbol<00:02:48.049> on

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
have had the connect to itunes symbol on

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.619 
have had the connect to itunes symbol on
screen<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.739> given<00:02:49.700> up<00:02:49.790> solutely<00:02:50.150> nothing<00:02:50.480> nice

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
screen as given up solutely nothing nice

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.009 
screen as given up solutely nothing nice
since<00:02:50.840> I've<00:02:50.959> been<00:02:51.109> trying<00:02:51.409> these<00:02:51.650> things<00:02:52.010> so

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
since I've been trying these things so

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.360 
since I've been trying these things so
I'm<00:02:54.019> going<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.230> open<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:54.590> up<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.159> have<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
I'm going to open it up just to have a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.729 
I'm going to open it up just to have a
lot<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.639> make<00:02:55.790> sure<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.750> connector<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.500> in

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
lot to make sure the connector is in

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.699 
lot to make sure the connector is in
place<00:02:58.599> for<00:02:59.599> the<00:03:00.079> LCD<00:03:01.069> make<00:03:01.939> sure<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.239> okay

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
place for the LCD make sure it's okay

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.289 
place for the LCD make sure it's okay
and<00:03:03.709> then<00:03:03.920> I'll<00:03:04.250> move<00:03:04.370> on<00:03:04.519> from<00:03:04.730> there<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.180> it

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
and then I'll move on from there but it

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.240 
and then I'll move on from there but it
is<00:03:05.389> locking<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.680> we're<00:03:06.859> going<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.010> have

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
is locking is that we're going to have

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.750 
is locking is that we're going to have
to<00:03:07.459> restore<00:03:07.819> this<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:09.560> maybe<00:03:10.250> any<00:03:10.459> chance

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
to restore this to have maybe any chance

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.750 
to restore this to have maybe any chance
of<00:03:11.109> one<00:03:12.109> gets<00:03:12.379> in<00:03:12.500> any<00:03:12.680> normal<00:03:12.829> operation<00:03:13.549> from

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
of one gets in any normal operation from

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.930 
of one gets in any normal operation from
it<00:03:13.939> well<00:03:14.420> then<00:03:14.540> too<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:15.290> anything<00:03:16.069> it's<00:03:16.790> going

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
it well then too if anything it's going

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.900 
it well then too if anything it's going
to<00:03:17.000> come<00:03:17.239> from<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.769> hard<00:03:18.949> way<00:03:19.129> okay<00:03:19.609> this<00:03:19.730> is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to come from the hard way okay this is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.729 
to come from the hard way okay this is
the<00:03:20.030> inside<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.569> iphone<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.230> LCD

the inside of the iphone the LCD
conectes<00:03:22.310> here<00:03:22.639> i'm<00:03:23.599> going<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.870> looking<00:03:24.079> at

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
conectes here i'm going to be looking at

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.759 
conectes here i'm going to be looking at
this<00:03:24.319> on<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:25.720> magnifying<00:03:26.720> glass<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.199> make<00:03:27.440> sure

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
this on a magnifying glass to make sure

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.099 
this on a magnifying glass to make sure
that<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:28.879> it's<00:03:29.090> okay<00:03:29.449> see<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:29.900> there's<00:03:30.019> any

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
that so it's okay see if there's any

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.530 
that so it's okay see if there's any
problems<00:03:30.590> whether<00:03:30.799> at<00:03:31.010> all<00:03:31.269> then<00:03:32.269> we'll<00:03:32.449> move

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
problems whether at all then we'll move

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.750 
problems whether at all then we'll move
on<00:03:32.720> from<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:32.980> okay<00:03:33.980> I've<00:03:34.069> already<00:03:34.220> looked<00:03:34.459> at

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
on from that okay I've already looked at

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.720 
on from that okay I've already looked at
this<00:03:35.359> connector<00:03:36.049> over<00:03:36.769> under<00:03:37.099> should<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.519> say<00:03:37.699> a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
this connector over under should I say a

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.629 
this connector over under should I say a
magnifying<00:03:38.540> glass<00:03:38.629> by<00:03:38.959> thought<00:03:39.199> I'd<00:03:39.319> show<00:03:39.560> it

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
magnifying glass by thought I'd show it

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.839 
magnifying glass by thought I'd show it
and<00:03:40.639> a<00:03:40.760> little<00:03:40.909> bit<00:03:41.180> bigger<00:03:42.310> sort<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.400> fun<00:03:43.579> on<00:03:43.819> a

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
and a little bit bigger sort of fun on a

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.569 
and a little bit bigger sort of fun on a
bigger<00:03:44.060> scale<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.829> main<00:03:46.129> board<00:03:46.370> out

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
bigger scale this is the main board out

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.210 
bigger scale this is the main board out
of<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.849> phone<00:03:47.090> now<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.169> is<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.530> connector

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
of the phone now this is the connector

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.460 
of the phone now this is the connector
that<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.729> USB<00:03:50.209> microscope<00:03:50.599> is<00:03:50.959> looking<00:03:51.319> at

that the USB microscope is looking at

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.539 
that the USB microscope is looking at
it's<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.549> LCD<00:03:53.030> connector<00:03:53.540> now<00:03:54.549> obviously

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
it's the LCD connector now obviously

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.670 
these pens on each side and that's
pretty<00:04:01.280> much<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.639> really<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:02.090> has<00:04:02.239> been

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
pretty much it really it has been

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.610 
pretty much it really it has been
replaced<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:04.129> can<00:04:04.280> tell<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:05.319> solder<00:04:06.319> doesn't

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
replaced you can tell the solder doesn't

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.960 
replaced you can tell the solder doesn't
look<00:04:06.799> as<00:04:07.099> smooth<00:04:07.639> as<00:04:08.290> what<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.409> is<00:04:09.560> when<00:04:10.459> the
