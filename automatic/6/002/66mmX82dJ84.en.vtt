00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
depth I could get in the Smith machine

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.600 
depth I could get in the Smith machine
for<00:03:37.730> stability<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.900> did<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:40.070> believe

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
functional strength athletes you could

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.300 
functional strength athletes you could
do<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:48.080> arm<00:03:48.290> rows<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.770> Smith<00:03:48.980> machine

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
do one arm rows in the Smith machine

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.160 
do one arm rows in the Smith machine
making<00:03:49.550> it<00:03:49.820> heavier<00:03:50.150> having<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.480> more<00:03:50.660> unstable

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
making it heavier having a more unstable

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.430 
making it heavier having a more unstable
uneven<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.040> also<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:52.880> longer<00:03:53.330> way<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.900> row<00:03:54.110> it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
uneven and also a longer way in a row it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.350 
uneven and also a longer way in a row it
also<00:03:54.890> allows<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.400> go<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> bit<00:03:55.760> heavier<00:03:56.150> if<00:03:56.239> your

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360
