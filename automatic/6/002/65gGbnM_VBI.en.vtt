00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 iPhone users have been denied the opportunity 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 participate in a straight line with 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.560
 Vladimir Putin Putin company not 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.330
 began to place a specially prepared 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.889
 an application that allows you to send 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 not only a question but also create 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 full video appeal and here's how 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 situation in an interview with Russia 24 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.820
 commented on the press secretary of the chapter 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.519
 states dmitry sands really 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.490
 the application can only find your brand 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.890
 head and although the developers were 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 prepared also the necessary 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 apple product application 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.649
 Unfortunately despite the fact that all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.899
 necessary treatment were temporarily 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.040
 made by the organizer and here's the project 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.550
 direct line not received so far 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.039
 response in this regard unfortunately 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.440
 product users cannot 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 mobile devices ask your 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.989
 questions within this program within 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.039
 straight line with it so easy 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.460
 compensated 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.920
 through the website that many do 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 are such a term 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 restrictive measures or something else 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.810
 neither can we slide because 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.770
 the answer itself is absent altogether 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 developers say that the reasons for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 which floor refused to place 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.170
 the application is flimsy none of them 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.790
 may serve convincing reasons for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.650
 which iPhone users have left 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.159
 without the ability to send everything to Vladimir 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 Putin video question initially 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.729
 we were supposed to do it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 application for the two most 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.000
 common kid android for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 android 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.040
 went very well two too problem 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.259
 was in the very beginning after 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 sending apps apple insisted on 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.689
 to be used worldwide 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.579
 numbers that is it was the first claim 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.409
 then, respectively, did not say that they 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.970
 can't log in with the american number and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.040
 so can not accommodate your 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 application that first purely formal 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.180
 occasion after we helped 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.189
 from the inputs of their mobile phone they 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 long been silent for 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.689
 a few days and suddenly the last 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.460
 time they have a sick answer the answer is that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.170
 they are not satisfied with the fact that we have a phone 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 at a certain turn specially 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.739
 blocks it is possible to press to conveniently 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.760
 it was writing to people in one format 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.680
 phone reimbursed horizon 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.019
 responsibly they gave up on this as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.209
 we see absolutely formal reasons for 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.430
 bounce unfortunately our company is very 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.900
 sorry 10 percent users 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.450
 mobile devices they are 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.930
 users got the opportunity task 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 video question 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.800
 so straight line with Vladimir Putin 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.080
 will be held on thursday just four or you 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.670
 47 minutes past the president answered 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160
 eighty five questions 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 it is expected that this year this record 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.230
 will be beaten 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.599
 call center ready to accept and process 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.790
 thousands of technical calls 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.650
 training we learn from the world of Catherine 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.150
 new katerina good day to you on 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.190
 hello vladimir if we talk about 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.989
 technical preparation for perhaps the most important 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.150
 technical innovation is that 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.430
 you can send a question to the president 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.080
 only using a telephone and 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 SMS messages as it was in the past 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.670
 years but also with the help of video appeal and you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.870
 Russian citizen can record video 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 can write special 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.480
 a video message for the president who is not 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.160
 must be longer than 40 seconds and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.630
 send over the internet here to 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.040
 the program as we were told 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.110
 the organizers use this service 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.690
 unprecedented popularity among citizens 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.069
 Russia why and why is this format 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.519
 decided to include in conversation with the president 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.819
 I suggest to listen right now to give 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.709
 opportunity for people 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.410
 ask questions the president is not easy 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.500
 the phone is not using with me 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.720
 not using the internet yet to show 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.180
 here are the very facts to visualize 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.580
 actually a problem in real 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.040
 the scale is placed strictly speaking 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.510
 service was extremely popular we did not 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.760
 waited really very active 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.040

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.330
 history straight line with the president 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.950
 provided by sign language truth not 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.030
 TV version is not that version 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.140
 which will be shown on the TV channel 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.730
 Russia 24 and Russia 1 and the Internet version 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.440

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.960
