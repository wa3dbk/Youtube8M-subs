car back is tight in we're actually

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.250 
car back is tight in we're actually
going<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.440> move<00:02:19.100> back<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:20.300> our<00:02:20.330> rabbit<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.170> we

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
going to move back to our rabbit that we

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.050 
going to move back to our rabbit that we
tied<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.950> back<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.459> hook<00:02:22.610> make<00:02:22.910> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
tied in to the back of the hook make it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.390 
tied in to the back of the hook make it
a<00:02:23.120> book<00:02:23.270> but<00:02:24.140> length<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> half<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> hook

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
a book but length and a half of the hook

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.510 
a book but length and a half of the hook
cut<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.180> there<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:28.010> now<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.250> we're<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.430> to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
cut it there so now what we're going to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.360 
cut it there so now what we're going to
do<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.990> form<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.140> dubbing<00:02:30.590> loop<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.070> I've<00:02:31.160> got<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
do is form a dubbing loop so I've got a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.449 
do is form a dubbing loop so I've got a
little<00:02:31.600> little<00:02:32.600> loop<00:02:32.950> tool<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.340> going

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
little little loop tool here I'm going

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.790 
little little loop tool here I'm going
to<00:02:34.550> grab<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.150> form<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.690> dubbing<00:02:36.020> loop<00:02:36.200> I'm

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
to grab it and form a dubbing loop I'm

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.260 
to grab it and form a dubbing loop I'm
going<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.040> loop<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.430> hearing<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.880> putting<00:02:38.150> my

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
going to loop in hearing of putting my

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.270 
going to loop in hearing of putting my
rabbit<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.870> form<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.620> dubbing<00:02:39.920> loop<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.190> you

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
rabbit and form a dubbing loop now you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.400 
rabbit and form a dubbing loop now you
want<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.550> keep<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.850> rabbit<00:02:41.270> long<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.290> when

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
want to keep this rabbit long so when

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.140 
want to keep this rabbit long so when
you<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:42.830> there<00:02:43.070> put<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
you put it in there put it in the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.210 
you put it in there put it in the
lengthwise<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.989> keep<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.830> as<00:02:45.920> long<00:02:46.070> as

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
lengthwise and keep it as long as

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.449 
lengthwise and keep it as long as
possible<00:02:47.050> now<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.739> dubbing<00:02:49.190> or

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.009 
possible now that I have the dubbing or
actually<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.030> rabbit<00:02:50.390> into<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> dubbing

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
actually the rabbit into the dubbing

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.800 
actually the rabbit into the dubbing
loop<00:02:51.170> I'm<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.340> tighten<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.700> up

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
loop I'm going to just tighten it up

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.710 
loop I'm going to just tighten it up
just<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.930> form<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.320> nice<00:02:55.209> dubbing<00:02:56.209> loop<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
just to form a nice dubbing loop and you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.600 
just to form a nice dubbing loop and you
want<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.140> hair<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.739> stick<00:02:57.980> out<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.400> want

want this hair is to stick out you want

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.330 
want this hair is to stick out you want
them<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.880> pull<00:02:59.090> out<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.800> keep<00:03:01.010> pulling

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
them to pull out and just keep pulling

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.150 
them to pull out and just keep pulling
it<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.549> east<00:03:01.730> raise<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:03.160> you
