whatever then you quickly need to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.290 
whatever then you quickly need to
communicate<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.220> first<00:02:50.460> 25<00:02:50.910> 30

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
communicate and for the first 25 30

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.840 
communicate and for the first 25 30
years<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:52.050> was<00:02:52.260> high<00:02:52.470> frequency<00:02:53.070> radios<00:02:53.550> which

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
years it was high frequency radios which

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.570 
years it was high frequency radios which
are<00:02:54.000> very<00:02:54.090> heavy<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:54.660> bulky<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.250> mobile

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
are very heavy very bulky so the mobile

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.570 
are very heavy very bulky so the mobile
telephone<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:58.020> huge<00:02:58.410> help<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.800> my<00:02:59.160> sort<00:02:59.489> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
susceptible to the sorts of problems

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.220 
susceptible to the sorts of problems
that<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.430> they<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.090> wet<00:03:06.330> they<00:03:07.080> get
