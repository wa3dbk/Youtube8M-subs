and and the back plate is that plate you
will<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.830> back<00:00:17.070> plate<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.080> there

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
will see that back plate is just there

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
will see that back plate is just there
is<00:00:19.109> no<00:00:19.320> way<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> unscrew<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> back<00:00:20.699> plate<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
is no way to unscrew the back plate the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.310 
is no way to unscrew the back plate the
back<00:00:21.930> plate<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:23.300> at<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.570> portion

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
back plate is actually at this portion

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
back plate is actually at this portion
of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> metal<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> coming<00:00:26.310> inside<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of the metal it is coming inside and is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
of the metal it is coming inside and is
being<00:00:27.570> folded<00:00:27.779> inside<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.859> hold<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> matter

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
being folded inside to hold the matter

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120 
being folded inside to hold the matter
of<00:00:29.429> plate<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.330> back<00:00:30.510> plate<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.830> what

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of plate the back plate right so what

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
of plate the back plate right so what
I'm<00:00:32.250> intending<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> color

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I'm intending to do is to make a color

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
I'm intending to do is to make a color
right<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.420> this

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
right here just like this one but this

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
right here just like this one but this
one<00:00:36.630> holds<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.680> cannot<00:00:37.980> use<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.370> one

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
one holds the more I cannot use this one

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.750 
one holds the more I cannot use this one
so<00:00:39.050> I'm<00:00:40.050> intending<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.250> ring<00:00:41.489> around

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so I'm intending to make a ring around

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.389 
so I'm intending to make a ring around
this<00:00:42.270> motor<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.290> ring<00:00:43.559> which<00:00:43.800> will<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this motor that ring which will have a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.900 
this motor that ring which will have a
color<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:47.280> somewhere

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
color right here here and some somewhere

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.500 
color right here here and some somewhere
over<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.559> color<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
over there and that color will have a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.619 
over there and that color will have a
screw<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.559> over<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.390> same

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
screw will come over here and the same

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
screw will come over here and the same
way<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> more<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> light<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.920> also<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
way the more of light will also have a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
way the more of light will also have a
color<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:58.800> I'm

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
color and that will be that's how I'm

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
color and that will be that's how I'm
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> screw<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.260> wouldn't<00:01:01.590> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
going to screw it on so I wouldn't be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.820 
going to screw it on so I wouldn't be
having<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.309> metal<00:01:02.879> hinge<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
having this metal hinge to this this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
having this metal hinge to this this
bent<00:01:05.129> metal<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> hold<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> motor<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.930> way

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
bent metal to hold the motor this way

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.410 
bent metal to hold the motor this way
it's<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:07.380> difficult<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.189> open<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> motor<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's very difficult to open the motor so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's very difficult to open the motor so
one<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> having<00:01:11.430> screw<00:01:11.850> it'll

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
one it has it will be having screw it'll

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
one it has it will be having screw it'll
be<00:01:12.360> easy<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> open<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> motor<00:01:13.380> again<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> then

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
be easy to open the motor again and then

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
be easy to open the motor again and then
fix<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.180> again<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
fix it back again I mean it's going to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.060 
fix it back again I mean it's going to
be<00:01:16.350> easy<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:18.140> what<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
be easy for me what I did was I did not

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.840 
be easy for me what I did was I did not
have<00:01:20.430> another<00:01:21.830> big<00:01:22.830> stripe<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> metal<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.790> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
have another big stripe of metal that I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270 
have another big stripe of metal that I
could<00:01:24.119> Bend<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.570> make<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> ring<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.100> would

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
could Bend and make a ring so it would

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
could Bend and make a ring so it would
it<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.759> easy<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.270> me<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> move<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.380> cut

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
it would be easy for me to move to cut

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.399 
it would be easy for me to move to cut
this<00:01:28.770> pipe<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.270> three<00:01:30.570> rings<00:01:30.990> grease

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this pipe into these three rings grease

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
this pipe into these three rings grease
set<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.979> rings<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> cut<00:01:34.409> them

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
set of rings and you see I have cut them

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
set of rings and you see I have cut them
in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.100> middle<00:01:35.250> portion<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> ring<00:01:36.210> right

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
in the middle portion of the ring right

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.160 
in the middle portion of the ring right
there

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
there

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
there
same<00:01:37.829> over<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.150> third<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
same over here and the third one it's

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
same over here and the third one it's
also<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
also like that right now I'm going to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
also like that right now I'm going to
just<00:01:42.329> straighten<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.049> out<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
just straighten it out a little bit to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.139 
just straighten it out a little bit to
just<00:01:45.030> fix<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.420> onto<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.930> motor<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.820> when<00:01:47.820> I'm

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
just fix it onto this motor and when I'm

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.810 
just fix it onto this motor and when I'm
in<00:01:48.509> short<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.140> I'll<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.680> weld<00:01:50.579> another

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
in short of it I'll just weld another

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
in short of it I'll just weld another
grain<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.750> still<00:01:52.409> am<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.890> short<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.579> I'm
