00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that we will stress is the wing play how

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
that we will stress is the wing play how
we're<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> wing<00:01:32.670> place

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
we're going to use the wing place

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
we're going to use the wing place
because<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.869> key<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.380> order<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> win

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
because that will be key in order to win

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
because that will be key in order to win
the<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.490> game<00:01:35.640> regardless<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.509> Japan

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the next game regardless if it's Japan

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.640 
the next game regardless if it's Japan
Sweden<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.740> whoever<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:38.970> they're<00:01:39.650> very

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
Sweden or whoever that is they're very

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
Sweden or whoever that is they're very
technical<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.689> under

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
technical but when we put them under

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.889 
technical but when we put them under
pressure<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.270> tend<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
pressure I think that they do tend to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.740 
pressure I think that they do tend to
give<00:01:46.409> away<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.770> ball<00:01:47.030> more<00:01:48.030> often<00:01:48.420> than<00:01:48.570> if

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
give away the ball more often than if

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.200 
give away the ball more often than if
they're<00:01:48.960> relaxed<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.970> working

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
they're relaxed and you know working

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.359 
they're relaxed and you know working
with<00:01:51.390> each<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.530> i<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.159> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
with each other so i think it's it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
with each other so i think it's it's
mostly<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.030> putting<00:01:54.479> pressure<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
mostly just putting pressure on them and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
mostly just putting pressure on them and
and<00:01:56.009> making<00:01:56.969> them<00:01:57.090> feel<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.719> they're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and making them feel like they're

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.740 
and making them feel like they're
unorganized<00:01:58.850> we<00:01:59.850> are<00:01:59.969> ready<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> play<00:02:00.570> our

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

unorganized we are ready to play our
game<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:02.460> look<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.360> taking<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.840> good

some good
reasons<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.170> then<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:13.100> have<00:02:13.190> sort

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
reasons for that and then we have sort

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.070 
reasons for that and then we have sort
that<00:02:13.640> out<00:02:13.700> let's<00:02:14.060> not<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.390> about<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:14.840> and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that out let's not that about that and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.880 
that out let's not that about that and
in<00:02:15.650> Japan<00:02:16.069> remember<00:02:16.730> play<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.620> hole

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
in Japan remember play in in this hole

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.490 
in Japan remember play in in this hole
it's<00:02:19.190> with<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.510> front<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.840> good<00:02:20.959> crowd<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's with in front of a good crowd I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.430 
it's with in front of a good crowd I
think<00:02:21.980> we<00:02:22.100> had<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> pretty<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.550> game<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.440> it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
think we had a pretty good game and it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.020 
think we had a pretty good game and it
will<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.740> interesting<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.100> see<00:02:25.250> how<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.730> goes

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
will be interesting to see how it goes

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.199 
will be interesting to see how it goes
this<00:02:26.480> game<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.670> will<00:02:28.820> look<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.060> little

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
this game because we will look a little

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.750 
this game because we will look a little
bit<00:02:29.390> different<00:02:29.750> compared<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:31.220> garb<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
bit different compared to all garb and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.060 
bit different compared to all garb and
Japan<00:02:32.300> every<00:02:33.020> time<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.290> step<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.709> pitch<00:02:33.860> we
