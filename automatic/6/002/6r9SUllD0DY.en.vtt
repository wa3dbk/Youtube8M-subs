00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.430
 hello to all these isophis 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.350
 14 in the company of zero x hi how 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.000
 are you okay 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.650
 perfectly fine for me too 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.029
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.189
 announce a brand new 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
 adventure an adventure that maybe you 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.170
 know and who will look like that yes 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.840
 the gorgeous that one there is not bad 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.579
 I do not have this one so it's all 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.390
 simply 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.170
 except elsewhere it's just a 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.100
 series created by a word theo which is very 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 nice you can see it 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 which adds a lot of fashion especially this 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.600
 transformation maurs mode which is 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.070
 pretty nice yes quite so yes 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.070
 we form a good baud family 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.659
 so well done that we can not 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.220
 pass the gates 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.270
 yeah yeah that's it that's pretty much not 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.369
 wrong so there is a lot a lot of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.289
 modes am here I think it's the most 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.509
 Funny considering that we can transform ourselves into 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.100
 everything and anything but we will be able to 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.990
 do lots of new stuff 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.130
 Well, here I am, I do not know too much 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.399
 still mostly me because I am 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.020
 arrived the most recently but we 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.459
 do not know too much we will make one to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.649
 two videos a week on this server 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:30.740
 so called magic hard kraft 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.470
 that you probably know because the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 live started with finally the live of 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.520
 Lacq 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.580
 ouais of black oxide amo and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 others started last week 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 So you probably know this 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.250
 we were not because we were in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.780
 live simply 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.269
 and suddenly we start because we've been 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 guest one is with blackhawks i am at 

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:54.240
 wolf and wool 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.000
 the one who made the launcher whose 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.500
 I always forget the name Madeira sq 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.820
 yes here I have trouble sorry all 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.729
 to forgive it's going to be 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.049
 we'll get used to it all of a sudden 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.429
 three times we start the video again 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.670
 so this time we go because the fair 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.080
 and yeah right so here's 36 mode 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.459
 the goal is going to be 2.2 turn around 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 magic just because it's 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.849
 one as its name says it's magic 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.630
 ision kraft so it revolves around the 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.880
 magic 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.500
 it will have to be done from kraft and 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.510
 new things accordingly and it's going 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.459
 to be rather nice I think so here 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.260
 quite entirely quite 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.720
 something to add my charger x 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.830
 award it blocks even well that yeah me 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.790
 I like to deny it because we are going 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.349
 faster is pretty funny it short 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.690

 personal information to give you 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.079
 that's why I blame without aloys 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.760
 since it does not concern those who are 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.560
 on the point of view of zero x 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.630

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.020
 maximum for this series there and I had 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.020

 new series so on one side it falls 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.910
 pretty good 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.930
