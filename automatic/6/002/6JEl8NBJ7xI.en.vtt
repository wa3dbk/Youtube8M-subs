00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we take great pride in the fact that we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
we take great pride in the fact that we
design<00:01:15.360> them<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> US<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.220> very

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
design them here in the US we use very

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
design them here in the US we use very
good<00:01:18.119> materials<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
good materials but they will have a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.130 
good materials but they will have a
fitness<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.060> purpose<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:21.780> that's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
fitness for purpose and I think that's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
fitness for purpose and I think that's
the<00:01:22.380> important<00:01:22.799> part<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the important part of what we do the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
the important part of what we do the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
other thing we noted about prepare is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219
