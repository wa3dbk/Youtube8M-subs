00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
what mass of NaCl is needed to make 500

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680 
what mass of NaCl is needed to make 500
milliliters<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.639> particular<00:00:08.940> volume<00:00:09.330> of

solution to convert from concentration
to<00:00:14.910> mass<00:00:16.010> first<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.310> need<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.490> find<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
to mass first you need to find the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
to mass first you need to find the
number<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> moles<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.859> number<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
number of moles because the number of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.519 
number of moles because the number of
moles<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.640> concentration<00:00:21.270> times<00:00:21.660> volume<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
moles is concentration times volume of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
moles is concentration times volume of
your<00:00:22.710> solution<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.600> convert<00:00:25.019> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
your solution and then convert that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.009 
your solution and then convert that
amount<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.740> moles<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.400> grams<00:00:26.810> because<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
amount in moles to grams because the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500 
amount in moles to grams because the
mass<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.189> number<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> moles<00:00:29.760> times<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
mass is the number of moles times the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.370 
mass is the number of moles times the
molar<00:00:30.810> mass<00:00:31.189> why<00:00:32.189> don't<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> together

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
molar mass why don't we do this together

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
molar mass why don't we do this together
find<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.620> number<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> moles<00:00:35.040> required<00:00:35.910> N

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
find the number of moles required N

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.000 
find the number of moles required N
equals<00:00:36.930> C<00:00:37.469> over<00:00:38.040> V<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.440> number<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.739> moles

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
equals C over V so the number of moles

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.130 
equals C over V so the number of moles
is<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.879> concentration<00:00:43.160> zero<00:00:44.160> point<00:00:44.730> two

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
is the concentration zero point two

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.319 
is the concentration zero point two
moles<00:00:46.140> per<00:00:46.620> liter<00:00:47.510> times<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.809> volume<00:00:49.289> needed

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
moles per liter times the volume needed

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.040 
moles per liter times the volume needed
0.5<00:00:51.500> liters<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.039> converted<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.329> liters<00:00:54.780> by

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
0.5 liters I converted this to liters by

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
0.5 liters I converted this to liters by
dividing<00:00:55.530> by<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> thousand<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.270> units

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
dividing by a thousand so that my units

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.600 
dividing by a thousand so that my units
matched<00:00:58.579> 0.2<00:00:59.579> times<00:01:00.359> 0.5<00:01:01.430> gives<00:01:02.600> point<00:01:03.600> one

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
matched 0.2 times 0.5 gives point one

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560 
matched 0.2 times 0.5 gives point one
moles<00:01:07.310> see<00:01:08.310> how<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.610> liters<00:01:08.970> cancel<00:01:09.240> each

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
moles see how my liters cancel each

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.560 
moles see how my liters cancel each
other<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.140> left<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.500> moles<00:01:11.150> now<00:01:12.150> all

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
other it I'm left with moles now all

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
other it I'm left with moles now all
that's<00:01:12.840> required<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> convert

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that's required is for me to convert

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.749 
that's required is for me to convert
from<00:01:14.610> moles<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.150> grams<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:16.310> can<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
from moles to grams I can do that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.499 
from moles to grams I can do that
because<00:01:18.830> mass<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.909> number<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> moles

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
because mass is the number of moles

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
because mass is the number of moles
times<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.470> molar<00:01:22.799> mass<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.930> already

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
times the molar mass I already

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.090 
times the molar mass I already
calculated<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.710> number<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> moles<00:01:26.450> 0.1<00:01:27.450> oh<00:01:28.100> now

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
calculated my number of moles 0.1 oh now

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.620 
calculated my number of moles 0.1 oh now
I<00:01:29.130> need<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> molar<00:01:29.939> mass<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.780> NaCl<00:01:32.630> according

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I need the molar mass of NaCl according

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.740 
I need the molar mass of NaCl according
to<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.750> periodic<00:01:34.170> table<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> molar<00:01:34.950> mass<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
to my periodic table the molar mass is

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
to my periodic table the molar mass is
twenty<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:36.930> point<00:01:37.320> nine<00:01:37.500> eight<00:01:37.530> nine<00:01:37.710> eight

twenty two point nine eight nine eight
Plus<00:01:41.869> 35.453<00:01:43.820> that's<00:01:44.820> 58<00:01:45.810> point<00:01:46.170> four<00:01:46.560> four

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.180 

when<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:55.200> multiply<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.950> two

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
when I actually multiply these two

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.530 
when I actually multiply these two
numbers<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:57.320> get<00:01:59.540> 5.8<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:01.430> my<00:02:02.430> moles<00:02:02.759> cancel<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
numbers I get 5.8 for my moles cancel it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.999 
numbers I get 5.8 for my moles cancel it
I'm<00:02:03.780> left<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.200> grams<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> takes<00:02:06.690> 5<00:02:07.470> point

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I'm left with grams so it takes 5 point

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.900 
I'm left with grams so it takes 5 point
