get<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> work<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.369> i<00:02:05.430> think<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.729> got<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
get this to work and i think i got to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.090 
get this to work and i think i got to
figure<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
figure it out and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.410 
figure it out and
this<00:02:08.340> has<00:02:08.700> been<00:02:08.780> relocated<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.960> top<00:02:10.320> here

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
this has been relocated up top here

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
this has been relocated up top here
close<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.600> hood<00:02:12.750> still<00:02:13.050> lots<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.470> clearance

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
close the hood still lots of clearance

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
close the hood still lots of clearance
and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.460> last<00:02:14.640> project<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.330> do<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.840> put

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and then one last project to do is put

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.990 
and then one last project to do is put
the<00:02:16.230> roof<00:02:16.470> rack<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.460> know<00:02:17.520> I'm<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the roof rack on and I know I'm going to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.160 
the roof rack on and I know I'm going to
run<00:02:18.090> into<00:02:18.270> troubles<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.260> because<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
run into troubles right here because the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
run into troubles right here because the
roof<00:02:22.740> racks<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> mount<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.730> side

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
roof racks going to mount on the side

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
roof racks going to mount on the side
here<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.450> i<00:02:24.510> already<00:02:24.600> got<00:02:24.810> these<00:02:25.080> plates<00:02:25.380> on

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
here and i already got these plates on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.560 
here and i already got these plates on
so<00:02:25.920> i<00:02:26.250> might<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.240> make<00:02:27.510> some

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
so i might have to make some

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.780 
so i might have to make some
modification<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.710> make<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.130> fit<00:02:29.490> i'm<00:02:29.640> not

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
modification to make it all fit i'm not

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
modification to make it all fit i'm not
exactly<00:02:30.150> sure<00:02:30.330> yet<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.840> we're<00:02:31.110> gonna<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
exactly sure yet but we're gonna have to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.200 
exactly sure yet but we're gonna have to
figure<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.790> got<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> air

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
figure that out and I got the air

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.180 
figure that out and I got the air
cleaner<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.200> cleaning<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:35.010> we

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
cleaner out and cleaning that as we

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610 
cleaner out and cleaning that as we
speak<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.330> basically<00:02:36.510> change<00:02:37.050> oil<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
speak and then basically change oil and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.610 
speak and then basically change oil and
 hopefully<00:02:39.750> we're<00:02:39.900> ready<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> go<00:02:40.380> then

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
 hopefully we're ready to go then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.710 
 hopefully we're ready to go then

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of one thing and in short you don't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.830 
of one thing and in short you don't
hardware<00:03:10.350> on<00:03:10.500> another<00:03:10.830> thing<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.850> mean<00:03:12.690> all

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
hardware on another thing so I mean all

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.860 
hardware on another thing so I mean all
in<00:03:13.020> all<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.730> think<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> money<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.660> you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
in all I think for the money that you

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.080 
in all I think for the money that you
spend<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.530> rack<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:17.040> could<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.280> put<00:03:18.060> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
spend on this rack they could just put a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.580 
spend on this rack they could just put a
little<00:03:18.150> bit<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.570> effort<00:03:18.750> into<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.440> give

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
little bit more effort into it and give

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.060 
little bit more effort into it and give
you<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.460> better<00:03:20.580> parts
