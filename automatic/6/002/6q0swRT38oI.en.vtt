that<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> problem<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.610> I'd

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that that's a problem with me so I'd

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.749 
that that's a problem with me so I'd
like<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> study<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
like to study that

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.580 
like to study that
why<00:01:17.240> can't<00:01:17.539> we<00:01:17.689> study<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.229> through<00:01:18.530> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
why can't we study that through a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.649 
why can't we study that through a
process<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.399> come<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.729> an<00:01:19.850> understanding<00:01:19.909> why

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
process and come to an understanding why

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.230 
process and come to an understanding why
than<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.380> native<00:01:21.799> schools<00:01:22.189> can<00:01:22.490> have<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.850> but

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
than the native schools can have it but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.660

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
so let's study it what are we rushing to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.240 
so let's study it what are we rushing to
judgment<00:01:37.069> for<00:01:37.729> here<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:39.200> think<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.679> we
