00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello, your lovely 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.319
 we continue to solve problems c5 of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 Yaschenko collection 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.590
 preparing for the exam in mathematics in 2013 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 year 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 Now we will solve c5 with 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 diagnostic work number 15 job 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 find all the parameter values â€‹â€‹as 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.830
 each of which has exactly three 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.670
 solving systems of equations 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 y + a is the modulus x plus 5 and the second 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.610
 equation x squared plus y minus 2 plus 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.020
 5 squared equals 4 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 let's pay attention that the second 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.329
 the equation we have is a circle 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.280
 I will remind the formula of a circle X minus X 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.370
 0 squared plus y minus y 0 squared 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.809
 equals r squared then we will have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
 some circle centered at x0 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.980
 y0 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.600
 and radius is useful to know this formula and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.750
 distinguish and for example such 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 tasks and the center along the x axis for a given 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.840
 equations we will have x 0 is zero but 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.470
 xx do not subtract anything, but along the y axis the center 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 will be at point 2 from -5 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 that's how ours will look like 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.170
 circle what this module looks like 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.869
 let's rewrite it like this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.150
 the form of y is equal to the module x plus 5 minus and then 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.619
 there is all this same module x 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.979
 just shifted by 5 minus a along the y axis 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.409
 for example here and here. tops 5 minus 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:59.369
 we ask and when will there be three 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.649
 solutions for this let's consider all 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.100
 possible positions of the module and 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.740
 circles if vertex modules and center 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.099
 the circles are on the same straight line 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.290
 we have such options 1 circle 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.989
 module touches and here's your top 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.420
 then we have one solution 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.390
 another option module went down a bit 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.400
 below and intersects the circle in two 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.140
 points 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.700
 another option module go down a little 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.569
 below and then touches its top 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.160
 circles as if from the inside and branches 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.650
 intersects the circle at two more points 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.780
 then we will have three solutions namely 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.890
 this option we will now 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.950
 seeks 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 well, the last just in case that you 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.959
 mean here such we have 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.959
 option when we have 4 solutions 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.230
 here they are not the last one actually is 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.459
 another option for completeness 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 pictures when the module touches the circle 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.799
 at two points well, and when it is understandable 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.500
 the case does not cross the circle 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.709
 we need to module its top 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.560
 touched the circle let's on the new 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:27.570
 pictures we denote what we need so 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.010
 circle centered at 2 a -5 y 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.820
 we were two 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.180
 and minus 5 module with the top at point 5 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.180
 minus a 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.220
 5 minus a and now we can catch 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.500
 here we know the connection of these two expressions 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.730
 that the distance between these points is equal 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.000
 radius of circle 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:59.870
 and the radius of the circle here is this 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.330
 formulas equal to two it turns out that 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.350
 greater point here it is above us lies 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.640
 subtract less than 2x minus 5 minus 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.560
 subtract here this point 5 minus a is equal to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.510
 two distances between these points 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:24.020
 equal to 2 we get 3 a minus 5 minus 5 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:27.590
 minus 10 equals 23 a equals 12 a equals 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.270
 four is all a solution to this number 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.210
 c5 the only possible difficulty was 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.790
 see here the circle and right 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.600
 position it relative to the module then 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.620
 there is to understand that they walk along the y axis of them 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.740
 vertex center 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 but actually this number is very 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:55.130
 simple and houses if you suddenly come across 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.160
 this number will be very good 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.960
 we can assume that really lucky 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.270
 subscribe to the next video soon 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.450
 there will be new analyzes of new tasks of all 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.450
 kind
