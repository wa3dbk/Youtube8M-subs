is pretty handicapped but for the most

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 
is pretty handicapped but for the most
part<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.310> he<00:01:41.939> would<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.090> good<00:01:42.360> from<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
part I think he would be good from the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800 
part I think he would be good from the
free-throw<00:01:43.380> line<00:01:44.360> actually<00:01:45.360> his<00:01:45.450> he<00:01:45.689> has<00:01:45.780> like

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
free-throw line actually his he has like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
free-throw line actually his he has like
backwards<00:01:46.170> elbows<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.920> might<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
backwards elbows so might not be that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.270 
backwards elbows so might not be that
good<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> return<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.100> almost

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
good so I go for a return and it almost

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.560 
good so I go for a return and it almost
killed<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.790> i<00:01:50.880> could<00:01:50.939> come<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.329> another

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
killed it i could come with another

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.060 
killed it i could come with another
return<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.140> decide<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.829> wild

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
return but i decide to go for a wild

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
return but i decide to go for a wild

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.030 
not completely simultaneous it's not
actually<00:05:40.660> simultaneous<00:05:41.470> at<00:05:41.620> all<00:05:41.800> because

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
actually simultaneous at all because

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.620 
actually simultaneous at all because
that<00:05:42.220> would<00:05:42.370> mean<00:05:42.700> that<00:05:42.760> they<00:05:43.090> happen<00:05:43.419> at<00:05:43.540> the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
that would mean that they happen at the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.469 
that would mean that they happen at the
same<00:05:43.660> time<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.410> they<00:05:45.010> didn't<00:05:45.550> unless<00:05:46.300> you

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
same time and they didn't unless you

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.580 
same time and they didn't unless you
have<00:05:46.510> a<00:05:46.630> time<00:05:46.690> machine<00:05:46.870> which<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.440> do<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:48.310> just

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
have a time machine which I do it just

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.159 
have a time machine which I do it just
is<00:05:50.590> in<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:51.010> shape<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.550> a

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
is in the shape of a

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.209 
is in the shape of a
a<00:05:52.759> one<00:05:53.759> of<00:05:53.879> those<00:05:53.999> like<00:05:54.240> we<00:05:54.569> wii<00:05:55.379> nunchuk

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
a one of those like we wii nunchuk

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.469 
a one of those like we wii nunchuk
things<00:05:56.659> that<00:05:57.659> is<00:05:58.460> not<00:05:59.460> powered<00:05:59.939> up<00:06:00.090> because

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
things that is not powered up because

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.110 
things that is not powered up because
it's<00:06:00.810> not<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:02.360> time-travelling<00:06:03.360> lee<00:06:03.539> mode

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
it's not in the time-travelling lee mode

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.120 
it's not in the time-travelling lee mode
yeah
