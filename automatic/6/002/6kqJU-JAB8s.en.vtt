now<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.750> question<00:01:56.140> we're<00:01:56.320> addressing<00:01:56.590> today

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
now the question we're addressing today

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.969 
now the question we're addressing today
is<00:01:57.100> how<00:01:57.280> do<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.460> stop<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.360> diarrhea<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.680> most

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
is how do I stop the diarrhea the most

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.420 
is how do I stop the diarrhea the most
important<00:02:00.520> thing<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:01.000> not<00:02:01.299> do<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.130> stop

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
important thing to not do is to stop

important thing to not do is to stop
giving<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.090> child<00:02:04.299> fluids<00:02:05.170> there<00:02:05.799> there<00:02:06.190> is

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
giving the child fluids there there is

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.100 
giving the child fluids there there is
an<00:02:06.400> old<00:02:06.580> wise<00:02:06.850> tale<00:02:07.210> out<00:02:07.420> there<00:02:07.659> well<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.990> need

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
an old wise tale out there well you need

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.779 
an old wise tale out there well you need
to<00:02:08.140> put<00:02:08.349> them<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.560> rest<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.039> stop<00:02:09.249> and<00:02:09.459> stuff<00:02:09.670> in

is good for this stuff if you're giving

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.690 
is good for this stuff if you're giving
a<00:02:27.010> formula<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.150> may<00:02:28.359> take<00:02:28.750> 8<00:02:29.500> hours<00:02:29.799> 12<00:02:30.459> hours
