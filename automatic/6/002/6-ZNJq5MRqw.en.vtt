in<00:00:57.850> will<00:00:58.569> secure<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.019> rack<00:00:59.199> into<00:00:59.379> place<00:01:04.379> now

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
in will secure the rack into place now

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.170 
in will secure the rack into place now
on<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.649> back<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.159> rack<00:01:06.369> there<00:01:06.909> are<00:01:07.000> little

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
on the back of the rack there are little

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.969 
on the back of the rack there are little
tension<00:01:07.479> knobs<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.170> little<00:01:08.380> tension<00:01:08.619> knobs

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
tension knobs the little tension knobs

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.969 
tension knobs the little tension knobs
turning<00:01:09.399> those<00:01:09.579> down<00:01:09.850> will<00:01:10.780> decrease<00:01:11.740> in<00:01:11.890> a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
turning those down will decrease in a

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.279 
turning those down will decrease in a
that<00:01:12.159> little<00:01:12.250> minor<00:01:12.700> movement<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.110> rack

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
that little minor movement in the rack

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.289 
that little minor movement in the rack
so<00:01:14.740> at<00:01:14.920> those<00:01:15.130> pivot<00:01:15.460> points<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.939> takes<00:01:16.119> out

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
so at those pivot points it takes out

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.999 
so at those pivot points it takes out
any<00:01:16.509> movement<00:01:16.539> kind<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.259> like<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> hand<00:01:17.799> tight

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
any movement kind of like the hand tight

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.270 
any movement kind of like the hand tight
cam<00:01:18.250> system<00:01:18.640> does<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:19.479> receiver<00:01:20.219> on<00:01:21.219> the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
cam system does in the receiver on the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.819 
cam system does in the receiver on the
top<00:01:21.579> of<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.789> rack<00:01:21.969> you<00:01:22.270> have<00:01:22.299> three<00:01:23.109> cradles

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
top of the rack you have three cradles

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.770 
top of the rack you have three cradles
or<00:01:24.070> three<00:01:24.280> trays<00:01:24.579> for<00:01:24.789> those<00:01:24.969> bikes<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.420> sit<00:01:25.630> in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
or three trays for those bikes to sit in

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.130 
or three trays for those bikes to sit in
now<00:01:26.590> these<00:01:26.740> pivot<00:01:27.159> so<00:01:28.030> depending<00:01:28.630> on<00:01:28.750> which

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
now these pivot so depending on which

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.109 
now these pivot so depending on which
way<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.350> lay<00:01:29.649> your<00:01:29.799> bikes<00:01:30.070> they<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:30.969> move

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
way you lay your bikes they can move

way you lay your bikes they can move
either<00:01:31.359> way<00:01:31.659> so<00:01:32.289> bikes<00:01:32.530> are<00:01:32.710> laid<00:01:32.890> out<00:01:32.920> on<00:01:33.369> here

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
either way so bikes are laid out on here

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.469 
either way so bikes are laid out on here

does come with a locking hitch pin for
the<00:02:05.499> receiver<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.909> also<00:02:07.149> comes<00:02:07.509> with<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.719> cable

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
the receiver it also comes with a cable

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.350 
the receiver it also comes with a cable
lock<00:02:08.290> for<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.650> outside<00:02:09.040> what<00:02:09.550> this<00:02:09.729> does<00:02:10.000> is

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
lock for the outside what this does is

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.180 
lock for the outside what this does is
as<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.750> remove<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.200> cable<00:02:11.650> or<00:02:11.770> pull<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.040> out

as you remove this cable or pull it out

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.980 
as you remove this cable or pull it out
it<00:02:12.550> allows<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.150> secure<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.660> out

it allows you to secure that out

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.380 
it allows you to secure that out
I'd<00:02:14.140> bike<00:02:14.350> wraps<00:02:14.980> around<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.490> frame<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.000> back

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
I'd bike wraps around the frame and back

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.420 
I'd bike wraps around the frame and back
into<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> rack<00:02:17.050> now<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.010> keyed<00:02:18.250> by

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
into the rack now this is keyed by

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.460 
into the rack now this is keyed by
itself<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> key<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.290> want

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
itself so it's not a key that you want

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.520 
itself so it's not a key that you want
to<00:02:20.530> lose<00:02:21.270> stowing<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.360> back<00:02:22.510> away<00:02:22.690> it'll<00:02:23.290> slide

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to lose stowing it back away it'll slide

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.070 
to lose stowing it back away it'll slide
back<00:02:23.740> into<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.190> rack<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.240> hold<00:02:25.600> into<00:02:25.870> place

back into the rack and hold into place

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.390 
back into the rack and hold into place
so<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.410> not<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.800> end<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:26.980> bouncing

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
