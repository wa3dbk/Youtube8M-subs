 quite difficult at the very beginning 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.320
 you go through the azure coast and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.330
 go straight up through the Pyrenees and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.950
 leader who can win the tour de france 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.250

 team that will be present mostly from 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.950

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.390

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.490
 thibaut pinot and young do not come anymore 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.240
 great French hopes get the towers and 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.480
 other races 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.040
 he is 23 years old he won a stage the year 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.490
 last is the turn of France for his 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 participation and finishes 10th of the round of 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.780
 france or place arnold jeannesson 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.420
 now 14th of the Tour de France 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.980
 n2 in a very promising corridor yet 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.000
 once who will accompany thibaut 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.040
 pinot in the mountains 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.950
 whether in the actual rate or in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 my turn on lawsuits that swim in 2013 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.690
 I'm counting on him if I can do it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.610
 attack in the mountain stages 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.260
 for the climber's jersey why not 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.319
 but it will be especially there to be 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.610
 collective around and maybe even 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.250
 play his personal card 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.260
 it was great climber here is arthur 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.060
 vichot new champion of France since 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.880
 few days he succeeds his 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.080
 teammate nacer bouhanni in the game he 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.310
 will not have the same champion of France 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.050
 because the update was not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.160
 done before but it's 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.290
 new champion of France on road 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.390
 she very very good runner 24 years old 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.349
 very young what crisis to become one 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.880
 of the biggest currents of his 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.440
 generation in the coming years 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.970
 I'm counting on him to try to 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.660
 take the polka dot jersey at the very beginning 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.099
 steps of the month yet that's why 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.780
 not do some nice breakaways 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.810
 during the tour de france pierrick 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.540
 federigo the big brother of the team the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.819
 older former champion of France well 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.270
 his multiple stage winners on the 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.130
 candid choice that had 88 4 or 5 very very 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.410
 good runners a great puncher who you 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 serve as an adventurer I try to expose 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.460
 the race at times with him for 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.500
 dynamite the mans the race and try 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.330
 leaders to escape and can not 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.620
 win a stage with him a very good 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.280
 runner getting back in shape 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.500
 see it's a little the team boss 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.030
 with his age alexander geniez s is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.300
 still a young person with training 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.729
 French games even very promising 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.000
 again that intervenes too 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.490
 well done 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.350
 atmosphere and I rely on him for less 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.420
 to blast the race and why not 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.390
 go for a stage win in 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.980
 this tour de france and do its best 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.350
 because he may have a little trouble 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.690
 mountains but here may be 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.280
 road captain of the clan and 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.500
 maximums to seek victories 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.470
 stage the place to jérémy the rights to 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.880
 a great honor of the few fdj 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.890
 times vice-champion of France behind 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.560
 them chavanel on the time trial 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.550
 good rider of the team then I count 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.500
 on him for the time trial by 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.669
 teams too even though I know I 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.000
 misses the leg pain fine by 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.160
 teams 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.740
 I think we'll finish the year or before 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.780
 last when I sold my momentum 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.890
 against nice 1-0 but hey that's a 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.020
 big wheeler I'm counting on him too 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.040
 for multimedia race and that risk 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.460
 to hurt with him 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.140
 murilo fischer brazil that is to say 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.620
 it's not too big brother too 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.660
 team 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.120
 a new recruit for the fdj in 2013 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.310
 he 's 33 years old if I remember well that's 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.280
 a little the grandpa of the team had preferred 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.080
 go then he is rather a sprinter 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
 or a pilot fish that can bring the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.310
 sprinter then a quack to manas peter 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.250
 is called the pilot fish and I think 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.050
 he too like as william hat 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.580
 run after to take nacer bouhanni 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.220
 in sprints 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.160
 william bonnet the grandpa of the team too 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.169
 it's getting old now and but we 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.600
 always count on him it's a runner 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.400
 experienced who will also serve as 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.780
 pilot fish a lectured our 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.390
 sprinter on this tour de france 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.700
 an experienced pilot fish and well 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.890
 placed his runner before the final sprint 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.810
 this is the role of a pilot fish is 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.330
 to properly position his sprinter 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.740
 currency in his wheel the at most the most 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.810
 possible up the platoon for it to be 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.890
 moved on arrival and to precede 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.140
 sprint stage 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.450
