00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the block goes out here transmits power

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.100 
the block goes out here transmits power
from<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.140> torch<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.790> business<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
from the torch in this business the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.259 
from the torch in this business the
first<00:02:14.290> way<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:18.069> all<00:02:18.190> have<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.489> do<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.670> same

first way and we all have to do the same

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.170 
first way and we all have to do the same
thing<00:02:19.629> right<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.849> so<00:02:27.849> let's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
thing right here just like that so let's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:37.800 
thing right here just like that so let's
just<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:36.660> okay

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
just see okay

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.110 
just see okay
we'll<00:02:38.319> fill<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.160> with<00:02:39.220> whoo<00:02:39.610> later<00:02:42.120> when

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
we'll fill this up with whoo later when

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.020 
we'll fill this up with whoo later when
you're<00:02:43.269> done<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:44.739> comes<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> trick

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you're done with that it comes the trick

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.020 
you're done with that it comes the trick
part<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.700> believe<00:02:48.700> before<00:02:49.410> present<00:02:50.410> torch

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
part so I believe before present torch

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.020 
part so I believe before present torch
wisdom<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.930> time<00:02:53.849> it's<00:02:54.849> different

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
wisdom but this time it's different

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.880 
wisdom but this time it's different
because<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.870> needs<00:02:56.380> power

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
because this needs power

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.720 
because this needs power
this<00:02:57.640> isn't<00:02:58.120> chip<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.769> pushes<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> back

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
this isn't chip that pushes out the back

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:13.220 
this isn't chip that pushes out the back
here<00:03:01.000> so<00:03:03.000> please<00:03:04.000> let<00:03:04.239> us<00:03:04.269> know<00:03:04.480> like<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.229 

okay<00:03:14.549> then<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:16.060> repeater<00:03:16.450> with<00:03:16.810> four<00:03:17.109> ticks

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
okay then the repeater with four ticks

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.629 
okay then the repeater with four ticks
maximum<00:03:19.239> play<00:03:20.519> done<00:03:22.109> so<00:03:23.109> when<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:24.010> block<00:03:24.430> comes

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
maximum play done so when a block comes

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.440 
maximum play done so when a block comes
here<00:03:26.280> see

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
here see
