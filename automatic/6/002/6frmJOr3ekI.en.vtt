sorrowful<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:37.110> around<00:01:37.409> 32

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
sorrowful as you see have around 32

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
sorrowful as you see have around 32
starting<00:01:38.340> ammo<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:39.600> nothing<00:01:40.259> really

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
starting ammo so that's nothing really

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
starting ammo so that's nothing really
to<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:41.939> thing

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to look at it it's just a little thing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.039 
to look at it it's just a little thing
you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.689> definitely<00:01:42.840> not

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you can get but it's definitely not

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.330 
you can get but it's definitely not
below<00:01:43.290> average<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
below average so it's not really a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
below average so it's not really a
disadvantage<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> weapon<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
disadvantage to the weapon now the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
disadvantage to the weapon now the
starting<00:01:46.560> ammunition<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.369> vary

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
starting ammunition this will vary

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.539 
starting ammunition this will vary
between<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.329> scavenger<00:01:48.840> pro<00:01:49.189> or<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
between if you have scavenger pro or it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
between if you have scavenger pro or it
can<00:01:50.670> bear<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.390> extended<00:01:51.810> mags<00:01:51.990> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can bear it if you have extended mags if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
can bear it if you have extended mags if
you<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.290> both<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.549> pretty

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you have both of them then you're pretty

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
you have both of them then you're pretty
much<00:01:53.850> top<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> ball<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.750> gun<00:01:54.960> but

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
much top of the ball with this gun but

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
much top of the ball with this gun but
it<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.829> will<00:01:55.890> disadvantage<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it will it will disadvantage you in

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.389 
it will it will disadvantage you in
other<00:01:56.969> stuff<00:01:57.240> later<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> weapon<00:01:58.649> stats<00:01:58.950> so

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
other stuff later in the weapon stats so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.399 
other stuff later in the weapon stats so
starting<00:02:00.090> ammunition<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> 32<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.290> you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
starting ammunition will be 32 if you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.990 
starting ammunition will be 32 if you
just<00:02:01.619> use<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> gun<00:02:02.070> plain<00:02:02.369> start<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.790> no

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
just use the gun plain start with no

extended catchments wither ammunition

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.760 
extended catchments wither ammunition
supplies<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> 32<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.649> that's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
supplies but it will be 32 and that's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.650 
supplies but it will be 32 and that's
still<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.069> much<00:02:08.340> average<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
still pretty much average but when the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.999 
still pretty much average but when the
extended<00:02:09.989> mags<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> could<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.440> 48<00:02:10.860> with

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
extended mags it could be 48 with

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.580 
extended mags it could be 48 with
scavenger<00:02:11.400> pro<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.090> 96<00:02:12.780> rounds

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
scavenger pro it will be 96 rounds

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
scavenger pro it will be 96 rounds
so<00:02:13.849> depending<00:02:14.849> on<00:02:15.030> how<00:02:15.330> ever<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.959> gun

you can get up to ninety six rounds
that's<00:02:18.269> just<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:18.780> scavenger<00:02:19.110> pro<00:02:19.230> at

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that's just with scavenger pro at

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.380 
that's just with scavenger pro at
cinemax<00:02:19.769> though<00:02:19.950> which<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.220> great<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:20.940> if

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
cinemax though which is great because if

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210

there's<00:02:50.099> almost<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.640> more<00:02:51.299> almost<00:02:51.750> above

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
there's almost a more almost above

there's almost a more almost above
average<00:02:52.140> guys<00:02:52.579> just<00:02:53.579> because<00:02:53.849> with<00:02:54.269> like

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
average guys just because with like

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.300 
average guys just because with like
sleight<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.349> hand<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.680> stuff<00:02:55.920> or<00:02:56.099> quick

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.130 
thinking then it would probably make it
two<00:02:58.980> seconds<00:02:59.489> just<00:03:00.060> depending<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.540> however<00:03:01.019> it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
two seconds just depending on however it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.750 
two seconds just depending on however it
works<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:01.530> reload<00:03:01.829> time<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.489> could<00:03:02.640> be<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
works but reload time that could be a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.369 
works but reload time that could be a
little<00:03:03.030> bit<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:04.019> bit<00:03:04.110> shorter

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
little bit like a little bit shorter

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.110 
little bit like a little bit shorter
depending<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.190> extra<00:03:05.579> perks<00:03:05.910> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
depending if you have extra perks that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.819 
depending if you have extra perks that
can<00:03:06.209> help<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.420> reload<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
can help you reload but if you have the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.440 
can help you reload but if you have the
usual<00:03:08.010> gun<00:03:08.310> three<00:03:08.640> seconds<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.090> definitely

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
usual gun three seconds it's definitely

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.900 
usual gun three seconds it's definitely
amazing<00:03:09.599> because<00:03:10.730> considering<00:03:11.730> there's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
amazing because considering there's

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.100 
amazing because considering there's
other<00:03:12.030> guns<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.390> take<00:03:12.599> forward<00:03:12.810> five

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
other guns that take forward five

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.600 
other guns that take forward five
seconds<00:03:13.530> three<00:03:13.709> seconds<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.190> definitely

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
seconds three seconds is definitely

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.539 
seconds three seconds is definitely
either<00:03:14.879> average<00:03:15.209> or<00:03:15.420> above-average<00:03:16.549> so

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
either average or above-average so

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.309 
either average or above-average so
moving<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.910> from<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> three<00:03:18.450> second<00:03:18.780> time<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
moving up from the three second time the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.250 
moving up from the three second time the
recoil<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:20.040> incredibly<00:03:20.579> low<00:03:20.850> now<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.389> this

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
recoil is incredibly low now I know this

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.410 
recoil is incredibly low now I know this
gun<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.920> more<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.609> move<00:03:24.090> around<00:03:24.299> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
gun is more of like a move around the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.479 
gun is more of like a move around the
map<00:03:24.480> rush<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.200> them<00:03:25.350> shoo<00:03:25.680> em<00:03:25.859> take<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.370> out

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
map rush to them shoo em take them out

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.190 
map rush to them shoo em take them out
it's<00:03:26.790> more<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.420> weapon<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:28.019> really

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it's more of that weapon it's not really

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.720 
it's more of that weapon it's not really
a<00:03:28.230> long-range<00:03:28.530> weapon<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.069> this<00:03:29.280> will<00:03:29.459> still

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
a long-range weapon but this will still

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.180 
a long-range weapon but this will still
work<00:03:29.910> long<00:03:30.180> range<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.139> a<00:03:31.799> certain

bullets so um having a for buff shot
would

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
possible so the four best shot is like I

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.610 
possible so the four best shot is like I
said<00:04:59.610> as<00:04:59.730> a<00:04:59.760> bit<00:04:59.970> like<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.210> m16<00:05:00.690> sorry<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.470> have

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
said as a bit like the m16 sorry I have

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.250 
said as a bit like the m16 sorry I have
a<00:05:01.650> skype<00:05:01.980> call<00:05:02.130> coming<00:05:02.430> up<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:03.080> there<00:05:04.080> we<00:05:04.140> go

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
a skype call coming up and there we go

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.930 
a skype call coming up and there we go
so<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.740> four<00:05:04.950> best<00:05:05.100> shot<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.610> bit<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:05.880> a

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
now moving away from the fire mode which

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.250 
now moving away from the fire mode which
I<00:05:20.550> thought<00:05:20.760> was<00:05:20.880> amazing<00:05:21.450> we're<00:05:21.840> now<00:05:22.050> coming

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
I thought was amazing we're now coming

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.490 
I thought was amazing we're now coming
into<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.590> fire<00:05:22.860> rate<00:05:23.340> now<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:23.910> fiery<00:05:24.240> is<00:05:24.630> 750

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
into the fire rate now the fiery is 750

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.280 
into the fire rate now the fiery is 750
rounds<00:05:25.530> per<00:05:26.100> minute<00:05:26.310> which<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:27.080> above<00:05:28.080> average

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
rounds per minute which is above average

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.200 
rounds per minute which is above average
from<00:05:28.710> what<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:28.860> would<00:05:29.070> say<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.520> other<00:05:29.730> guns<00:05:29.970> will

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
from what I would say as other guns will

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.930 
from what I would say as other guns will
probably<00:05:30.690> do<00:05:30.810> about<00:05:30.990> 600<00:05:31.620> 700<00:05:32.220> rounds<00:05:32.850> per

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
probably do about 600 700 rounds per

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.250 
probably do about 600 700 rounds per
minute<00:05:33.030> depending<00:05:33.210> on<00:05:33.420> what<00:05:33.540> gun<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.720> have<00:05:33.840> of

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
minute depending on what gun you have of

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.110 
minute depending on what gun you have of
course<00:05:34.770> if<00:05:34.920> you<00:05:35.040> do<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.400> light<00:05:35.610> machine<00:05:35.910> gun

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
course if you do in a light machine gun

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.970 
course if you do in a light machine gun
then<00:05:36.570> you'll<00:05:36.960> probably<00:05:37.140> get<00:05:37.320> more<00:05:37.560> rounds<00:05:37.860> per

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
then you'll probably get more rounds per

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.470 
then you'll probably get more rounds per
minute<00:05:38.100> it<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.490> depends<00:05:38.790> on<00:05:38.880> how<00:05:39.030> many<00:05:39.240> perks

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480
