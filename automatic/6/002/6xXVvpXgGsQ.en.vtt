back<00:04:07.940> later<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.870> important<00:04:09.410> it's

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
back later to be important it's

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.650 
back later to be important it's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.440 
definitely think oh that's going to be
important<00:04:12.200> gets<00:04:12.560> forgotten<00:04:12.950> about<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:14.180> long

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
important gets forgotten about just long

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.880 
important gets forgotten about just long
enough<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.110> when<00:04:15.350> it's<00:04:15.500> brought<00:04:15.710> up

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
enough so that when it's brought up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.699 
enough so that when it's brought up
again<00:04:16.040> you're<00:04:16.370> like<00:04:16.519> oh<00:04:16.700> yeah<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.260> i<00:04:18.380> really

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
like stuff like that and because i

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.380 
like stuff like that and because i
expected<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.500> be<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.799> pointless<00:04:22.280> anime<00:04:22.910> but<00:04:23.210> was

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
expected to be a pointless anime but was

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.630 
expected to be a pointless anime but was
fun<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.870> look<00:04:24.050> at<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.590> didn't<00:04:24.920> expect<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.580> to

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
fun to look at I didn't expect it to

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.850 
fun to look at I didn't expect it to
have<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> plot<00:04:26.540> with<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.900> little<00:04:27.170> bit<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.500> dark

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
have a plot with a little bit of a dark

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.040 
have a plot with a little bit of a dark
side<00:04:28.160> under<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.580> surface<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.630> made<00:04:29.930> me

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
side under the surface so that made me

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.950 
side under the surface so that made me
happy<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.670> wonder<00:04:31.670> what<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.180> about<00:04:32.450> darkness

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
happy I wonder what it is about darkness

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.650 
happy I wonder what it is about darkness
that's<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:33.560> exciting<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.430> did<00:04:35.150> enjoy<00:04:35.450> this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
that's so exciting I did enjoy this

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.010 
that's so exciting I did enjoy this
anime<00:04:36.080> even<00:04:36.950> if<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.250> had<00:04:37.520> been<00:04:37.550> just<00:04:38.270> for<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
anime even if it had been just for the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.320 
anime even if it had been just for the
pretty<00:04:39.290> boys<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:40.010> still<00:04:40.820> would<00:04:41.060> have<00:04:41.090> enjoyed

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
pretty boys I still would have enjoyed

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.270 
pretty boys I still would have enjoyed
it<00:04:41.630> because<00:04:41.900> it's<00:04:42.230> what<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.500> was<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.040> mood

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
it because it's what I was in the mood

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.550

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.860 
for when I went looking for a new anime

a<00:06:14.800> long<00:06:15.249> time<00:06:15.819> ago<00:06:16.029> so<00:06:16.719> my<00:06:17.319> artistic<00:06:17.649> abilities

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
a long time ago so my artistic abilities

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.369 
a long time ago so my artistic abilities
even<00:06:18.279> worse<00:06:18.819> than<00:06:19.209> and<00:06:19.539> it<00:06:19.629> is<00:06:19.779> now<00:06:20.020> which<00:06:20.349> is

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
even worse than and it is now which is

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.519 
even worse than and it is now which is
saying<00:06:20.770> something<00:06:21.360> but<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.719> just<00:06:22.990> drew<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.259> lot

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
saying something but I just drew a lot

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.339 
saying something but I just drew a lot
of<00:06:23.649> different<00:06:24.490> styles<00:06:24.879> and<00:06:25.389> I<00:06:25.599> think<00:06:25.870> only<00:06:26.050> one

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
of different styles and I think only one

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.049 
of different styles and I think only one
of<00:06:26.469> them<00:06:26.529> is<00:06:26.680> my<00:06:26.800> own<00:06:27.009> style<00:06:27.370> i<00:06:27.669> just<00:06:27.849> kept

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:28.059

borrowing<00:06:28.360> from<00:06:28.749> other<00:06:28.930> people<00:06:29.409> styles<00:06:29.769> just

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
borrowing from other people styles just

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.219 
borrowing from other people styles just
to<00:06:30.249> see<00:06:30.490> what<00:06:30.639> it<00:06:30.729> would<00:06:30.819> look<00:06:31.029> like<00:06:31.089> so<00:06:32.080> what
