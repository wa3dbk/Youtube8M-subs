00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.269 

I<00:00:04.779> met<00:00:05.779> the<00:00:05.930> Bridgeport<00:00:06.140> I'm<00:00:06.769> gonna<00:00:06.979> drill

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
I met the Bridgeport I'm gonna drill

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.339 
I met the Bridgeport I'm gonna drill
four<00:00:07.639> holes<00:00:07.670> in<00:00:08.360> a<00:00:08.480> roll<00:00:08.690> and<00:00:09.219> then<00:00:10.219> ream<00:00:10.580> them

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
four holes in a roll and then ream them

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.739 
four holes in a roll and then ream them
3/8<00:00:12.349> so<00:00:13.099> that<00:00:13.280> I<00:00:13.309> can<00:00:13.459> use<00:00:13.580> 3/8<00:00:14.089> dowel<00:00:14.360> pins

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:14.749 
3/8 so that I can use 3/8 dowel pins

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.040 
3/8 so that I can use 3/8 dowel pins
that's<00:00:15.709> this<00:00:16.039> size<00:00:16.340> here<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.750> I'm<00:00:17.840> going<00:00:17.990> to

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
that's this size here and I'm going to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.939 
that's this size here and I'm going to
put<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.440> holes<00:00:19.750> 5/8<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.929> an<00:00:21.050> inch<00:00:21.140> apart<00:00:21.349> that

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
put the holes 5/8 of an inch apart that

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.240 
put the holes 5/8 of an inch apart that
way<00:00:22.810> when<00:00:23.810> I<00:00:23.840> take<00:00:24.679> 5/8<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:26.349> two<00:00:27.349> radiuses<00:00:27.830> of

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
way when I take 5/8 and two radiuses of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.429 
way when I take 5/8 and two radiuses of
the<00:00:28.640> 3/8<00:00:29.089> you<00:00:29.269> know<00:00:29.359> it'll<00:00:29.599> equal<00:00:29.900> one<00:00:30.140> ends

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
the 3/8 you know it'll equal one ends

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.850 
the 3/8 you know it'll equal one ends
for<00:00:30.650> an<00:00:31.099> easy<00:00:31.310> inspection<00:00:32.090> size<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:32.870> I've<00:00:33.560> got

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
for an easy inspection size so I've got

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.160 
for an easy inspection size so I've got
a<00:00:33.890> bigger<00:00:34.670> center<00:00:35.450> drill<00:00:35.629> in<00:00:35.780> there<00:00:35.960> when<00:00:36.140> I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
a bigger center drill in there when I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.750 
a bigger center drill in there when I
did<00:00:36.410> last<00:00:36.680> time<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:36.980> think<00:00:37.160> that's<00:00:37.399> going<00:00:37.700> to

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
did last time I think that's going to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.689 
did last time I think that's going to
make<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:39.739> might<00:00:40.039> have<00:00:40.190> been<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.430> entire

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
make that might have been the entire

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.729 
make that might have been the entire
problem<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:41.449> that's<00:00:41.600> that's<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:42.530> going

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
problem because that's that's not going

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.340 
problem because that's that's not going
to<00:00:42.860> bend<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:43.309> not<00:00:43.460> going<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.789> deflect<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.600> I'm

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
to bend it's not going to deflect so I'm

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.479 
to bend it's not going to deflect so I'm
going<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.649> center<00:00:46.250> drill<00:00:46.489> four<00:00:47.090> holes<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:48.489> I'm

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
going to center drill four holes and I'm

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:59.750 
going to center drill four holes and I'm
not<00:00:49.699> going<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> show<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.359> whole<00:00:50.539> thing

Center drilled now I'm going to drill
2364<00:01:57.870> which<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.700> one<00:01:59.700> size<00:01:59.970> under<00:02:00.450> 3/8<00:02:01.580> I'm

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.520 
2364 which is one size under 3/8 I'm
using<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.000> stubby<00:02:03.420> bit<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:04.020> those<00:02:04.260> stubby

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
using a stubby bit I like those stubby

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.160 
using a stubby bit I like those stubby
bits<00:02:04.830> they<00:02:04.980> don't<00:02:05.190> reflect

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
you might say whether to do one whole

you might say whether to do one whole
from<00:03:23.720> start<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.200> finish<00:03:24.230> and

just two minutes oil changes so I think

three-eighths<00:03:39.139> dolls<00:03:39.469> I<00:03:39.889> only<00:03:40.040> had<00:03:40.249> three

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
three-eighths dolls I only had three

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.369 
three-eighths dolls I only had three
short<00:03:40.819> ones<00:03:41.060> then<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.359> head<00:03:41.510> along<00:03:41.749> with<00:03:42.019> us<00:03:42.170> why

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
short ones then I head along with us why

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.879 
short ones then I head along with us why
there's<00:03:43.340> different<00:03:43.670> sizes<00:03:43.909> in<00:03:44.299> there<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.349> I'm

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
there's different sizes in there and I'm

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.860 
there's different sizes in there and I'm
reasonably<00:03:46.400> happy<00:03:46.489> with<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.120> results<00:03:47.659> here's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
reasonably happy with the results here's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.839 
reasonably happy with the results here's
the<00:03:48.400> reading<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.609> the<00:03:49.879> I<00:03:51.159> barely<00:03:52.159> have<00:03:52.400> room<00:03:52.430> in

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
the reading on the I barely have room in

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.830 
the reading on the I barely have room in
there<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.299> jaws<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.450> one<00:03:59.629> was

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
there for the jaws so that one was

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.699 
there for the jaws so that one was
within<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.500> half<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.919> thousand<00:04:05.469> that<00:04:06.469> one's

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
within a half a thousand that one's

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.589 
within a half a thousand that one's
within<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.159> half<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.519> thousand<00:04:07.969> the<00:04:08.120> other<00:04:08.269> way

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.330 

and<00:04:11.599> we're<00:04:12.049> within<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.439> half<00:04:12.650> thousand<00:04:13.159> there

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and we're within a half thousand there

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.629 
and we're within a half thousand there
so<00:04:13.579> we're<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.359> good<00:04:15.370> compared<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.489> last

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
so we're really good compared to last

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.279 
so we're really good compared to last
time<00:04:19.120> it'll<00:04:20.120> discrepancy<00:04:20.810> there<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.169> we'll

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
time it'll discrepancy there and we'll

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.100 
time it'll discrepancy there and we'll
depends<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.310> how<00:04:22.400> hard<00:04:22.699> I<00:04:22.940> push<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
depends on how hard I push on the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.469 
depends on how hard I push on the
calipers<00:04:24.590> too<00:04:24.940> now<00:04:25.940> I'm<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.300> knock

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
calipers too now I'm going to knock

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.439 
calipers too now I'm going to knock
those<00:04:26.720> out<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:27.020> there<00:04:27.259> and<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.820> leave<00:04:28.970> two<00:04:29.240> in

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
those out of there and just leave two in

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.790 
those out of there and just leave two in
there<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.139> then<00:04:30.229> I'll<00:04:30.320> check<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.680> with<00:04:30.770> a

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
there and then I'll check it with a

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.150 
there and then I'll check it with a
conventional<00:04:31.370> micrometer<00:04:32.740> okay<00:04:33.740> I'm<00:04:33.830> down<00:04:33.979> to

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
conventional micrometer okay I'm down to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.659 
conventional micrometer okay I'm down to
two<00:04:34.370> dowel<00:04:35.150> pins<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.780> there<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:37.009> using<00:04:37.340> this

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
two dowel pins in there and using this

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.499 
two dowel pins in there and using this
stare<00:04:37.970> at<00:04:38.120> mic<00:04:39.849> kind<00:04:40.849> of<00:04:40.940> looking<00:04:41.180> over<00:04:41.389> the

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
stare at mic kind of looking over the

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:49.739 
stare at mic kind of looking over the
camera<00:04:41.750> here's<00:04:42.110> those<00:04:42.289> awkward

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:55.920 

and<00:04:50.749> there<00:04:51.020> I'm<00:04:53.499> about<00:04:54.499> a<00:04:54.560> half<00:04:54.680> thousand<00:04:55.340> over

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
and there I'm about a half thousand over

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.659 
and there I'm about a half thousand over
as<00:04:56.930> soon<00:04:57.169> as<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.349> regular<00:04:57.710> old<00:04:57.860> Mike<00:04:58.159> here<00:04:58.490> now

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
as soon as the regular old Mike here now

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.999 
as soon as the regular old Mike here now
that<00:04:58.849> I<00:04:58.879> had<00:04:59.090> since<00:04:59.389> I<00:04:59.539> was<00:04:59.719> 16

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.010 

remember<00:05:04.009> the<00:05:04.099> dowel<00:05:04.279> pins<00:05:04.639> are<00:05:04.909> two<00:05:05.779> ten

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
remember the dowel pins are two ten

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.149 
remember the dowel pins are two ten
thousandths<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:07.180> an<00:05:08.180> inch<00:05:08.270> over<00:05:08.449> two<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.949> that

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
thousandths of an inch over two so that

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:19.360 
thousandths of an inch over two so that
they<00:05:10.310> will<00:05:10.430> press<00:05:10.729> in<00:05:17.979> there<00:05:18.979> we're<00:05:19.159> pretty

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
they will press in there we're pretty

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:28.850 
they will press in there we're pretty
much<00:05:19.550> right<00:05:19.819> on

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:47.120 

let's<00:05:29.580> see<00:05:30.380> slipping<00:05:31.380> off<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.800> me<00:05:43.700> well<00:05:46.130> with

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
let's see slipping off on me well with

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.610 
let's see slipping off on me well with
and<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> half<00:05:47.490> thousand<00:05:48.030> ther<00:05:48.240> so<00:05:48.870> I'm<00:05:49.320> real

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
and a half thousand ther so I'm real

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.270 
and a half thousand ther so I'm real
satisfied<00:05:50.190> with<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.400> results<00:05:50.820> of<00:05:51.000> this<00:05:52.280> last
