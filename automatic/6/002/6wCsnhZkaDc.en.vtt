game with like the whole forza horizon
kind<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:26.000> ideal<00:02:26.510> it'll<00:02:26.990> probably<00:02:27.350> make<00:02:27.590> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
kind of ideal it'll probably make it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
thing I didn't see was damaged there was

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.890 
thing I didn't see was damaged there was
a<00:02:48.830> lot<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.070> times<00:02:49.370> where<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.940> Viper<00:02:50.270> would

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
a lot of times where the Viper would

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.750 
a lot of times where the Viper would
crash<00:02:51.200> into<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.530> car<00:02:51.830> or<00:02:52.160> crash<00:02:52.400> into<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> wall

crash into a car or crash into a wall

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.390 
crash into a car or crash into a wall
and<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.600> wouldn't<00:02:53.900> even<00:02:53.960> get<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> scratch<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:55.070> so

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and it wouldn't even get a scratch on so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.800 
and it wouldn't even get a scratch on so
I<00:02:55.430> don't<00:02:55.640> know<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:56.030> maybe<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> demo

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
I don't know if maybe in the demo

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.690 
I don't know if maybe in the demo
Assante<00:02:57.230> damage<00:02:57.620> turned<00:02:57.890> off<00:02:58.190> for<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.520> sake

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700

Assante damage turned off for the sake
of<00:02:58.730> demo<00:02:59.210> or<00:02:59.810> maybe<00:03:00.170> they're<00:03:00.320> just<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.620> done

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.840 
there's got to be some form of damage
doing<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.600> them<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.290> add<00:03:06.560> damage<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.730> it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
doing for them to add damage and it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.670 
doing for them to add damage and it
really<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.540> can't<00:03:08.750> be<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> hard<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.500> get

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
really is it can't be that hard to get

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.440 
really is it can't be that hard to get
some<00:03:09.950> kind<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.280> damage<00:03:10.640> into<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:10.970> game<00:03:11.209> it's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
some kind of damage into this game it's

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.660 
some kind of damage into this game it's
running<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.690> Forza<00:03:12.110> 4<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.470> engine<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.459> should

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
running on Forza 4 is engine it should

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.150 
running on Forza 4 is engine it should
be<00:03:13.700> able<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.540> at<00:03:14.780> least<00:03:14.810> Forza<00:03:15.530> 4<00:03:15.800> level

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
be able to have at least Forza 4 level

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.070 
be able to have at least Forza 4 level
damage<00:03:16.520> I<00:03:16.610> would<00:03:16.640> hope<00:03:16.940> anyway<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.780> would<00:03:17.900> kind

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
damage I would hope anyway it would kind

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.120 
damage I would hope anyway it would kind
of<00:03:18.110> detract<00:03:18.500> from<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> open<00:03:19.010> world

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
of detract from the open world

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.850 
of detract from the open world
experience<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.850> didn't<00:03:20.209> now<00:03:20.930> one

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
experience of it didn't now one

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.550 
experience of it didn't now one
statement<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.459> was<00:03:22.550> made<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.350> can

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
statement that was made is if you can

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.360 
statement that was made is if you can
see<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.820> drive<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:28.220> that

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
see it you can drive to it so in that

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.280 
see it you can drive to it so in that
sense<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:29.060> kind<00:03:29.270> of<00:03:29.330> like<00:03:29.450> how<00:03:29.630> Skyrim

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
sense it's kind of like how Skyrim

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.780 
sense it's kind of like how Skyrim
always<00:03:30.560> brags<00:03:30.800> about<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.190> see<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.489> mountain

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
always brags about you see that mountain

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.640 
always brags about you see that mountain
yeah<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.060> can<00:03:32.209> get<00:03:32.300> on<00:03:32.390> top<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.380> not<00:03:33.530> in

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
yeah I can get on top of that but not in

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.890 
yeah I can get on top of that but not in
that<00:03:33.709> sense<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:34.280> can't<00:03:34.520> like<00:03:34.760> drive<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.600> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
that sense you can't like drive up the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.320 
that sense you can't like drive up the
cliffs<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:37.130> um<00:03:37.370> you're<00:03:37.640> gonna<00:03:37.730> be<00:03:37.940> able<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.270> at

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
cliffs but um you're gonna be able to at

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.560 
cliffs but um you're gonna be able to at
least<00:03:38.450> drive<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.110> foot<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.800> cliff<00:03:40.160> so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
least drive to the foot of the cliff so

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.510 
least drive to the foot of the cliff so
it's<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:42.020> good<00:03:42.320> thing<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.650> means<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.250> world

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
it's a good thing that means the world

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.490 
it's a good thing that means the world
should<00:03:43.970> be<00:03:44.060> pretty<00:03:44.330> big<00:03:44.750> now<00:03:44.959> he<00:03:45.020> said<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
should be pretty big now he said the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.340 
should be pretty big now he said the
render<00:03:46.040> distance<00:03:46.220> for<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.970> world<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.450> 20

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
render distance for the world is 20

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.560 
render distance for the world is 20
kilometers<00:03:48.980> which<00:03:49.190> works<00:03:49.430> out<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.670> about<00:03:49.910> 12

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
kilometers which works out to about 12

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.900 
kilometers which works out to about 12
miles<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.950> if<00:03:52.040> you're<00:03:52.160> sitting<00:03:52.340> in<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.730> middle

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
miles so if you're sitting in the middle

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.809 
miles so if you're sitting in the middle
of<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.209> world

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
of the world

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.630 
of the world
and<00:03:53.939> you<00:03:54.060> can<00:03:54.239> render<00:03:54.680> 20<00:03:55.680> kilometers<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.519> you

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
and you can render 20 kilometers and you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.789 
and you can render 20 kilometers and you
can<00:03:56.819> if<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.209> see<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.019> drive<00:03:58.530> to

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
can if you can see it you can drive to

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.280 
can if you can see it you can drive to
it<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.609> means<00:03:59.849> roughly<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.719> world<00:04:01.049> would

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
it that means roughly the world would

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.489 
it that means roughly the world would
work<00:04:01.439> out<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.769> about<00:04:02.269> 450<00:04:03.269> miles<00:04:03.810> if<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.349> was<00:04:04.469> a

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:04.499 
work out to about 450 miles if it was a

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.690 
work out to about 450 miles if it was a
circle<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.129> were<00:04:05.219> right<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.609> middle

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
circle and you were right in the middle

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.819 
circle and you were right in the middle
of<00:04:05.939> it<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.749> either<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.319> world's<00:04:07.560> going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> be

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
of it so either the world's going to be

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.800 
of it so either the world's going to be
that<00:04:08.040> big<00:04:08.310> or<00:04:08.609> you're<00:04:09.120> gonna<00:04:09.180> be<00:04:09.389> rendering

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
that big or you're gonna be rendering

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.709 
that big or you're gonna be rendering
things<00:04:10.109> 20<00:04:10.530> miles<00:04:10.709> away<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:12.120> can't<00:04:12.510> get

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
things 20 miles away and you can't get

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.780 
things 20 miles away and you can't get
to<00:04:12.870> them<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.439> like<00:04:13.799> maybe<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.099> tree<00:04:14.459> off<00:04:14.639> in

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
to them like like maybe a tree off in

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.009 
to them like like maybe a tree off in
the<00:04:14.849> distance<00:04:15.030> I'm<00:04:15.299> not<00:04:15.389> really<00:04:15.540> sure<00:04:15.629> but<00:04:15.900> he

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the distance I'm not really sure but he

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.009 
the distance I'm not really sure but he
did<00:04:16.229> say<00:04:16.500> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:17.160> can<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.660> drive

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
did say if you can see it you can drive

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.469 
did say if you can see it you can drive
to<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.680> off<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:21.209> could<00:04:21.389> be

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
to it so going off of that it could be

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.170 
to it so going off of that it could be
about<00:04:21.630> 400<00:04:22.349> miles<00:04:22.500> big<00:04:23.130> which<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> massive

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
about 400 miles big which is a massive

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.800 
about 400 miles big which is a massive
world<00:04:24.479> now<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.949> day/night<00:04:26.550> cycle<00:04:26.849> is<00:04:27.210> coming

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
world now the day/night cycle is coming

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.779 
world now the day/night cycle is coming
to<00:04:27.900> four<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:28.229> that's<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.500> new<00:04:28.830> thing<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.490> fourth

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
to four so that's a new thing the fourth

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.390 
to four so that's a new thing the fourth
series<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.419> going<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.960> be<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> dynamic<00:04:31.470> cycle<00:04:32.250> it

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
series is going to be a dynamic cycle it

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.460 
series is going to be a dynamic cycle it
said<00:04:32.820> it's<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.000> 24-hour<00:04:33.539> cycle<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.320> I'm

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
said it's a 24-hour cycle so I'm

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.170 
said it's a 24-hour cycle so I'm
assuming<00:04:34.560> you're<00:04:35.460> gonna<00:04:35.580> be<00:04:35.759> able<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.060> just

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
assuming you're gonna be able to just

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.820 
assuming you're gonna be able to just
let<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:36.570> go<00:04:36.599> through<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.349> cycle<00:04:37.560> because

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
let it go through the cycle because

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.499 
let it go through the cycle because
there's<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.039> lot<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.220> game<00:04:38.460> plays<00:04:38.729> like<00:04:39.030> sunset

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
there's a lot of game plays like sunset
