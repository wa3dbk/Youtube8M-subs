this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> battery<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.860> enough<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this is the battery it's a bit enough to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
this is the battery it's a bit enough to
be<00:00:38.399> honest<00:00:38.700> though<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
be honest though if you can see that the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.639 
be honest though if you can see that the
three<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> cells<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.820> rounded<00:00:42.149> off<00:00:42.649> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
three of the cells are rounded off so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.729 
three of the cells are rounded off so
it's<00:00:43.829> not<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.989> best<00:00:45.989> battery<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> van

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it's not the best battery to be a van

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's not the best battery to be a van
over<00:00:46.860> winter<00:00:48.469> drop<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:51.500> right<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.620> fire

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
over winter drop this right will fire

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:11.030 
over winter drop this right will fire
out<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> then
