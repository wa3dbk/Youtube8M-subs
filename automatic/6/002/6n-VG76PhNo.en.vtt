00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the new one and then reassemble we are

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.089 
the new one and then reassemble we are
the<00:00:23.670> first<00:00:23.910> step<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.900> get<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> back<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.740> the

to do next is disconnect the battery

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
to do next is disconnect the battery
here<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.070> sure<00:00:32.219> there's<00:00:32.430> no<00:00:32.550> power<00:00:32.790> in

here to make sure there's no power in
the<00:00:33.149> device<00:00:33.390> whatsoever<00:00:33.860> then<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.520> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the device whatsoever then I'm going to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
the device whatsoever then I'm going to
disconnect<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> screen<00:00:36.660> itself<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
disconnect the screen itself which is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
disconnect the screen itself which is
this<00:00:37.620> connector<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.100> exactly<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.239> same<00:00:39.420> as

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
this connector here exactly the same as

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.590

that<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that one there and then to get a bit of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
that one there and then to get a bit of
an<00:00:42.750> understanding<00:00:43.309> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> screen<00:00:44.700> itself

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
an understanding of the screen itself

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
an understanding of the screen itself
it's<00:00:45.420> pretty<00:00:45.629> much<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.840> stop<00:00:46.320> down<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.980> Adi

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
it's pretty much just stop down with Adi

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
it's pretty much just stop down with Adi
save<00:00:48.050> all<00:00:49.050> around<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> edge<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.399> need

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
save all around the edge we'll just need

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.939 
save all around the edge we'll just need
to<00:00:50.820> sort<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> peel<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:53.329> choose<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
to sort of peel off choose from here and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
to sort of peel off choose from here and
then<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:58.320> DS<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> already<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.539> once

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then the DS is already there so once

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.900 
then the DS is already there so once
I've<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> battery<00:01:01.920> disconnected<00:01:02.730> I'm

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
I've got the battery disconnected I'm

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
I've got the battery disconnected I'm
going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> remove<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.290> screen<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

away<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.610> adhesive<00:01:30.150> here<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> was

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
away from the adhesive here and I was

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
away from the adhesive here and I was
going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:32.280> break<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> way

going to do was break it all the way
from<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> adhesive<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.320> peel<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
from the adhesive then just peel the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140 
from the adhesive then just peel the
adhesive<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> rest<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> screen

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
adhesive off from the rest of the screen

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.980 
adhesive off from the rest of the screen
will<00:01:36.329> come<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
will come with it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
will come with it
I've<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> discovered<00:01:38.009> though<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
I've kind of discovered though that the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
I've kind of discovered though that the
adhesive<00:01:39.439> isn't<00:01:40.439> too<00:01:40.680> hard<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:41.549> at

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
adhesive isn't too hard to get off at

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
adhesive isn't too hard to get off at
the<00:01:42.240> moment<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.890> doing<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the moment so what I'm doing in is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670 
the moment so what I'm doing in is
working<00:01:45.240> underneath<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.960> ed7

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
working underneath the ed7

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
working underneath the ed7
I'm<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.130> try<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> strip<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm just going to try and strip the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.550 
I'm just going to try and strip the
adhesive<00:01:48.750> off<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.320> whole<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:51.060> frame

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
adhesive off the whole of the frame

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.539 
adhesive off the whole of the frame
hopefully<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> glass<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.040> come<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
hopefully the glass will come with it

were no shadows of glass on that could

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.069 
were no shadows of glass on that could
stop<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:12.969> screen<00:03:13.209> from<00:03:13.419> going<00:03:13.689> down<00:03:13.870> and
