contours<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.170> face<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> take<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:38.970> brush

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
contours of your face so I take my brush

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350 
contours of your face so I take my brush
in<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> angle<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.360> right

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
in this kind of angle right here right

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.590 
in this kind of angle right here right
underneath<00:01:42.630> where<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:44.100> main<00:01:44.880> line<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> my

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
underneath where this main line of my

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
underneath where this main line of my
cheekbone<00:01:46.049> goes<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> take

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
cheekbone goes in so I'm going to take

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.490 
cheekbone goes in so I'm going to take
the<00:01:47.939> brush<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:49.549> having<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> angled

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the brush and having it angled

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
the brush and having it angled
perpendicular<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.009> plane<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.579> face

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
perpendicular to the plane of my face

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
perpendicular to the plane of my face
this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.110> temple<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.829> start<00:01:56.070> right

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this is more my temple as I start right

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.300 
this is more my temple as I start right
underneath<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:57.229> then<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.590> sort<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.950> tap

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
underneath there then I just sort of tap

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.090 
underneath there then I just sort of tap
this<00:01:59.549> into<00:01:59.909> my

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
this into my

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.270 
this into my
skin<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.790> bring<00:02:01.689> it<00:02:01.840> forward<00:02:02.049> along<00:02:03.009> that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
skin and bring it forward along that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.690 
skin and bring it forward along that
same<00:02:03.580> line<00:02:03.930> usually<00:02:04.930> what<00:02:05.290> I'll<00:02:05.439> do<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.950> have

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
same line usually what I'll do is have

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.270 
same line usually what I'll do is have
more<00:02:07.060> pigment<00:02:07.509> near<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.930> hairline<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.069> then

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
more pigment near the hairline and then

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.809 
more pigment near the hairline and then
less<00:02:09.550> as<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:09.850> goes<00:02:10.179> forward<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.640> has

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
less as it goes forward just so it has

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.270 
less as it goes forward just so it has
this<00:02:13.060> sort<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.450> gradient<00:02:13.930> effect<00:02:14.319> just

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
this sort of gradient effect just

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.350 
this sort of gradient effect just
because<00:02:15.489> when<00:02:15.670> you're<00:02:15.790> looking<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.270> from

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
because when you're looking at it from

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870 
because when you're looking at it from
the<00:02:16.510> front<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:17.709> want<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> far<00:02:18.280> areas

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
the front you really want the far areas

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.570 
the front you really want the far areas
to<00:02:19.209> sort<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.720> look<00:02:19.959> more<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.560> shadow<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.430> your

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
to sort of look more like shadow on your

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.000 
to sort of look more like shadow on your
face<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.870> want<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.350> scream

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
face you don't really want it to scream

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.030 
face you don't really want it to scream

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
little triangle and as I go forward I

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.120 
little triangle and as I go forward I
bring<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.360> down<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.959> sort<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> cup<00:02:41.860> this

people say this all the time this is the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.729 
people say this all the time this is the
apple<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.280> your<00:02:51.310> cheek<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.290> contour

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
apple of your cheek this is the contour

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.039 
apple of your cheek this is the contour
area<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.209> where<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> highlight

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
area and this is where the highlight

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.500 
area and this is where the highlight
would<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.769> again<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.940> Apple<00:02:59.340> contour

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
would be so again the Apple contour

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
highlight actually the highlight is kind

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.250 
highlight actually the highlight is kind
of<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.580> area<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.090> school<00:03:04.630> see<00:03:04.930> shape

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
of this area the school see shape

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.310 
of this area the school see shape
because<00:03:06.010> if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.280> look<00:03:06.549> this<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.170> this

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
because if you look this this and this

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.550 
because if you look this this and this
is<00:03:08.620> where<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.010> lights<00:03:09.220> hitting<00:03:09.489> my<00:03:09.970> face

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
is where the lights hitting my face

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.050 
is where the lights hitting my face
naturally<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.160> those<00:03:12.340> are<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.640> places<00:03:12.760> you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
naturally so those are the places you

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.699 
naturally so those are the places you
want<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> highlight<00:03:13.840> with<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.019> highlighter<00:03:14.470> and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
want to highlight with a highlighter and

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.370 
want to highlight with a highlighter and
then<00:03:15.220> this<00:03:15.549> area<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.299> where<00:03:16.600> my<00:03:16.900> face<00:03:17.140> is

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
then this area is where my face is

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.770 
then this area is where my face is
getting<00:03:17.739> shadow<00:03:18.160> naturally<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.600> just

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
getting shadow naturally so you just

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.810 
getting shadow naturally so you just
want<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.049> enhance<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.829> again

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820

underneath it right here I'm going to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.740 
underneath it right here I'm going to
tap<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.220> into<00:03:30.640> my<00:03:30.910> skin<00:03:31.180> bringing<00:03:31.600> it

underneath this area in the front and

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
underneath this area in the front and
that<00:03:51.440> way<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:51.920> really<00:03:52.190> easy<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:53.030> get<00:03:53.209> an<00:03:53.540> even

blush<00:03:55.310> line<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.940> might<00:03:56.450> be<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> little<00:03:56.900> dark<00:03:57.110> on

blush line it might be a little dark on

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.840 
blush line it might be a little dark on
this<00:03:57.470> side<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:57.860> that's<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.250> because<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
this side but that's just because the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.970 
this side but that's just because the
Sun<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.360> coming<00:03:59.690> from<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.110> direction<00:04:00.170> I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
Sun is coming from this direction I

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.190 
Sun is coming from this direction I
promise<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.520> in<00:04:01.610> real<00:04:01.790> life<00:04:02.000> they<00:04:02.660> are<00:04:02.810> even

promise you in real life they are even

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.680 
promise you in real life they are even
but<00:04:03.709> yeah<00:04:03.860> that's<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.550> really<00:04:04.850> nice<00:04:05.330> and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
but yeah that's it it's really nice and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.990 
but yeah that's it it's really nice and
quick<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:05.959> easy<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.100> natural<00:04:07.610> way<00:04:07.790> of

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
quick and easy and a natural way of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.120 
quick and easy and a natural way of
applying<00:04:08.239> blush<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.260> think<00:04:09.770> sort<00:04:10.040> of

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
applying blush that I think sort of

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.390 
applying blush that I think sort of
works<00:04:10.910> with<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.420> shape<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.709> your<00:04:12.739> face<00:04:13.070> but

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
works with the shape of your face but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.190 
works with the shape of your face but
the<00:04:13.489> next<00:04:13.820> step<00:04:14.000> I'm<00:04:14.180> going<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.540> go<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the next step I'm going to go to is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.440 
the next step I'm going to go to is
highlighting<00:04:15.890> my<00:04:16.040> cheeks<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.970> for<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.269> I'm

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
highlighting my cheeks so for that I'm

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.900 
highlighting my cheeks so for that I'm
using<00:04:17.660> my<00:04:17.840> dior<00:04:18.380> shimmer<00:04:18.739> powder<00:04:18.980> in<00:04:19.400> amber

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
so I usually do this section first I

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.760 
so I usually do this section first I
start<00:05:26.150> from<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.450> outside<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.960> I<00:05:27.229> just<00:05:27.440> sweep

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
start from the outside and I just sweep

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.060 
start from the outside and I just sweep
this<00:05:28.039> inward<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:29.229> don't<00:05:30.229> want<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.740> look<00:05:31.010> like

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
this inward I don't want it to look like

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.550 
this inward I don't want it to look like
really<00:05:31.760> sparkly<00:05:32.479> and<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.780> also<00:05:32.930> don't<00:05:33.229> want<00:05:33.470> to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
really sparkly and I also don't want to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.620 
really sparkly and I also don't want to
look<00:05:33.680> greasy<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.850> kind<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.180> have<00:05:35.360> to<00:05:35.390> be

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
look greasy so you kind of have to be

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.450 
look greasy so you kind of have to be
careful<00:05:36.020> not<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.320> go<00:05:36.410> too<00:05:36.440> far<00:05:36.919> down<00:05:36.979> because

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
careful not to go too far down because

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.580 
careful not to go too far down because
sometimes<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.539> glitter<00:05:38.840> particles<00:05:39.229> get

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
sometimes the glitter particles get

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.050 
sometimes the glitter particles get
stuck<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:39.979> your<00:05:40.100> pores<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.460> that's<00:05:40.700> not<00:05:40.910> very

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
stuck in your pores and that's not very

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.180 
stuck in your pores and that's not very
flattering<00:05:41.360> if<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.320> have<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.560> lot<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:42.860> fine

glittery and more glowy if that makes

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.690 
glittery and more glowy if that makes
