00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 The game was actually after eleven 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.549
 minutes you had the impression you had 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.309
 as a television viewer and then came the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.099
 for kÃ¼r was back Christoph with you 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 schnick schnack schnuck from the free kick 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
 we'll take a look at that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 there was negotiation then kick 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.119
 and then we start in ribÃ©ry and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 kroos ribery has won sovereign 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 that will be the bavarian again 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 designed as arrogance also quite 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.420
 You can see that against the opponent 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 Something like that is definitely part of it 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 of arrogance could even be me 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 this is also part of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.780
 of a strategy this is me san 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.430
 to document everything to me 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 we can afford it now 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
 To make a joke of that level too 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.829
 the players already know completely 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.440
 just that in every situation 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.789
 be lit from filmed 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 That's why they must have realized that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.010
 his 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 Of course, I find it unsportsmanlike 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 no no wonder so what makes 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.730
 you just can not believe it anyway 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.960
 that there are demonstrations 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.390
 So boys do sports 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 they enjoy the fun of the sport 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 and only by the fact that all 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.150
 cameras you have to watch there 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 not meanwhile I seem so 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 I did not play football myself 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.970
 but I know that if we are such 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.740
 things may have had just fun and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 if you play with 15 games why 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 We must not do that one is it 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 of course by the cameras, it is then 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.610
 maybe again a spark reprehensible 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.259
 but I think that should be the one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.490
 allow athletes to gamblers 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.490
 that they do things like that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.530
 ingo lenz tag ice hockey, so to speak 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.380
 also played higher class so the white 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.060
 but how team sports are possible 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.789
 The boys also made the stand 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.710
 from 0 0 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.420
 I think I'm born here 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 Unfortunately I had to contradict him 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.840
 I finds the opponents against 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.280
 disrespectful 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.079
 That's what you do not belong to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.759
 These are all colleagues somewhere 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.520
 of course play against each other for 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.970
 other teams everyone heard that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.970
 not for football 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:34.940
 what not 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.940
 come early
