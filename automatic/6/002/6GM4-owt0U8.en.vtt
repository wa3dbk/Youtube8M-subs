with this widget I can just see a

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.870 
with this widget I can just see a
percentage<00:05:31.159> which<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:32.030> lot<00:05:32.599> more<00:05:32.630> useful

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880

that it doesn't only just tell you the
percentage<00:05:39.349> of<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.710> battery<00:05:40.039> left<00:05:40.310> if<00:05:40.580> you

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
percentage of the battery left if you

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.180 
percentage of the battery left if you
actually<00:05:41.210> click<00:05:41.659> it<00:05:41.870> it'll<00:05:42.710> launch<00:05:42.979> that
