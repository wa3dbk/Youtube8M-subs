00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.990
 very good to all youtube people if 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.120
 you know something good this time we're 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.460
 in a very fast tutorial which is going to 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.030
 try to improve the performance of 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.030
 planet site 2 how to reduce the lag of 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.250
 planet 62 and good the plan set 2 is a 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.440
 game which is pretty bad 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.710
 optimized by sony that his 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.240
 developer since planet 2 uses 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.100
 more what is the cpu what is the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.190
 processor that the graphics card of the 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.950
 gpu 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.020
 and good on many computers this gives 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.390
 problems in others do not give for some 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
 it's benefit to others, not in my case 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.320
 I have a computer that good most 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.750
 of games have gone pretty well 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.850
 planet 62 for the graphics it has and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.370
 that should be a game that should 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.690
 to go perfectly but unfortunately 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.239
 it's not like that, it's not like that and this is because it's 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.650
 a game that is itself badly created 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.970
 for some computers and others yes 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.160
 that is good for computers that 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.869
 they are powerful that I might give them 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.150
 problems and others that are little 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.710
 powerful and go perfect is not a 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.530
 weird thing he has done is and well 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 I extract 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.820
 a small file that will help you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.040
 improve our performance according 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.080
 you will have the download link in the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.330
 description of agreement simply 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.920
 we come to our browser 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.509
 nothing we open what is the link of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.030
 download the download link of the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.920
 mega server the truth that a server 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.600
 that we go very very well and good here 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.580
 we will have the file will simply be 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.290
 click on download I recommend you 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.409
 to download on this server 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.630
 you use google chrome since there 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.539
 some browsers that present 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.399
 some problems when downloading 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.050
 with that server and well we go there what 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.179
 that I leave you is a point file for this 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.009
 what you see here will be a run file or 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.700
 compressed and good file is 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.159
 we just open it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 and here we have this so we go into 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.640
 the folder and there will be some instructions 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.990
 but go the instructions are 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.299
 basically the same thing that I 'm going to tell you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.130
 I now copy and paste to the file and user 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.350
 options in the installation directory 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 of planet site 2 and good not after a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.190
 Change in the performance of quite 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.500
 good according to the file and user 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 options is this that you see in agreement this 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.790
 you see here this second file and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.739
 good to do, we have to go to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.360
 our plan directory 62 where what 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.640
 have installed in accordance and I in my 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.319
 case I've downloaded it from steam so 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.319
 so much I have it in the steam folder in 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:34.560
 my case this program files 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.499
 steam steam apps common planetside 2 and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 here in the plans folder and 2 is 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.909
 where we should paste this file is worth 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.000
 in my case I'm going to drag it 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.040
 dragged and we simply give to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.420
 replace the file in the destination of 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.970
 agreement 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.430
 click on replace the file and now 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.380
 would be ready what is the file already 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.080
 I would be ready and good at this time already 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.970
 we would be noticing a noticeable change in 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.670
 our game performance in the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.010
 planet 2 performance we will notice a 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.270
 pretty good and good change nothing 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 I hope you serve this has been all 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.100
 I hope you liked it and I said goodbye 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.940
 we see in the next video until the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.180
 next 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.180
