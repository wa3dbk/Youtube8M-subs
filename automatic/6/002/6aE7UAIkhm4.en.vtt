yeah spent and pick it up again this
piece<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.340> metal<00:02:50.890> thinking<00:02:51.890> about<00:02:53.769> cutting

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
piece of metal thinking about cutting

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.670 
piece of metal thinking about cutting
part<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.440> off

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.099 

notlikethis<00:03:01.370> I'm<00:03:02.000> probably<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.599> cut<00:03:02.900> about

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
notlikethis I'm probably just cut about

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.030 
notlikethis I'm probably just cut about
you<00:03:03.590> know<00:03:03.680> maybe<00:03:04.989> here<00:03:05.989> in<00:03:06.969> here<00:03:07.969> and<00:03:08.799> put<00:03:09.799> this

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
you know maybe here in here and put this

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.509 
you know maybe here in here and put this
piece<00:03:10.370> weld<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.849> right<00:03:11.060> here<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.129> can<00:03:13.340> put

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
piece weld it right here so you can put

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.940 
piece weld it right here so you can put
a<00:03:13.549> lock<00:03:13.790> through<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:15.019> lock<00:03:15.260> your<00:03:15.439> tire<00:03:15.680> on

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
a lock through it and lock your tire on

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.569 
a lock through it and lock your tire on
so<00:03:16.219> they<00:03:16.340> can't<00:03:16.609> get<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.879> off<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:18.549> cut<00:03:19.549> a

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
so they can't get it off and then cut a
