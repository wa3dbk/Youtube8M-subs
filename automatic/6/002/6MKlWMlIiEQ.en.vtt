00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.930
 I believe that a person the most 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.570
 important that you must be sure of 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.170
 foundation and to get to that must 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.020
 knowing yourself very well the makeup is a 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.150
 a lot of detail gives you like the 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.810
 personality of who you are and what you 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 you want to project 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.190
 I realize that I can not have the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.590
 best tools the best brands 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.110
 of base the best shadows the shadows 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.480
 more beautiful but if I do not have the brushes 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.720
 indicated so that I can apply the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.360
 makeup then I will not achieve anything 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.820
 I can buy any brand of brush 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.489
 as long as the brushes do not release 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.470
 your hairs any type of brush 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.129
 you can achieve good makeup there is no 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.129
 no problem 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.420
 this is the brush where we started the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.220
 makeup to apply the corrections 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 we use them in the contour of the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.619
 eye in the tec area and on the chin to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
 highlight the points of light and let them remain 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.140
 in a more uniform way should be a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.950
 a flat brush so it does not accumulate 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 so much both product or treat 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 corrector 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.260
 this is the brush with which we apply 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.900
 the base I recommend this circular 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.820
 because it's going to be more than a 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.310
 report reminds that makeup should 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.970
 to be well neat uniform and always 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.070
 well extended 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.810
 the loose powder that good 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.810
 we use constantly 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.910
 then we came to the brush eyes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 I love it because you have both 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 options one stop to apply the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.370
 shadow and the other is to blur by 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.550
 course is an indispensable brush to 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.280
 the time to make up your eyes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.260
 I use it to delineate the account 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 and well I also love it because 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.560
 part is to outline the eye with shadow 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.560
 wet 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.910
 this brush is good I use it for 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.910
 delineate the lower part of the eye 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.150
 and also of course it 's a brush 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.670
 especially for the eyebrows 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 this is the mix brush I recommend 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 that is also angular 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.770
 left as angular and make it small that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.590
 is not very big because then we 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.760
 we tend to make circles like blotches 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.760
 there in the face that no 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.700
 never say you can not always 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.890
 sit with the conviction that they are going to 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.890
 leave prices and we achieve 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.709
 and all 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.230
 two 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.110
 all right 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.110
 i
