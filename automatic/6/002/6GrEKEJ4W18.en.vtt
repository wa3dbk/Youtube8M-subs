you guys have heard of that because it

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.300 
you guys have heard of that because it
is<00:02:37.690> by<00:02:37.870> far<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.230> most<00:02:38.500> fun<00:02:38.770> ride<00:02:38.800> cymbal<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
is by far the most fun ride cymbal to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.500 
is by far the most fun ride cymbal to
play<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.670> we've<00:02:39.790> ever<00:02:39.970> encountered<00:02:40.150> here

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
play that we've ever encountered here

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.800 
play that we've ever encountered here
the<00:02:41.410> 18<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.160> 20<00:02:42.400> inch<00:02:42.520> crashes<00:02:43.060> are<00:02:43.209> based<00:02:43.510> on

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the 18 and 20 inch crashes are based on

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
the 18 and 20 inch crashes are based on
the<00:02:44.020> artisan<00:02:44.410> series<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.069> then<00:02:45.580> they<00:02:45.670> have

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the artisan series and then they have

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.580 
the artisan series and then they have
the<00:02:45.910> sound<00:02:46.150> control<00:02:46.600> edge<00:02:46.810> what<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.380> means

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the sound control edge what that means

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.589 
the sound control edge what that means
is<00:02:47.800> there's<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.489> ring<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.880> hammering<00:02:49.239> around

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
is there's a ring of hammering around

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.809 
is there's a ring of hammering around
the<00:02:49.690> outer<00:02:49.870> edge<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.470> another<00:02:51.069> one<00:02:51.280> almost

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
the outer edge and another one almost

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.340 
the outer edge and another one almost
right<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.450> edge<00:02:52.569> which<00:02:52.930> caused<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
right on the edge which caused the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.860 
right on the edge which caused the
symbol<00:02:53.769> profile<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.430> slope<00:02:54.730> outward<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.750> then

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
symbol profile to slope outward and then

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.240 
symbol profile to slope outward and then
get<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> little<00:02:56.290> bit<00:02:56.440> flatter<00:02:56.709> towards<00:02:57.100> the

get a little bit flatter towards the
edge<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:58.360> gives<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> brighter<00:02:59.140> cleaner

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
edge it gives you a brighter cleaner

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.830 
edge it gives you a brighter cleaner

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
rings in a row Bell do well they're

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.349 
rings in a row Bell do well they're
going<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.560> control<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.250> bright<00:03:27.609> attack<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
going to control the bright attack and

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.120 
going to control the bright attack and
give<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.720> slightly<00:03:29.049> darker<00:03:29.440> controlled

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
give it a slightly darker controlled

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.099 
give it a slightly darker controlled
sustain<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:31.299> that<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.510> don't<00:03:31.720> end<00:03:31.810> up<00:03:31.959> with

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
sustain so that you don't end up with

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.140 
sustain so that you don't end up with
something<00:03:32.290> more<00:03:32.590> like<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.799> Sabian<00:03:33.370> vault<00:03:33.730> crash

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
something more like a Sabian vault crash

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940 
something more like a Sabian vault crash
the<00:03:34.660> vault<00:03:34.870> crash<00:03:35.079> is<00:03:35.290> great<00:03:35.560> if<00:03:35.739> what<00:03:35.859> you

the vault crash is great if what you
want<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.250> bright<00:03:36.549> all<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.820> way<00:03:36.940> through<00:03:37.209> this

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
want is bright all the way through this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.960 
want is bright all the way through this
crash<00:03:38.109> has<00:03:38.350> more<00:03:38.530> body<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.040> texture<00:03:39.400> there's

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
crash has more body and texture there's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.690 
crash has more body and texture there's
more<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.750> lot<00:03:40.959> more<00:03:41.019> character<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:42.519> get

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
more to it a lot more character you get

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.910 
more to it a lot more character you get
a<00:03:42.780> bright<00:03:43.780> start<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.440> medium<00:03:45.720> body<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.650> dark

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
a bright start a medium body and a dark

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.009 
a bright start a medium body and a dark
sustain<00:03:48.400> that's<00:03:49.120> not<00:03:49.299> too<00:03:49.450> long<00:03:49.600> it's<00:03:49.810> very

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
sustain that's not too long it's very

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.569 
sustain that's not too long it's very
controllable<00:03:50.620> hence<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> name<00:03:51.190> sound

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
controllable hence the name sound

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.060 
controllable hence the name sound
control<00:03:51.910> crash<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:53.380> these<00:03:53.500> don't<00:03:53.650> die<00:03:53.859> off

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
control crash but these don't die off

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.280 
control crash but these don't die off
like<00:03:54.400> let's<00:03:54.760> say<00:03:54.820> hhx<00:03:55.329> evolutions<00:03:55.870> at<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.019> metal

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
like let's say hhx evolutions at a metal

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.380 
like let's say hhx evolutions at a metal
gig<00:03:56.470> these<00:03:57.130> really<00:03:57.459> punch<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.880> carry<00:03:58.120> they

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
gig these really punch and carry they

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.180 
gig these really punch and carry they
just<00:03:58.570> don't<00:03:58.780> ring<00:03:59.019> out<00:03:59.200> for<00:03:59.530> too<00:03:59.680> long<00:03:59.859> which

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
just don't ring out for too long which

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.710 
just don't ring out for too long which
makes<00:04:00.430> them<00:04:00.579> excellent<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.420> punching

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
makes them excellent for punching

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.330
