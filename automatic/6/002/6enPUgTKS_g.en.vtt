00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
is quite difficult and I'm playing on

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
is quite difficult and I'm playing on
the<00:00:55.649> PC<00:00:55.829> version<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.430> find<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> acts<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the PC version so I find it acts is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
the PC version so I find it acts is
actually<00:00:57.570> quite<00:00:57.750> easy<00:00:57.980> well<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
actually quite easy well you know it's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
actually quite easy well you know it's
not<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.489> easy<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.780> like

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
not that easy but you know it's not like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
not that easy but you know it's not like
ridiculously<00:01:01.500> difficult<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.180> know

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
ridiculously difficult so I don't know

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.800 
ridiculously difficult so I don't know

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
can shoot both at once again and I just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.690 
can shoot both at once again and I just
basically<00:01:14.070> shoot<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.640> gun<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:14.939> once<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
basically shoot one gun at once and I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
basically shoot one gun at once and I
focus<00:01:18.150> basically<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.350> circle

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
focus basically in a kind of a circle

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
focus basically in a kind of a circle
around<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> center<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.080> just<00:01:22.080> forget<00:01:22.290> about

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
around the center and just forget about

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.499 
around the center and just forget about
the<00:01:22.619> ones<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> outside

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.420 

and<00:01:25.719> whenever<00:01:26.289> you<00:01:26.380> get<00:01:26.469> panicky<00:01:26.950> shoot<00:01:27.280> both

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and whenever you get panicky shoot both

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.690 
and whenever you get panicky shoot both
of<00:01:27.490> what<00:01:27.759> both<00:01:28.270> guns<00:01:28.539> at<00:01:28.689> once<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.189> it<00:01:30.310> shoots

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
of what both guns at once and it shoots

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.700 
of what both guns at once and it shoots
down<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.000> asteroid<00:01:31.420> quicker<00:01:31.659> but<00:01:32.350> generally

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
down the asteroid quicker but generally

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.510 
down the asteroid quicker but generally
just<00:01:32.890> shoot<00:01:33.159> one<00:01:33.189> gun<00:01:33.579> at<00:01:33.729> once<00:01:33.909> again<00:01:35.520> shoot

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
just shoot one gun at once again shoot

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.190 
just shoot one gun at once again shoot
one<00:01:36.729> gun

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
one gun

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.610 
one gun
and<00:01:38.380> when<00:01:38.530> an<00:01:38.620> asteroid<00:01:38.979> gets<00:01:39.190> really<00:01:39.490> close

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
and when an asteroid gets really close

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.410 
and when an asteroid gets really close
fired<00:01:41.620> both<00:01:41.830> guts

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.260 

and<00:01:45.420> you'll<00:01:45.689> overheat

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.140 

that's<00:01:49.869> my<00:01:50.079> method

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
that's my method

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.550 
that's my method
don't<00:01:51.450> worry<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.870> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
don't worry about going to the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
don't worry about going to the
extremities<00:01:53.160> they<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:54.060> way<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.630> we're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
extremities they go way up here we're

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.930 
extremities they go way up here we're
here<00:01:55.230> that's<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> take<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.400> out<00:01:56.430> faggot

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
here that's going to take you out faggot

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.720 
here that's going to take you out faggot
just<00:01:57.300> worry<00:01:57.510> about<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.720> ones<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> center

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
just worry about the ones in the center

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.310 
just worry about the ones in the center
go<00:01:59.730> for<00:01:59.940> an<00:02:00.030> average

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:18.600 

instead<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.980> other<00:02:06.130> ones<00:02:06.280> fly<00:02:06.520> by

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.490 

one<00:02:18.850> gets<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:20.020> too<00:02:20.200> close

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
one gets like it's too close

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.980 
one gets like it's too close
-<00:02:21.710> double<00:02:22.130> shit<00:02:22.310> there

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
- double shit there

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.580 
- double shit there
probable<00:02:24.740> gradualist<00:02:25.990> fire<00:02:26.990> both<00:02:27.170> gods<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
probable gradualist fire both gods and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:55.010 
probable gradualist fire both gods and

time there's no asteroid to worry about
so<00:03:44.380> just<00:03:44.440> make<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.770> run<00:03:45.040> for<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.960> it's<00:03:46.960> a

so just make a run for it and it's a

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.130 
so just make a run for it and it's a

couple of leapers I personally wouldn't
take<00:03:50.680> care<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.070> him

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
take care of him

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.930 
take care of him
just<00:03:51.810> speed<00:03:52.810> run<00:03:53.050> around<00:03:53.380> them<00:03:53.530> because<00:03:54.460> you

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
just speed run around them because you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.480 
just speed run around them because you
won't<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.270> enough<00:03:55.510> air<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.960> deal<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.290> them

these<00:04:56.680> lab<00:04:56.950> reports<00:04:57.340> correctly<00:04:57.790> I<00:04:57.820> think<00:04:57.970> I

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
these lab reports correctly I think I

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.240 
these lab reports correctly I think I
can<00:04:58.630> make<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.810> poison<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.470> destroy<00:04:59.860> it

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
can make a poison to destroy it

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.340 
can make a poison to destroy it
head<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.330> medical<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.990> should<00:05:02.230> have

head to medical it should have
everything<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.830> need<00:05:06.840> get<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.960> medical<00:05:08.140> and

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.640 
with I'm heading to hydroponics if I can
slow<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.150> down<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:14.140> might<00:05:14.350> keep<00:05:14.500> us

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
slow it down that might keep us

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:31.620
