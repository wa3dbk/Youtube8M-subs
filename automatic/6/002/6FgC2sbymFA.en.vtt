so<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.659> just<00:00:00.840> learned<00:00:01.079> how<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.290> use<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:02.010> capo<00:00:02.490> in

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so we just learned how to use a capo in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.930 
so we just learned how to use a capo in
the<00:00:02.879> previous<00:00:03.270> lesson<00:00:03.659> but<00:00:04.500> Capo's<00:00:04.940> while

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
the previous lesson but Capo's while

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.880 
the previous lesson but Capo's while
they<00:00:06.150> they<00:00:06.870> were<00:00:06.930> they<00:00:07.080> serve<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> function

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
they they were they serve a function

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.500 
they they were they serve a function
especially<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.490> singer<00:00:08.760> songwriters<00:00:09.300> who

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
especially for singer songwriters who

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.780 
especially for singer songwriters who
really<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:10.410> concentrating<00:00:11.099> only<00:00:11.190> at<00:00:11.429> open

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
really are concentrating only at open

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.049 
really are concentrating only at open
chords<00:00:12.320> they<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.769> limiting<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.820> sense

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
chords they are limiting in a sense

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
chords they are limiting in a sense
because<00:00:15.929> once<00:00:16.379> they're<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.760> no

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
because once they're on you can you no

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.359 
because once they're on you can you no
longer<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.480> your<00:00:18.960> open<00:00:19.470> East<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:20.010> open

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
longer have your open East your open

strings<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.570> play<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.220> another<00:00:23.220> way<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
strings to play on another way of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.089 
strings to play on another way of
creating<00:00:23.910> new<00:00:24.330> chord<00:00:24.630> shapes<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.680> using

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
creating new chord shapes is by using

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
creating new chord shapes is by using
your<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.609> finger<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.660> left<00:00:27.720> hand<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
your first finger on your left hand as a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.859 
your first finger on your left hand as a
bar<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> creating<00:00:29.640> bar<00:00:29.789> shapes<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.570> first

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
bar and creating bar shapes the first

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.490 
bar and creating bar shapes the first
shape<00:00:31.080> we'll<00:00:31.289> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.399> e<00:00:32.669> type<00:00:33.540> Barre

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
shape we'll look at is the e type Barre

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
shape we'll look at is the e type Barre
chord<00:00:34.800> you'll<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> mean

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
chord you'll see what I mean

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.740 
chord you'll see what I mean
so<00:00:36.899> watch<00:00:37.940> here's<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.180> bar<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.600> look

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so watch here's what our bar will look

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
so watch here's what our bar will look
like<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:40.890> thing<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.340> laid<00:00:41.790> across

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
like our first thing will be laid across

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
like our first thing will be laid across
let's<00:00:42.960> say<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.410> example<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> fifth<00:00:44.070> fret<00:00:46.039> I'm

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
let's say for example the fifth fret I'm

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.380 
let's say for example the fifth fret I'm
going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> give<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> enough<00:00:47.670> pressure<00:00:47.940> just

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
going to give it enough pressure just

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.310 
going to give it enough pressure just
that<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:48.989> finger

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
that first finger

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.990 
that first finger
the<00:00:51.800> closer<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:52.219> get<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.550> threat<00:00:52.789> the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
the closer you get to the threat the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.119 
the closer you get to the threat the
better<00:00:53.350> make<00:00:54.350> sure<00:00:54.379> your<00:00:54.620> thumb<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:54.949> right

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
better make sure your thumb is right

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.500 
better make sure your thumb is right
behind<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.579> bar<00:00:56.859> so<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:57.949> really<00:00:58.250> get

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
behind that bar so you really get

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.580 
behind that bar so you really get
an<00:00:59.570> open<00:01:00.380> feeling<00:01:00.649> from<00:01:00.950> it<00:01:01.040> all<00:01:01.190> okay<00:01:02.180> now

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
an open feeling from it all okay now

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.960 
an open feeling from it all okay now
remember<00:01:03.590> how<00:01:03.890> our<00:01:03.920> E<00:01:04.129> major<00:01:04.309> shape<00:01:04.810> had<00:01:05.810> been

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
remember how our E major shape had been

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.719 
remember how our E major shape had been
second<00:01:07.970> fret<00:01:08.270> second<00:01:08.810> fret<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.200> string

G we'll watch this if we use a different

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.130 
G we'll watch this if we use a different
fingering<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.160> E<00:01:16.190> major<00:01:16.460> here<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.990> will

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
fingering for the E major here this will

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.260 
fingering for the E major here this will
ease<00:01:18.259> our<00:01:18.440> third<00:01:18.920> finger<00:01:19.220> our<00:01:19.550> fourth<00:01:19.910> finger

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
ease our third finger our fourth finger

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.539 
ease our third finger our fourth finger
and<00:01:20.300> our<00:01:20.600> second<00:01:21.110> finger<00:01:21.729> instead

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.190 

and<00:01:26.000> we<00:01:26.090> move<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:26.509> shape<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.189> way<00:01:28.280> up

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
and we move this shape all the way up

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.810 
and we move this shape all the way up
and<00:01:30.200> start<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.920> seventh<00:01:31.219> fret<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.549> then

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
and start on the seventh fret and then

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
and start on the seventh fret and then
we<00:01:31.939> apply<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.390> bar<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:34.670> have<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.090> essentially

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
we apply the bar we have the essentially

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.069 
we apply the bar we have the essentially
moved<00:01:36.140> an<00:01:36.380> E<00:01:36.710> major<00:01:36.890> chord<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.899> fifth

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
moved an E major chord up to the fifth

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.529 
moved an E major chord up to the fifth
fret<00:01:39.289> which<00:01:40.219> now<00:01:40.750> has<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.780> bass<00:01:42.110> note<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.560> a
