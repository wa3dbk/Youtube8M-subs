00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.049 

I<00:00:07.189> think<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.309> safe<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.429> say<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> mass<00:00:08.880> effect

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I think it's safe to say the mass effect

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.150 
I think it's safe to say the mass effect

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that actually resolve themselves in such

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.429 
that actually resolve themselves in such
a<00:00:20.609> satisfying<00:00:20.850> way<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.480> mean<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.199> people

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.689 
a satisfying way I mean I think people
were<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> little<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.070> i<00:00:23.100> was<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.519> bit

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
were a little bit i was a little bit

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.950 
were a little bit i was a little bit
unsatisfied<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> ending<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
unsatisfied with the ending of the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
unsatisfied with the ending of the
second<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.580> what<00:00:26.670> happened

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
second one so and that's what happened

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.820 
second one so and that's what happened
for<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.810> things<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> middle

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
for like things that are in the middle

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
for like things that are in the middle
because<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.000> bridge<00:00:30.390> before

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
invested in something in the creative
product<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> requires<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.399> time<00:00:59.850> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
room no movie I think could actually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.539 
room no movie I think could actually
replicate<00:01:31.860> some<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> stuff<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> they're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
replicate some of the stuff that they're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.649 
replicate some of the stuff that they're
showing<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> game<00:01:33.030> sit<00:01:33.270> either<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.540> too

showing in the game sit either be too

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
showing in the game sit either be too
expensive<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.200> look<00:01:34.409> incredibly<00:01:34.979> stupid<00:01:35.310> I
