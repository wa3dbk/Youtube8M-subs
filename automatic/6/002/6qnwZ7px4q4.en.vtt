will say death wish across the back but

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
will say death wish across the back but
that's<00:00:30.420> okay<00:00:30.720> because<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.380> exact

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that's okay because there's the exact

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.200 
that's okay because there's the exact
same<00:00:31.949> shoe<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.110> right<00:00:34.140> there

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
same shoe so you can see right there

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.889 
same shoe so you can see right there
they<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.360> fallens<00:00:37.129> it's<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.899> black

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
they are fallens it's kind of like black

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.900 
they are fallens it's kind of like black
with<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.200> sketch<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:42.290> flat<00:00:43.290> bottom

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
with the sketch you and then flat bottom

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.709 
with the sketch you and then flat bottom
so<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.239> sketch<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.850> but<00:00:47.850> these

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
so you know it's sketch you but these

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
so you know it's sketch you but these
would<00:00:49.110> look<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.710> any<00:00:49.950> regular<00:00:50.219> skate<00:00:50.730> shoe

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
would look like any regular skate shoe

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
would look like any regular skate shoe
but<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> only<00:00:51.690> difference<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.430> they're

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
but the only difference is they're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.619 
but the only difference is they're
supposed<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> change<00:00:54.629> colors<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.390> can<00:00:57.390> see

I try not to skate these until I
reviewed<00:02:05.700> them<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:07.560> why<00:02:07.710> they're<00:02:08.009> not
