 it does not last long his load not 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.780
 really it's a practical application 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 what 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.780

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.039
 first you will follow this link 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:04.920
 sawyer full of nick I'm copying and then 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 links this is this icon this is this thing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 there so it will be the link lalliot he 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.780
 there is one on necessarily so have clicked on 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 the price of water to download on 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 its burns practice it's normal where 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.310
 so we download it sometimes takes 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.829
 the good one can so much the summer charlie I 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 not yet downloaded 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.009
 so after that you would be this file a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.020
 vichy helder file simple 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 when you see so normally you 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820
 click on this a good one here we do 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.270
 still download for you the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.149
 show then after I got up pale 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 in the aude where really an icon like 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.799
 simple either I'm going sweet 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.939
 but the luxi decree multi completely 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.020
 for me since I already have them 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.020
 downloaded and so you arrive with 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.360
 visible then 7 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.690
 nothing more simple you click ben 2 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.610
 there you get on two that's with the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.800
 little square that move like that and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.750
 who also does it like that can you 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.060
 serve to make animations but also 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.240
 so that's all a mess 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.100
 so here's the horde of cameras for 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.690
 move the camera if you want there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.910
 but in a different angle 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:43.720
 so I can move it just 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:51.380
 but also the deviate or moved 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.780
 as if I take it here I think I 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.300
 can turn it here are things like 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.040
 that's the software knowledge 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.070
 this expense that I am putting you ball 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.580

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.520
