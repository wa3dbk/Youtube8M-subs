00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
play good to me i think all he plays was
good<00:01:35.610> me<00:01:36.270> maybe<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> couple<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.079> extra

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
good me maybe got a couple of extra

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
good me maybe got a couple of extra
penalties<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.850> they're<00:01:39.000> known<00:01:39.240> for

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
penalties just because they're known for

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510

the<00:01:39.630> players<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.619> i<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.430> they

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the players like that but i think they

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
the players like that but i think they
play<00:01:41.700> clean<00:01:42.060> stayed<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> really

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
play clean stayed up then it really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289 
play clean stayed up then it really
