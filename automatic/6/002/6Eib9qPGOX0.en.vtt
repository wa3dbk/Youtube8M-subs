00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
Ewings for a short time so it seems a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.820 
Ewings for a short time so it seems a
bit<00:02:00.630> strange<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.080> they<00:02:01.229> produced<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
bit strange that they produced that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.580 
bit strange that they produced that
figure<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:03.930> there's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> rumor<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590

figure but and then there's a rumor of
any<00:02:04.890> wing<00:02:05.130> being<00:02:05.400> produced<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.450> let's<00:02:06.900> just

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
any wing being produced so let's just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.340 
any wing being produced so let's just
hope<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.409> true<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.610> single<00:02:08.970> single<00:02:09.630> as<00:02:10.290> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
hope it's true it's a single single as a
