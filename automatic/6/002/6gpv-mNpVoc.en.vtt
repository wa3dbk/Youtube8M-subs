00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.360 
I'm gonna go a six on Chris just because
they<00:05:50.580> did<00:05:50.820> put<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.030> lot<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.270> nice<00:05:51.419> detail<00:05:51.449> in<00:05:52.110> him

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
they did put a lot of nice detail in him

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.010 
they did put a lot of nice detail in him
but<00:05:53.370> on<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.669> accessory<00:05:54.120> soap<00:05:54.419> he<00:05:54.659> can't<00:05:54.870> hold

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
but on the accessory soap he can't hold

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.209 
but on the accessory soap he can't hold
him<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:55.320> only<00:05:55.440> thing<00:05:55.530> he<00:05:55.650> holds<00:05:55.889> well<00:05:56.039> as<00:05:56.130> the

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
him the only thing he holds well as the

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.870 
him the only thing he holds well as the
shotgun<00:05:56.840> so<00:05:57.840> a<00:05:58.139> six<00:05:58.409> is<00:05:58.560> below<00:05:58.830> average<00:05:59.009> but

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
shotgun so a six is below average but

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.279 
shotgun so a six is below average but
only<00:06:00.030> by<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.240> point<00:06:00.570> which<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:00.990> think<00:06:01.020> he

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
only by a point which I think he

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.950 
only by a point which I think he
deserves<00:06:01.560> a<00:06:01.650> little<00:06:01.740> lower<00:06:02.039> but<00:06:02.599> the<00:06:03.599> detail

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
deserves a little lower but the detail

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.290 
deserves a little lower but the detail
this<00:06:04.080> guy's<00:06:04.259> really<00:06:04.500> fantastic<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.000> Jay
