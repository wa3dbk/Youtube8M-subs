though<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.530> hated<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.160> parasite<00:03:58.610> movie<00:03:58.820> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
though I hated the parasite movie I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.750 
though I hated the parasite movie I
still<00:03:59.329> like<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.840> manga<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.410> anyway<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
still like the manga and anyway so you

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.250 
still like the manga and anyway so you
know<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:02.030> didn't<00:04:02.239> quite<00:04:02.329> ruin<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.810> series<00:04:03.110> but

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
know it didn't quite ruin the series but

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.020 
know it didn't quite ruin the series but
in<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.470> back<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.650> my<00:04:03.829> mind<00:04:04.100> whenever<00:04:04.640> someone

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
in the back of my mind whenever someone

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.789 
in the back of my mind whenever someone
says<00:04:05.120> parasite<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.780> always<00:04:06.079> think<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
says parasite I always think of the

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.020 
says parasite I always think of the
alive<00:04:07.070> actually<00:04:07.370> maybe<00:04:07.549> even<00:04:07.700> being<00:04:07.880> like

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
alive actually maybe even being like

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.330 
alive actually maybe even being like
yeah<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.840> series<00:04:09.140> was<00:04:09.290> good<00:04:09.500> except<00:04:10.040> for<00:04:10.220> that

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
yeah the series was good except for that

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.000 
yeah the series was good except for that
movie<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.540> overall<00:04:11.989> value<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.680> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
movie and so the overall value of that

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.190 
movie and so the overall value of that
series<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.549> believe<00:04:13.880> kinda<00:04:14.480> gets<00:04:14.630> dropped<00:04:14.870> down

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
series I believe kinda gets dropped down

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.140 
series I believe kinda gets dropped down
a<00:04:15.260> level<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:16.250> something<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.760> it

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
a level it is something that it

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.180 
a level it is something that it
shouldn't<00:04:17.600> be<00:04:17.810> in<00:04:18.019> if<00:04:18.229> that<00:04:18.650> live-action

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
shouldn't be in if that live-action

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.620 
shouldn't be in if that live-action
movie<00:04:19.340> wasn't<00:04:19.760> there<00:04:19.910> but<00:04:20.150> then<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.390> course

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
movie wasn't there but then of course

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.380 
movie wasn't there but then of course
once<00:04:20.959> in<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.320> blue<00:04:21.709> moon<00:04:22.010> they<00:04:22.789> bring<00:04:23.060> out<00:04:23.180> an

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
once in a blue moon they bring out an

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.990 
once in a blue moon they bring out an
actual

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000

actual
good<00:04:24.740> live-action<00:04:25.740> adaptation<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.700> manga

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
and anime perfect examples to that I can

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.150 
and anime perfect examples to that I can
think<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.720> first<00:04:30.900> one<00:04:31.050> being<00:04:31.260> Ganz<00:04:31.620> now

think of if the first one being Ganz now

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.340 
think of if the first one being Ganz now
