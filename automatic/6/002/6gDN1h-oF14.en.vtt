since I was a little boy this was the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.090 
since I was a little boy this was the
manufacturing<00:00:55.350> technique<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.039> used

still used today it is very popular it
is<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.829> most<00:01:02.070> popular<00:01:02.840> technique<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
is the most popular technique now this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.289 
is the most popular technique now this
tree<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.369> more<00:01:08.369> molded<00:01:09.000> look

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

this<00:01:10.200> branch<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:12.920> created<00:01:13.920> using<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.400> mold

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this branch is created using a mold

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
this branch is created using a mold
where<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.689> mold<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> they<00:01:16.890> do

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
where they take the mold and they do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
where they take the mold and they do
what's<00:01:17.310> called<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.670> injection<00:01:18.479> they're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
what's called an injection they're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800 
what's called an injection they're
injecting<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.040> plastic<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> mold<00:01:21.240> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
injecting the plastic into the mold in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
injecting the plastic into the mold in
order<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.470> create<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.070> branch<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:24.150> big

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
order to create the branch the big

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
order to create the branch the big
difference<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.110> as<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.310> branch

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
difference is as you can see this branch

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.830 
difference is as you can see this branch
has<00:01:27.000> much<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:27.960> body<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> 3d<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
has much more body it's more of a 3d it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.429 
has much more body it's more of a 3d it
actually<00:01:31.290> creates<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.040> closeness<00:01:33.020> if<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
actually creates the closeness if you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560 
actually creates the closeness if you
actually<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:35.009> individual<00:01:35.790> needles<00:01:36.299> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually see individual needles as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.289 
actually see individual needles as
opposed<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.400> while<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.090> see

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
opposed to this while you can see

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.170 
opposed to this while you can see
individual<00:01:39.990> needles<00:01:40.470> they're<00:01:40.890> flat<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
individual needles they're flat more of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.109 
individual needles they're flat more of
a<00:01:42.299> 2d<00:01:42.840> style<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> they're<00:01:44.640> they're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
a 2d style and they're they're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.889 
a 2d style and they're they're

tree to create the density of the tree

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
tree to create the density of the tree
so<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.850> center<00:03:07.180> pole<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.660> not<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.140> obvious

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so the center pole is not so obvious

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.830

this<00:03:09.280> style<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.850> branch<00:03:10.150> does<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> better<00:03:10.750> job

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
piece is that if you built the tree

to have the traditional light set in it

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.630 
to have the traditional light set in it
which<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.510> one<00:05:05.080> bulb<00:05:05.410> burns<00:05:05.800> out<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.400> rest

along<00:05:55.690> with<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.200> spiny<00:05:56.890> needle<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:57.760> can<00:05:57.880> see

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
along with a spiny needle you can see

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.390 
along with a spiny needle you can see
how<00:05:58.150> thin<00:05:58.540> that<00:05:58.780> needle<00:05:59.140> is<00:05:59.290> and<00:05:59.590> then<00:06:00.040> also<00:06:00.190> we

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
how thin that needle is and then also we

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.340 
how thin that needle is and then also we
have<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.730> spiny<00:06:01.060> needle<00:06:01.510> with<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:01.960> little<00:06:02.260> bit

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
have the spiny needle with a little bit

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.640 
have the spiny needle with a little bit
of<00:06:02.380> bloom<00:06:02.830> on<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.100> end<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.750> grapevine

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
of bloom on the end the the grapevine

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.950 
of bloom on the end the the grapevine
adds<00:06:06.190> an<00:06:06.460> additional<00:06:06.580> kind<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.390> a<00:06:07.480> rustic<00:06:07.720> look

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
adds an additional kind of a rustic look

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.000 
adds an additional kind of a rustic look
and<00:06:08.410> then<00:06:08.980> also<00:06:09.220> we<00:06:09.850> have<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.480> pinecones<00:06:11.170> this

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
and then also we have the pinecones this

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
tree is going to be good obviously in a

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.680

as<00:06:21.040> much<00:06:21.220> ornamentation<00:06:22.180> as<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.590> tree<00:06:23.590> such<00:06:24.100> as

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
as much ornamentation as a tree such as

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.220 
as much ornamentation as a tree such as
this<00:06:24.430> that<00:06:24.640> doesn't<00:06:24.850> have<00:06:25.000> any<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.450> the<00:06:25.660> kind

of options so with that we've we've

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.540 
of options so with that we've we've
talked<00:06:30.910> about<00:06:31.030> comparing<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.320> more<00:06:32.830> advanced

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
talked about comparing the more advanced

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.780 
talked about comparing the more advanced
Christmas<00:06:34.360> tree<00:06:34.600> with<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.590> molded<00:06:36.520> branch

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
tip and the advanced lighting compare

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.110 
tip and the advanced lighting compare
a<00:06:40.260> tree<00:06:41.260> that<00:06:41.410> has<00:06:41.620> the<00:06:42.100> traditional<00:06:42.910> style

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
a tree that has the traditional style

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.240 
a tree that has the traditional style
branches<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> lot<00:06:44.080> of<00:06:44.110> the<00:06:44.290> options<00:06:44.710> it

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
branches and a lot of the options it

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.000 
branches and a lot of the options it
really<00:06:45.580> boils<00:06:45.940> down<00:06:46.000> to<00:06:46.320> your<00:06:47.320> personal
