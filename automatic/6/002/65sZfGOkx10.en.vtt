lot<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.370> people<00:01:55.490> who<00:01:55.820> don't<00:01:56.000> really

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
lot of people who don't really

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.700 
lot of people who don't really
understand<00:01:56.720> how<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:56.930> works<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.350> basically

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
understand how this works it's basically

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.140 
understand how this works it's basically
using<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.190> internet<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.580> transmit<00:01:59.030> your

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
using the internet to transmit your

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.719 
using the internet to transmit your
voice<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.070> breaking<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.190> up<00:02:01.280> into<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.610> number

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
voice and breaking it up into a number

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:02.830 
voice and breaking it up into a number
of<00:02:01.940> different<00:02:02.060> packets<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.720> then

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
of different packets and then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.420 
of different packets and then
reassembling<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.830> other<00:02:03.950> end<00:02:04.190> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
reassembling it on the other end and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.000 
reassembling it on the other end and
again<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.150> there's<00:02:05.540> any<00:02:05.810> type<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.110> high

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
again if there's any type of high

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.759 
again if there's any type of high
internet<00:02:07.460> traffic<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:08.330> issues<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.409> do<00:02:09.560> get

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
internet traffic or issues you do get

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.330 
internet traffic or issues you do get
that<00:02:10.340> loss<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.759> voice<00:02:10.940> or<00:02:11.180> crackling<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.340> it's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that loss of voice or crackling and it's

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.190 
that loss of voice or crackling and it's
not<00:02:13.760> typically<00:02:14.300> there<00:02:14.540> yet<00:02:14.720> as<00:02:14.810> far<00:02:14.840> as<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
not typically there yet as far as the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.430 
not typically there yet as far as the
quality<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> an<00:02:16.100> actual

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
quality of an actual

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.380 
quality of an actual
telephone<00:02:16.920> call<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.000> kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.180> funny

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
telephone call and it's kind of funny

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.790 
telephone call and it's kind of funny
because<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.140> over<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> years<00:02:19.530> we've

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
because you know over the years we've

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.830 
because you know over the years we've
gone<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.160> cell<00:02:20.340> phones<00:02:20.580> &amp;<00:02:20.790> L<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.120> voice<00:02:21.570> over

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
gone with cell phones &amp; L and voice over

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
gone with cell phones &amp; L and voice over
IP<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.500> almost<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.950> telephone<00:02:23.430> call<00:02:23.610> just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
kind of going downhill it's true in a

kind of going downhill it's true in a
way<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.410> guess<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.160> compare<00:02:29.640> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
way and I guess I was going to compare a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.880 
way and I guess I was going to compare a
VoIP<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.210> two<00:02:30.840> cell<00:02:31.050> phones<00:02:31.290> people<00:02:31.650> seem<00:02:31.860> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
VoIP to two cell phones people seem to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.700 
VoIP to two cell phones people seem to
have<00:02:32.070> gotten<00:02:32.250> pretty<00:02:32.550> used<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.440> cell

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
have gotten pretty used to you know cell

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070 
have gotten pretty used to you know cell
phone<00:02:34.920> quality<00:02:35.840> sometimes<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.020> good

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
phone quality sometimes it's good

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.960 
phone quality sometimes it's good
sometimes<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.830> bad<00:02:38.070> sometimes<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.730> can't

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
sometimes it's bad sometimes you can't

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.210 
sometimes it's bad sometimes you can't
make<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> call<00:02:39.450> sometimes<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.710> you're<00:02:40.950> driving

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
make a call sometimes as you're driving

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.180 
make a call sometimes as you're driving
you<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.360> cell<00:02:42.600> dropped<00:02:43.410> your<00:02:43.650> call<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
you know the cell dropped your call and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.160 
you know the cell dropped your call and
you<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.640> call<00:02:45.000> again<00:02:45.330> people<00:02:45.900> seem<00:02:46.080> to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you have to call again people seem to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.630 
you have to call again people seem to
have<00:02:46.320> gotten<00:02:46.470> pretty<00:02:46.710> used<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.460> I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
have gotten pretty used to that and I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.810 
have gotten pretty used to that and I
think<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.480> way<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.930> little<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.370> mp3<00:02:50.370> so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
think in a way it's a little like mp3 so

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.880 
think in a way it's a little like mp3 so
I<00:02:50.850> remember<00:02:51.150> an<00:02:51.270> audio<00:02:51.600> guy<00:02:51.780> telling<00:02:52.200> me<00:02:52.230> way

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I remember an audio guy telling me way

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.740 
I remember an audio guy telling me way
back<00:02:53.070> when<00:02:53.130> all<00:02:53.700> people<00:02:53.940> will<00:02:54.180> never<00:02:54.330> go<00:02:54.600> for

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
back when all people will never go for

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.570 
back when all people will never go for
mp3s<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> quality<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.220> lot<00:02:56.370> lower

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
mp3s because the quality is a lot lower

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.300 
mp3s because the quality is a lot lower
than<00:02:56.880> say<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> CD<00:02:57.930> but<00:02:58.320> people<00:02:58.950> are<00:02:59.040> willing<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
than say a CD but people are willing to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.560 
than say a CD but people are willing to
put<00:02:59.460> up<00:02:59.490> with<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.850> because<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:00.390> get

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
put up with that because they get

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.270 
put up with that because they get
convenience<00:03:01.170> out<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.800> know<00:03:01.920> they<00:03:02.100> can

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
convenience out of it you know they can

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
convenience out of it you know they can
take<00:03:02.580> them<00:03:02.850> places<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.600> can<00:03:03.660> they're<00:03:04.320> more

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
take them places they can they're more

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.260 
take them places they can they're more
mobile<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.550> cell<00:03:05.760> phones<00:03:06.000> are<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
mobile and I think cell phones are the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.120 
mobile and I think cell phones are the
same<00:03:06.510> people<00:03:06.990> are<00:03:07.230> willing<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.800> up<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
same people are willing to put up with a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160 
same people are willing to put up with a
certain<00:03:08.460> amount<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.900> deterioration<00:03:09.900> in

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
certain amount of deterioration in

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.720 
certain amount of deterioration in
quality<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.070> get<00:03:11.220> other<00:03:11.400> things

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
quality because they get other things

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.760 
quality because they get other things
out<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.150> well<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.530> know<00:03:13.620> for

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
out of it well I think it's you know for

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.680 
out of it well I think it's you know for
a<00:03:13.800> lot<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.950> people<00:03:14.070> especially<00:03:14.640> at<00:03:15.180> home<00:03:15.420> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
a lot of people especially at home and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.630 
a lot of people especially at home and
who<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.380> make<00:03:16.530> long<00:03:17.100> distance<00:03:17.130> calls

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
who do make long distance calls

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.740 
who do make long distance calls
obviously<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> prices<00:03:18.990> are<00:03:19.580> way<00:03:20.580> cheaper<00:03:21.120> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
obviously the prices are way cheaper you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.790 
obviously the prices are way cheaper you

point<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.400> know<00:03:29.489> they'll<00:03:29.910> finally<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.420> there

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
point you know they'll finally get there

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.920 
point you know they'll finally get there
as<00:03:30.750> far<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.530> reliability<00:03:32.250> i<00:03:32.930> think

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
as far as that reliability i think

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.060 
as far as that reliability i think
you're<00:03:34.050> probably<00:03:34.080> going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.680> most

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
you're probably going to see most

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.040 
you're probably going to see most
businesses<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.330> particularly<00:03:36.810> large

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
businesses and particularly large

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.920 
businesses and particularly large
businesses<00:03:37.709> are<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.130> continue<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.670> use

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
businesses are going to continue to use

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
businesses are going to continue to use
traditional<00:03:39.930> providers<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:41.160> may<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.670> may

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
traditional providers they may it may

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.970 
traditional providers they may it may
wind<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.360> being<00:03:42.600> void<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.560> sense<00:03:43.770> that<00:03:43.830> it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
wind up being void in the sense that it

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.640 
wind up being void in the sense that it
may<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.670> carried<00:03:45.030> over<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.330> internet<00:03:45.660> but<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
may be carried over the internet but I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.140 
may be carried over the internet but I
think<00:03:46.890> you'll<00:03:46.980> probably<00:03:47.190> see<00:03:47.459> them<00:03:47.640> continue

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
think you'll probably see them continue

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.199 
think you'll probably see them continue
to<00:03:48.269> use<00:03:48.420> sort<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.780> big<00:03:49.130> providers<00:03:50.130> but<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:51.180> I

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
to use sort of big providers but but I

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.540 
to use sort of big providers but but I
think<00:03:51.480> even<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.050> small<00:03:52.320> businesses<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.100> know<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
think even for small businesses I know a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.090 
think even for small businesses I know a
feature<00:03:54.239> i<00:03:54.390> did<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.720> VoIP<00:03:55.320> i<00:03:55.530> talked<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> guy

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.000 
feature i did on VoIP i talked to a guy
who<00:03:56.160> ran<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.489> small<00:03:56.670> company<00:03:57.440> he<00:03:58.440> used<00:03:58.590> vontage

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
who ran a small company he used vontage

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.610 
who ran a small company he used vontage
because<00:03:59.459> he<00:04:00.269> could<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.050> same<00:04:01.320> phone

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
because he could have the same phone

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.590 
because he could have the same phone
number<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:02.160> 416<00:04:02.640> phone<00:04:03.000> number<00:04:03.300> no<00:04:03.450> matter

where he was so and there again it

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.670 
where he was so and there again it
changes<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> way<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.050> think<00:04:07.200> about<00:04:07.440> your
