00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
this stick this is a composite carbon as

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.550 
this stick this is a composite carbon as
well<00:01:06.190> as<00:01:06.280> fiberglass<00:01:06.729> materials<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:08.350> does

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
well as fiberglass materials it does

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.320 
well as fiberglass materials it does
have<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.799> taper<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.030> that's<00:01:10.150> going<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
have a taper to it so that's going to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.880 
have a taper to it so that's going to
offer<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.540> lower<00:01:10.720> cake<00:01:11.020> point<00:01:11.290> so<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:11.799> gonna

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
offer a lower cake point so it's gonna

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.350 
offer a lower cake point so it's gonna
have<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.070> quikr<00:01:12.340> shot<00:01:12.670> release<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.000> little<00:01:13.150> more

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
have a quikr shot release a little more

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.539 
have a quikr shot release a little more
of<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.510> responsive<00:01:14.140> feel<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.560> now<00:01:15.130> moving<00:01:15.400> on

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
of a responsive feel to it now moving on

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.130 
of a responsive feel to it now moving on
to<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.729> blade<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.360> has<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.570> very<00:01:16.869> similar

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
to the blade it has a very similar

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.870 
to the blade it has a very similar
design<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.680> what<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.010> saw<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> 4k<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:18.729> it

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
design to what you saw in the 4k but it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.580 
design to what you saw in the 4k but it
actually<00:01:19.000> does<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.689> different<00:01:20.350> corn

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
actually does have a different corn

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.429 
actually does have a different corn
there<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> graphite<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:22.450> fiberglass

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
there this is a graphite and fiberglass

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.719 
there this is a graphite and fiberglass
construction<00:01:23.680> between<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> two<00:01:24.610> materials

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
construction between the two materials

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.940

durability<00:01:34.450> but<00:01:34.990> it's<00:01:35.140> not<00:01:35.259> going<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.439> be

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
durability but it's not going to be

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.990 
durability but it's not going to be
quite<00:01:35.740> as<00:01:35.890> heavy<00:01:36.070> maybe<00:01:36.369> not<00:01:36.549> quite<00:01:36.939> as

specific<00:01:41.110> or<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.259> specific<00:01:41.920> stick<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.400> then

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
specific or I specific stick and then

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.700 
specific or I specific stick and then
going<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.689> overall<00:01:43.960> feel<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.470> guy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
going on to the overall feel of this guy

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.530 
going on to the overall feel of this guy
it<00:01:45.369> has<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.579> little<00:01:45.759> bit<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:45.939> a<00:01:46.030> lighter<00:01:46.270> feel

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
it has a little bit of a lighter feel

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.880 
it has a little bit of a lighter feel
because<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:46.990> graphite<00:01:47.470> in<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.710> blade

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
because of that graphite in the blade

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.039 
because of that graphite in the blade
instead<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.520> fiberglass<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.810> just

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
instead of the fiberglass but it is just

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.450 
instead of the fiberglass but it is just
a<00:01:50.140> little<00:01:50.350> bit<00:01:50.530> blade<00:01:50.770> heavy<00:01:51.009> which<00:01:51.280> you'd

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
a little bit blade heavy which you'd

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.249 
a little bit blade heavy which you'd
expect<00:01:51.549> from<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.210> level<00:01:52.390> price<00:01:52.689> point<00:01:52.990> stick

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
expect from this level price point stick

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
but really all in all it's a nice solid
