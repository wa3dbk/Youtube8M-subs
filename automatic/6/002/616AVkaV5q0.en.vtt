00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello I will show you how 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.670
 to make merengues 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 you know the little meringues where the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.299
 big hands that are touched by 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.800
 little favorite sites ones that are a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.630
 little fat when you can melt at 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 middle ben that's the one you're talking about 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 immediately to make these morin and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.250
 we need singles in two and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.920
 three hundred per caster sugar 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 we start by putting the whites in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.410
 the bowl with the whip and add to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 start a little bit of sugar 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.920
 semolina 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.340
 it will avoid the gray-white nose then 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340
 in Europe 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.310
 at a speed enough but we will wait 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.080
 that whites 2 be to climb to the three 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.030
 quarters and then we'll add the sugar 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.559
 semolina little by little our plans will be 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.820
 three quarter world and we can more 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.820
 or football 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.710
 this return does not hesitate to leave 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.179
 blend and mount the whites at each 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.719
 once we put a little bit 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:24.950
 over there we see meringue and more 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.179
 in addition firm we come to the end it does not 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.360
 left it like that 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.539
 incorporated and then me not alone will be 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.740
 almost completed for what has been 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.060
 added 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.369
 we still leave all and for one 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.039
 minute our meringue finished we have a 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.500
 meringue that is well closes well towards 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.939
 benevolent 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.250
 now this meringue we're going to 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.950
 get in shape before cooking for that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.799
 you have two solutions either you 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.619
 spoon directly 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.250
 on a sheet of parchment paper either 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.340
 like me you use a pocket with 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.969
 a burqa is not big enough and we're going 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.349
 to make people filled his pocket 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.349
 and we will make dancers 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 like this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.090
 no more and are ready to be cooked 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.220
 the particularity of meringues is 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.709
 that they are eight at low temperature 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.380
 that is 90 degrees but during 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.780
 long cooking takes about three 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.920
 hours before cooking, sprinkle 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.620
 meringue of icing sugar 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.410
 why is it going to allow a dress of 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 to stay shiny so we have shapes 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.970
 our meringue in a 90 Â° oven 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.209
 preheated and allowed to cook for 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.810
 about three hours after three hours 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.819
 Cooking 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.280
 words have meaning and then we can 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.500
 now remove them from the oven 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.330
 not only is it easy to do 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.489
 well you are in addition it keeps very 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.920
 long time for now no longer 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.840
 reason to hesitate 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 I hope this recipe has more for 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.030
