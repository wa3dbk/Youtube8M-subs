so our awesome fight it's a female
diamond<00:02:58.120> r870<00:02:59.120> seven<00:02:59.750> centimeters<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.340> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
diamond r870 seven centimeters so I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.050 
diamond r870 seven centimeters so I
guess<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.880> 55<00:03:02.420> kilos<00:03:02.800> give<00:03:03.800> us<00:03:03.970> that's<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
guess that 55 kilos give us that's a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.790 
guess that 55 kilos give us that's a
nice<00:03:05.210> basement

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
nice basement

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.560 
nice basement
normally<00:03:06.800> when<00:03:06.920> we're<00:03:07.040> measured<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:08.540> put

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
normally when we're measured in we put

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.110 
normally when we're measured in we put
the<00:03:08.780> two<00:03:09.530> sticks<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> ground<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.580> measure

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the two sticks to the ground and measure

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.520 
the two sticks to the ground and measure
the<00:03:11.330> straight<00:03:11.540> line<00:03:11.720> but<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.020> will<00:03:12.140> be<00:03:12.230> thirty

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the straight line but we will be thirty

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.920 
the straight line but we will be thirty
specula<00:03:13.010> quickly<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.240> is<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.480> guesstimate

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
specula quickly so this is a guesstimate

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.170 
specula quickly so this is a guesstimate
