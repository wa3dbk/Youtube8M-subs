Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call I'm angry
Call I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing
In the car, do you remember
Butterfly, Early Summer
It's playing on repeat, Just like when we would meet
Like when we would meet

00:00:46.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine
Stay with me tonight

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:43.900
dah
Stripped and pollished, I am new, I am fresh
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
Cause every breath that you will take
When you are sitting next to me
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, What's your fantasy?
(What's your, what's your...)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:08.700
Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine
Stay with me tonight

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I'm tired of being all alone, and this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
[X4]

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:45.200
Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to, 
Cause I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
to make you mine
