to review the lifeproof lifeproof case I
guess<00:00:21.330> what<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.020> called<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.350> made<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.650> the

seven reasons to choose the lifeproof

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.439

waterproof shockproof it's super thin it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
waterproof shockproof it's super thin it
can<00:00:57.090> fit<00:00:57.390> almost<00:00:57.690> anywhere<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.800> has<00:00:59.010> nice

i<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.430> demonstrate<00:01:59.810> up<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.990> coming<00:02:01.200> but

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
i will demonstrate up and coming but

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
i will demonstrate up and coming but
here<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> back<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> case<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
here is the back of the case so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
case is fully put on correctly or it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.490

won't<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.760> under<00:02:12.120> warranty

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
won't be under warranty

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
won't be under warranty
basically<00:02:13.800> they're<00:02:13.920> tell<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.430> test<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
basically they're tell you to test the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.770 
basically they're tell you to test the
case<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:16.500> water<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.970> basically<00:02:18.480> just

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
case for water like to basically just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.820 
case for water like to basically just
emerged<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.500> case<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.760> an<00:02:20.880> hour<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.540> water<00:02:22.020> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
emerged the case for an hour in water to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.150 
emerged the case for an hour in water to
make<00:02:22.950> sure<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.340> tight<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.960> won't<00:02:25.530> leak

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
make sure that it's tight and won't leak

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.820 
make sure that it's tight and won't leak
which<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.850> very<00:02:27.180> bad<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.560> iPhone

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
which is very bad if you have an iPhone

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.470 
which is very bad if you have an iPhone
in<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.610> there's<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.820> little<00:02:30.060> plug<00:02:30.270> there

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
in there so there's a little plug there

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.949 
in there so there's a little plug there
that's<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> headphone<00:02:31.890> jack<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.959> we're

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
that's for the headphone jack and we're

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.870 
that's for the headphone jack and we're
going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.110> screw<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.370> it's

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
going to screw it in there and it's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420 
going to screw it in there and it's
cruising<00:02:36.209> very<00:02:36.390> simple<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.890> stays<00:02:38.160> very

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
cruising very simple and it stays very

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.480 
cruising very simple and it stays very
secure<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> gasket<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.350> saw<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
secure it has a gasket as you saw so it

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.900 
secure it has a gasket as you saw so it
gets<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.180> waterproof<00:02:43.310> seal<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.550> there<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
gets that waterproof seal out there so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.380 
gets that waterproof seal out there so
you<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.120> listen<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:46.250> iPhone<00:02:47.250> music<00:02:48.180> in

you can listen to your iPhone music in
the<00:02:48.750> pouring<00:02:49.080> rain<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.739> do<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.160> sort<00:02:50.370> of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.840 
the pouring rain if you do that sort of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
iphone into the case here just slides

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.800 
iphone into the case here just slides
right<00:05:16.349> in<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:19.289> has<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.500> simple<00:05:19.830> slide<00:05:20.810> into

right in and it has a simple slide into
it<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.860> may<00:05:22.979> take<00:05:23.219> a<00:05:23.250> little<00:05:23.430> bit<00:05:23.520> of

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
it and it may take a little bit of

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.300 
it and it may take a little bit of
wiggling<00:05:23.879> in<00:05:24.840> there<00:05:25.139> just<00:05:25.440> because<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.099> has<00:05:26.280> a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
wiggling in there just because it has a

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.809 
wiggling in there just because it has a
nice<00:05:26.610> tight<00:05:27.150> seal<00:05:27.680> in<00:05:28.680> there<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.219> it<00:05:29.250> fits<00:05:29.699> very

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
nice tight seal in there so it fits very

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.800 
nice tight seal in there so it fits very
snug<00:05:30.539> but<00:05:31.529> it<00:05:32.069> fits<00:05:32.699> intuitively<00:05:33.300> in<00:05:33.599> there

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
snug but it fits intuitively in there

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.990 
snug but it fits intuitively in there
and<00:05:34.020> you're<00:05:34.229> able<00:05:34.349> to<00:05:34.560> snap<00:05:35.219> it<00:05:35.550> right<00:05:35.580> back<00:05:35.940> on

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
and you're able to snap it right back on

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.700 
and you're able to snap it right back on
you<00:05:36.270> want<00:05:36.449> to<00:05:36.509> make<00:05:36.630> sure<00:05:36.659> that<00:05:37.409> you<00:05:37.500> go<00:05:37.620> around

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
you want to make sure that you go around

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.279 
you want to make sure that you go around
all<00:05:38.069> the<00:05:38.430> edges<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:38.849> snap<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.659> in<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.169> make

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
all the edges and snap it in to make

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.279 
all the edges and snap it in to make
sure<00:05:40.319> that<00:05:40.740> it's<00:05:40.969> fully<00:05:41.969> sealed<00:05:42.719> so<00:05:43.050> there's

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
sure that it's fully sealed so there's

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.730 
sure that it's fully sealed so there's
no<00:05:43.440> big<00:05:43.800> gaps<00:05:44.310> anywhere<00:05:44.909> that<00:05:45.659> it's<00:05:45.840> as<00:05:46.319> close

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
no big gaps anywhere that it's as close

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.120 
no big gaps anywhere that it's as close
as<00:05:47.039> gap<00:05:47.669> doesn't<00:05:47.880> get<00:05:48.440> those<00:05:49.440> edges<00:05:50.009> are

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
as gap doesn't get those edges are

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.409 
as gap doesn't get those edges are
probably<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:52.190> culprits<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.370> most<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.240> your

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
probably the culprits of most of your

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.719 
probably the culprits of most of your
snapping<00:05:54.990> in<00:05:55.139> problems<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:56.460> just<00:05:56.580> make<00:05:56.699> sure

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
snapping in problems but just make sure

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:57.950 
snapping in problems but just make sure
you<00:05:56.849> get<00:05:56.909> those<00:05:57.060> edges<00:05:57.419> down<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.779> everything

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
you get those edges down and everything

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.200 
you get those edges down and everything
else<00:05:58.259> should<00:05:58.590> go<00:05:59.039> with<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.610> you<00:05:59.729> see<00:05:59.879> there<00:06:00.029> has

a<00:06:00.240> glossy<00:06:00.479> screen<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.139> got<00:06:01.349> my

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
a glossy screen and I got my

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.709 
a glossy screen and I got my
fingerprints<00:06:01.889> all<00:06:02.819> over<00:06:02.879> that<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.360> like<00:06:03.599> the

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
fingerprints all over that I like the

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.689 
fingerprints all over that I like the
more<00:06:03.870> matte<00:06:04.050> screens<00:06:04.500> but<00:06:04.800> glossy<00:06:05.370> screen

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
more matte screens but glossy screen

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.490 
more matte screens but glossy screen
