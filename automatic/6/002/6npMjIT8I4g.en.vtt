00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.919
 the youthful heroes of the eighties can see in a ribeiro of 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.310
 his second cartoon arcade game without a shawl this time ubisoft has 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.129
 done in limits with updated graphics and a facelift that has not 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.839
 sitting too well those who enjoyed their first version and 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.879
 They sought to revive their experiences with this new adaptation accompanying the 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.990
 famous quartet and already in time to beat the networks 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.770
 we start with the kinematics 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.930
 where we are as they want 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 kidnapped the New York statue of liberty after this rafael leonardo 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400
 marcelo's subsidiary 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.940
 they will embark on their rescue being transported to other times until 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.700
 conclude in the future where we will end all the generated chaos 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.289
 As for the game, we are facing a rival with very few improvements 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.270
 consistent 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740
 I saw no one side view where we'll have to do away with all the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.800
 enemies on the screen to advance and thus defeat the final boss of each level 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.080
 nine in total if they just arrive like this 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 one hour long 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.410
 throughout the episodes we can only sucre for the entity to perform 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.580
 special attacks and eliminate enemies whose artificial intelligence is almost 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.460
 null 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.100
 No kind of remarkable variation levels when choosing our 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 character we should compare by seeing their different qualities 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.640
 undoubtedly the best is complicated in online cooperative with up to four 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.370
 friends one of the few tricks of this adaptation the visual section is in what 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.410
 that the developer has worked harder not to say the only 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.650
 although its color palette on enemies and elements can even reach 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 purchase 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.040
 if he left with several colleagues still has good lighting 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.780
 patterned hard pickets 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.480
 in the sound we find very little novelty 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.350
 having a too repetitive musical thread 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 that much more could have been done in addition to the fact that the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 original melodies the sounds and effects at the time of the fight are 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.780
 corrected separately in the game has not added any extra cost cc and that of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.539
 the virgin at 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.189
 how the super nintendo versions were included 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.489
 except for the survival mode, in short, they are swollen 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.129
 is a game in which you could have influenced many more improvements 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.110
 has unnecessarily renewed a title 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.929
 that he had already fulfilled in his day 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:37.119
 if someone felt nostalgic has the first installment of 1989 in 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.809
 the arcade bazaar at half price
