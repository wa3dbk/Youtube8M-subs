00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.110
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.880
 hurt it's time for a good fight on t92 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.369
 and here is just the way one of mine 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.170
 Subscribers sent to my heading 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.900
 subscribers bend by the way this 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 already the third release this fight fight 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 It turned out in my opinion very interesting 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.949
 Well, not so much it is straight so interesting 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.960
 how much he is entertaining wondering is when 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.360
 I love some tactical moments 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 here exactly entertainment is present 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.190
 it will probably be the most correct 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 the definition of this fight and so on t92 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.460
 Comrade us in platoon and his co-worker 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.210
 on t49 gives the correct light on this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.340
 map we have charged on the head 140 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.200
 rolls well and need a good cure 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.059
 because on a piece of paper as you understand 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.370
 can not be thrown and put next 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:04.729
 need to hit the mark and so 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.009
 we aim him trajectory wait and here 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.850
 he stops aiming wants 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.550
 to shoot 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.250
 and see how well you shot co 140 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.869
 I am sure that he has an object on his chair 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.350
 start to burn just for this 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.900
 breaking through 1800 is in general something standard 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.820
 breaking through for grandma from 92 140 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.409
 starts to dump but not generally 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 I think that he will succeed 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.409
 too far well and to blame in general 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.130
 then so the recharge goes on which 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.900
 Lasts 45 seconds until rounded here 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.700
 our hero is in no hurry to translate 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.579
 Ukraine well and actually doing the right 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.540
 there safe and vrazhin anyway go 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.659
 to the left on the map 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.880
 well, and then nothing is translated practically 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.009
 already loaded buggy replays you see 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 the circle is a little wrong 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.220
 information but the green line it shows 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.149
 correct projectile flight path and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.899
 absolutely this is the correct trajectory 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.140
 she goes round to the royal tiger 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.000
 already watching this fight from the side 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.280
 viewers 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 batchat you see ally here flies somewhere 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.450
 drove in 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 you know such wonderful battats 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.330
 Here it is specifically in this 46 percent of victories 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 but I felt like a firefly I decided 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.480
 but now I will drag 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.530
 well, and why it did not work is unclear 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.730
 why he gave light on the cake and our 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.270
 the hero unfortunately was 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.300
 EVA and does not manage it and shoot well, 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.590
 the light of the fact that there is no one else to give 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.530
 so our hero of this account should 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.660
 understand slowly is translated here from 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.580
 3 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.310
 meanwhile he is full and here already to look 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.770
 its half it was a 268 object i 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.390
 sure and throw it already a piece of paper but 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.780
 somehow not comme il faut 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.060
 so we transfer to flow and wait for now 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.780
 he will come out too he decided to shoot 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.360
 so contented hang on hold 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.030
 this is an excellent resting three shots and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.140
 almost 5 thousand damage for these 3 photos 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.209
 Well, agree 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.970
 well, at least spectacular in general 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.220
 I picked the right words have not been 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 Vidos and even when riding with 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.170
 their sovzvodnye permanent dilute 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.090
 including ask micha where the video but 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.340
 just every day I go and watch 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.019
 nothing is doing something whole 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.170
 in days, well, in general, I already became 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:30.430
 I am ashamed to think my husband should do something 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.519
 so 113 90 begins to nightmare arthur 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.980
 4043 more by the way 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.840
 92 position is absolutely standard 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.930
 Incidentally, I absolutely immediately ride 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.329
 I 'll tell you a little secret in general 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.920
 there is nothing secret in this position . 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.930
 I did not particularly twitch 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.030
 so there is an assumption that he and 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.000
 further there will be well, respectively 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.400
 our hero comes down very much he wants him 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.829
 give lips are almost over it's time 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.690
 leave 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.200
 high explosive splash wonderful 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.900
 Huge send look well and to 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 Unfortunately, it is not reached. 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.710
 Well, in general, it is not only on t92 art 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.750
 general thing unpredictable 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.910
 there plan vbr nightmare just awful and so 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.480
 here we have three tanks apart from ours 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.580
 sovzvodnogo our hero try 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.940
 crush though no i was short not even 3 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.310
 there are four tanks up to 4 points trying 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.470
 crush t30 already cheap in general 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.080
 so figured I think our friend and 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 because they have to cope without looking 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.690
 the fact that there it sovzvodny he decided 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.030
 still support the guys below that is 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.420
 that's where katy t57 heavy seems to be rolling 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.090
 and must devote the cake and jagdpanteru 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.030
 supposedly one and a half business of course he is to him 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.870
 I want to take the cake 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.000
 high-explosive is also wonderful 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.550
 done and we will see what will happen 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.670
 get so far that it sovzvodny already 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.070
 resting t-62 there distributes all hijacker 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.720
 Nahalyavka and here's a look like 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.440
 Wonderfully well, just perfect 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.730
 turned up 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:11.750
 and the husband of the jacket himself became hold 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.930
 full damage and the cake is already resting candles 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.920
 he put everything great 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.720
 naturally only 60 left 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.840
 deuce she there even before parses 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.660
 the remaining allied tanks would sit down 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.160
 look straight drags horror straight what well 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.170
 apparently there were all cheap and with 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.960
 such a wonderful cannon. 2 in general 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.690
 no problem would pick including 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.320
 and these third forests in general it is even 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.370
 funny little so here we are reduced 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.660
 You see that little concerns to 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.120
 the trajectory seems to show that 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.880
 I must get you I assure you if he 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.500
 quit he would n't have gotten right here 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.300
 there were still some chances 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.080
 would you be here so calmly 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.290
 principle 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.940
 62 estimate but was not ready and 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.100
 accordingly decided not to throw correctly 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.070
 did totally disagree with 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.010
 the actions of our hero well and remains 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.050
 now only while nightmares arthur 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.750
 enemy, respectively, from 2 will go 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.900
 leave on the light of artillery of course 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.940
 he is not going to save 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.910
 Well, in general, then perhaps somewhere here he is 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.250
 must appear to leave by type 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.889
 system heavy point 200 garden eighth 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.340
 Allied until our hero checks what to 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.520
 what is there like everything should turn out 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.690
 Video 102 is already so sleep and we see it 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.289
 62 sends on the move and very lucky and I 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.479
 I'll tell you very nice just 62 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:47.009
 moved so discretely yes that is 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:51.250
 a little intermittently got to guess and 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.650
 wonderful damage numbers 8 249 hidden 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.169
 in my opinion there is absolutely no 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.090
 nakida papers handsome and in general 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.220
 here is such a wonderful fight 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.080
 I think everyone liked you too but 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.510
 naturally we write our money in 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.699
 comments do not forget what you need to 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.630
 participate in this conditional competition 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:12.460
 send my replay to me on to the group 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.590
 VKontakte yes there is a special topic 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.410
 leaving well and accordingly if you 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.349
 there will be for example such a fight I of course 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.190
 I’m happy to post it before 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:23.190
 new meetings all bye
