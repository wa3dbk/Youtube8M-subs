00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello everyone i'll come back to you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.250
 with a new video that concerns my 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.200
 tennman project so for all those 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 who do not know this project actually 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.490
 it's about selecting ten products 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.620
 that we must finish so I have 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.460
 chose some little care and some 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.330
 make up products 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 I tell you about sugar we start 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 immediately with a baby cream that I have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.289
 for almost a year now and that's 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 for that it is absolutely necessary already 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.160
 finish before aspirin 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.469
 so if you had me but dig from home 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.910
 yves rock I did you a review 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.530
 a few months ago 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.629
 it's a product that I really like 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 that there is a really high coverage 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.930
 light but unifying complexion and it's 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 what I like 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 she has perfume profession just sublime 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 and it's a real pleasure to use it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.809
 there is not much left of it at the 30 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.809
 June by the indebtedness 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 I also face from make up 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.490
 for ever that I must absolutely finish 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.330
 it's really quite a monk that the 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.090
 site is open 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.220
 So I decided to combine the two 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 of what I did today and I 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.700
 have to tell you I'm rather pleased 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 result he gives I think it has 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 it's much more beautiful 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.729
 very natural and really i do not feel 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 not on my skin and I really like are 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.740
 so I do not think he 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.990
 not much I would say little 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 near by russia 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.549
 there it will be annexed a combo and that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.549
 will determine at the latest 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.260
 we continue this time with an anti 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.030
 dark circles games books reviews on the 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
 blog I put you the link at half mast 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.360
 aphone do not hesitate and I made a 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.060
 little look so it's an anti 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.220
 search and cover girl and olÃ© le simply 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.250
 red bull s it looks like these 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.020
 of water that life will not crack at the level 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 of the hue I find that much too much 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.060
 clear to me yet I am very 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.620
 white skin and the little snag I 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.160
 coughs and does not hide enough 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.630
 dark circles 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.430
 but hey I have to do it because 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.710
 that I bought and that I'm not going to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 leave hanging in my drawers here 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.390
 easily that allows him 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.959
 always in the dark circles this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 this time women of china fourth 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.390
 this is the light rhdp that better like 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.930
 if their you know this is the one I have 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 bought in Geneva in the form of a small 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.140
 brush like that we will turn in good 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.410
 so this one to a really order 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.180
 light so as the anti dark circles 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.430
 floor and does not work well 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.410
 I use them in first approach while 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.720
 baby creams and after I'm used 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.209
 with cream and another a weaver by 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.310
 on because I do not find myself 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.560
 other utilities game tourtoulou who 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.650
 goes on there is perfection and as a 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.330
 light touch it's not really that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.660
 So that's the way I need them 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660
 uses 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.430
 then a carat pass that I wanted to re 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.810
 tested I had you guns and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 reviews some time ago this is the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.090
 steak if you can from yves rock that 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.709
 I loved it a long time and here I go 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.739
 so use it again I find 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.090
 that it is far too opaque and he 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.500
 is not as good as in me drunk 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 and it's true that he tends to do 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.370
 a little effect no spider so 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.190
 it's not what's better in terms of 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.019
 mascara and but hey I have to win 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.920
 still when I told him he is 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.920
 part of this small project 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.150
 so this time it's a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.719
 perfume of dechy eau de toilette 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.269
 playboy 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.579
 I could test -34 I love them there 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.769
 are really very very nice and 2 to 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.390
 disks or euros the authors are 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.719
 all more greedy than 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.220
 other 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.840
 and I really love that why I have to 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.189
 finish simply because I 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.140
 have others waiting 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.720
 and then I especially want to redeem myself at 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.860
 spring course of the book 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.290
 every day I do not get tired 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.150
 no and that's the story of being able 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.150
 use other runners afterwards 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.360
 this time we attack the products 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.730
 Or you go from a hair care 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.220
 so that's the style that therapy is there 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.370
 so the silky cure is an excellent 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.510
 product that I love to use that makes 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.960
 over a year and a half I believe that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.820
 I was going to stop I do not use because 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.770
 that I do not think it's true they 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.810
 leave the hair very talented at the level 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.720
 of the smell is something really 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.870
 the amazing game I love this smell 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.490
 she is one of my favorite authors 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.420
 and then here it is, it does not stay big 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.770
 similar thing happens in bottle and I 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.990
 think it goes fast so quickly 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.670
 I use almost every day one 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.720
 to search and 1000 capillary which 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.460
 you makes hair more 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.380
 brilliant comeback good etc 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.480
 it's really a product that I 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.740
 so recommend me I buy it at his place 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.740
 wholesaler I see there 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.560
 still in care but this time 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.880
 ci a face mask it's a 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.500
 yves rock mask 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.090
 before I was really masks 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.430
 yves rock but the series I want to 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.670
 novelty and this one of these places three 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.790
 minutes coolness mask for us is 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.440
 of lemon lying around in the cupboards 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.770
 and I have trouble using I find that 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.110
 after my scrub and cleansers he has 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.880
 started to arrive at this level and 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.620
 I did not use it too much but 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.990
 I have two months left of half 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.210
 we see there I will try to make 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.210
 better hoping this video motivates me 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.010
 then this time it's my 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.460
 cleaner duchy neutrogena I already have 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.410
 spoken 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.840
 I love this product is to mix a 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.030
 product that are super good it is 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.110
 really very soft for the skin 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.630
 I say that because I have everything 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.790
 just the chicken m it's true that the 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.800
 evening I wanted I do not stand too 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.450
 far from care is strongly that I 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.160
 remedy his death this one actually 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.430
 part and that we did not see big 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.430
 thing 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.270
 and still in the same range that 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.770
 besides I have the scrub that 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.270
 I also love and who is really 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.430
 very effective in reducing 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.139
 such imperfections it's just a 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.669
 story of laziness leaves a mix between 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.740
 other cities and besides I you 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.650
 recommend this range despite this sweater 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.120
 you do not lie 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.800
 I'm very sensitive yet 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.450
 what you're worth there absolutely does not 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.680
 of button now I think that's it 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.780
 depends on each person and it takes 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.730
 test to be able to have what it takes 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.310
 so predicts the same 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.140
 I have more thing left, so here we go 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.700
 I really hope this video you 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.810
 will have pleased you it changes a little bit of 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.400
 what can be found on the chain 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.810
 do not hesitate to tell me if you too 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.640
 you have some products that you 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.190
 must absolutely get rid of 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.210
 as I move we know the opportunity 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.070
 to sell a little while in stock 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.430
 because I want to start again on good 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.710
 bases 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.390
 So here I am, I tell you very quickly 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.570
