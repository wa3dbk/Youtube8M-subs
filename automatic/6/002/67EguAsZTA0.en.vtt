00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.539
 to heat properly with wood, of course, that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.850
 Let's rest both men together 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 ash is the best basis for the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.980
 perfect burn and for high 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.620
 temperatures in the firebox 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.519
 initially as much air supplied 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.489
 become 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.729
 this increases the combustion temperature 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.729
 fast 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.639
 when cheering it can be quiet two pieces 

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:52.409
 be more wood 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:55.319
 class for a country without much smoke 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.760
 are small firewood and in wax 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.760
 soaked wood shavings 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.629
 so everything burns clean 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.490
 at temperatures up to 100 degrees celsius 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.110
 Now the rest escapes from wood moisture 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.930
 when the temperature keeps rising 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 burn the gas in the first place 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.979
 are stored in the wood cells 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.170
 not the wood itself after 15 to 20 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.170
 minutes to adjust the air supply 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 burn the wood lane together with 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.259
 the right amount of oxygen is that 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.259
 fire perfect 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.940
 so the first edition is almost burned down 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:04.450
 now can be refilled on 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:07.710
 best with hardwood five minutes full 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.710
 Air supply range 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.510
 if it burns so well, it's good for us 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.530
 and our environment means little smoke 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.560
 little pollutants where i know that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.900
 from the spartherm operating instructions 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.640
 Everything here is what you are about 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 to know the right heating 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.390
 we do not need that anymore for today 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 reloading 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.910
