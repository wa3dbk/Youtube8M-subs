could muddy for any of the GTA as well

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.149 
could muddy for any of the GTA as well
but<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.109> can<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.679> known<00:01:31.829> legal<00:01:31.950> aid

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but you can see it's a known legal aid

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.529 
but you can see it's a known legal aid
for<00:01:32.189> cars<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:32.999> a<00:01:33.030> variety<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
for cars you can get a variety of

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.690 
for cars you can get a variety of
different<00:01:33.630> cause<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> GTA<00:01:35.429> 5

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
different cause the one from the GTA 5

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
different cause the one from the GTA 5
image<00:01:36.090> leaks<00:01:36.389> yellow<00:01:36.749> or<00:01:37.049> greenish<00:01:37.499> I'm<00:01:38.039> not

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
image leaks yellow or greenish I'm not

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.889 
image leaks yellow or greenish I'm not
100%<00:01:38.789> sure<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.389> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.719> it's

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
100% sure but as you can see it's

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.319 
100% sure but as you can see it's
definitely<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> bright<00:01:41.159> light<00:01:41.520> coming<00:01:42.119> from

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
definitely a bright light coming from

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
definitely a bright light coming from
underneath<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.289> car<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:44.009> tried<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.429> think

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
underneath that car I've tried to think

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 
underneath that car I've tried to think
what<00:01:44.700> else<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.210> could<00:01:45.389> possibly<00:01:45.539> be<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.200> don't

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
what else this could possibly be I don't

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.749 
what else this could possibly be I don't
think<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.889> could<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.219> headlights<00:01:47.579> because

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
think it could be the headlights because

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.279 
think it could be the headlights because
again<00:01:48.090> you'd<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.689> them<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.959> front<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
again you'd only see them in front this

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.929 
again you'd only see them in front this
is<00:01:49.439> coming<00:01:49.679> from<00:01:49.709> everywhere<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.700> color

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
is coming from everywhere and the color

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.300 
is coming from everywhere and the color
of<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:51.749> too<00:01:51.810> bright<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> also<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
of this is way too bright and also it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
of this is way too bright and also it
couldn't<00:01:53.639> be<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.729> street<00:01:54.179> lamp<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.689> them

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
couldn't be a street lamp because them

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.230 
couldn't be a street lamp because them
in<00:01:54.990> gta5<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:56.100> wise<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.639> they're

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
in gta5 are actually wise and they're

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.029 
in gta5 are actually wise and they're
actually<00:01:57.539> not<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.929> bright<00:01:58.200> especially<00:01:58.920> not

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
actually not this bright especially not

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.039 
actually not this bright especially not
this<00:01:59.189> core<00:01:59.429> so<00:01:59.639> I<00:01:59.819> definitely<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.899> know

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
this core so I definitely think we know

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
this core so I definitely think we know
that<00:02:01.200> GTA<00:02:01.530> 5<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.069> nitrogen<00:02:02.459> is<00:02:02.609> having

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that GTA 5 for the nitrogen is having

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
that GTA 5 for the nitrogen is having
new<00:02:03.060> features<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> definitely<00:02:04.590> one

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
new features and this is definitely one

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
new features and this is definitely one
of<00:02:04.799> them<00:02:05.039> only<00:02:05.310> glows<00:02:05.789> for<00:02:06.060> cause<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.509> think

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
of them only glows for cause I think

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.029 
of them only glows for cause I think
that'll<00:02:06.959> be<00:02:07.049> awesome<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.529> not<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.889> do<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
