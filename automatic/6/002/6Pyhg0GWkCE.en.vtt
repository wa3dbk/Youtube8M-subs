and even at ten we did it so now it's on

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.040 
and even at ten we did it so now it's on
to<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.430> rest<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.000> know<00:02:07.090> attack<00:02:07.480> against

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
to to rest and you know attack against

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.619 
to to rest and you know attack against
New<00:02:08.140> York<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.739> Wednesday<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.420> ten<00:02:10.420> it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
New York on on Wednesday in ten it's

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.360 
New York on on Wednesday in ten it's
always<00:02:10.899> difficult<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.500> sometimes<00:02:11.890> when<00:02:12.099> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
always difficult but sometimes when the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.430 
always difficult but sometimes when the
team<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.910> ten<00:02:13.150> they<00:02:13.450> they<00:02:13.840> still<00:02:14.050> play<00:02:14.260> well

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
team is in ten they they still play well

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.809 
team is in ten they they still play well
and<00:02:14.650> they<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.250> they<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.670> work

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and they know that they have to work

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.259 
and they know that they have to work
more<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.110> get<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> result<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:19.030> think

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
more to get a result and I think

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.050 
more to get a result and I think
sometimes<00:02:20.040> maybe<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> was<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.310> destiny<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
sometimes maybe it was just destiny and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.149 
sometimes maybe it was just destiny and
lucky<00:02:22.420> but<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.599> think<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.140> really<00:02:23.590> worked<00:02:24.010> hard

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
lucky but I think we really worked hard

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.580 
lucky but I think we really worked hard
and<00:02:24.489> yes<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.450> result<00:02:25.750> give<00:02:25.930> us<00:02:26.080> something

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
and yes the result give us something

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.979 
and yes the result give us something
important<00:02:27.190> back<00:02:27.370> yeah<00:02:28.239> well<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.690> know<00:02:28.750> that's

important back yeah well you know that's

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.030 
important back yeah well you know that's
what<00:02:29.170> that's<00:02:29.349> what<00:02:29.440> makes<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:29.800> game<00:02:29.980> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
what that's what makes this game so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.530 
what that's what makes this game so
great<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.670> know<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.120> games<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.510> that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
within your backs are against the wall

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.559 
within your backs are against the wall
and<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.190> fans<00:02:33.489> with<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.879> are<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.360> too

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.759 
through
and<00:02:36.879> I<00:02:37.269> think<00:02:37.810> tonight<00:02:38.140> was<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.409> perfect

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
and I think tonight was a perfect

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.679 
and I think tonight was a perfect
example<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.969> why<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.150> game<00:02:40.450> so

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
example of that and why this game so

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.929 
example of that and why this game so
great<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:42.579> there's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.790> lot<00:02:42.879> of

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
great and I think there's a lot of

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.580 
great and I think there's a lot of
smiling<00:02:43.209> faces<00:02:43.329> going<00:02:43.840> home<00:02:43.989> from<00:02:44.109> bc<00:02:44.379> place

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
smiling faces going home from bc place

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.809 
smiling faces going home from bc place
tonight<00:02:44.859> that's<00:02:45.069> what<00:02:45.189> it's<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:45.400> about<00:02:45.430> I

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
tonight that's what it's all about I

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.940 
tonight that's what it's all about I
didn't<00:02:46.480> really<00:02:46.569> look<00:02:46.750> at<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.959> clock<00:02:47.200> until<00:02:47.469> we

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
didn't really look at the clock until we

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.470 
didn't really look at the clock until we
score<00:02:48.010> which<00:02:48.519> was<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.849> 80th<00:02:49.150> because<00:02:49.359> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
score which was in the 80th because I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.110 
score which was in the 80th because I
you<00:02:49.750> know<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.109> kind<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.319> in<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:50.590> zone<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you know I was kind of in the zone and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.849 
you know I was kind of in the zone and
but<00:02:52.120> then<00:02:52.239> once<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.930> saw<00:02:53.290> we're<00:02:53.560> ten

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
but then once you know you saw we're ten

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.229 
but then once you know you saw we're ten
minutes<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.489> were<00:02:54.579> like<00:02:54.730> okay<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
minutes in you were like okay we have a

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.539 
minutes in you were like okay we have a
chance<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.920> know<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.129> dodged<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.519> few

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
chance and you know we dodged a few

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.059 
chance and you know we dodged a few
bullets<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.599> think<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.379> worked<00:02:59.890> hard

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
bullets but I think we worked hard

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.580 
bullets but I think we worked hard
enough<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.430> create<00:03:00.579> those<00:03:00.760> breaks<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.590> you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
enough to create those breaks and you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.960 
enough to create those breaks and you
know<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.950> me<00:03:03.069> personally<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.549> was<00:03:03.609> just<00:03:03.819> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
know for me personally it was just a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.990 
know for me personally it was just a
great<00:03:04.480> night<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:04.689> think<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.290> guys<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:06.189> can't<00:03:06.849> say

great night I think the guys I can't say

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
great night I think the guys I can't say
enough<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.510> when<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.780> team<00:03:07.989> works<00:03:08.189> hard<00:03:09.189> for

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430
