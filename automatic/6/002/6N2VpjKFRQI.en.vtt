water and the killer fish have greatly

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450 
water and the killer fish have greatly
improved<00:00:06.569> their<00:00:06.720> size<00:00:06.930> from<00:00:07.799> being<00:00:08.069> half<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
improved their size from being half the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.150 
improved their size from being half the
size<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.820> white<00:00:09.000> cloud<00:00:09.179> fry<00:00:09.769> like<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> newly

size of a white cloud fry like a newly

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.789 
size of a white cloud fry like a newly
hatched<00:00:11.280> one<00:00:11.700> which<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.809> small<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
hatched one which is really small to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.200 
hatched one which is really small to
about<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.969> five<00:00:15.690> day<00:00:16.170> old<00:00:16.199> guppy<00:00:17.039> which<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
about a five day old guppy which is a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.990 
about a five day old guppy which is a
lot<00:00:18.390> better<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.960> they're<00:00:19.439> accepting<00:00:20.039> more<00:00:20.250> on

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
lot better and they're accepting more on

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
lot better and they're accepting more on
hold<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.630> could<00:00:21.810> accept<00:00:22.080> more<00:00:22.350> food<00:00:22.590> now

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
hold they could accept more food now

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.029 
hold they could accept more food now
because<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> larger<00:00:23.640> mouth

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
because they have a larger mouth

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.290 
because they have a larger mouth
the<00:00:26.039> reason<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> light<00:00:26.730> right<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the reason I have a light right now on I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.870 
the reason I have a light right now on I
don't<00:00:27.510> keep<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.500> constant<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.699> just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
don't keep this on constant and just

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
don't keep this on constant and just
keep<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.960> 30<00:00:31.199> minutes<00:00:31.529> while

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
keep it for about like 30 minutes while

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.450 
keep it for about like 30 minutes while
they're<00:00:32.520> eating<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:34.070> they<00:00:35.070> could<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.309> their

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they're eating so they could see their

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180 
they're eating so they could see their
food<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.120> feed<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:37.410> three<00:00:37.680> four<00:00:37.920> times

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
food I feed them about three four times

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.720 
food I feed them about three four times
a<00:00:38.340> day

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a day

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.240 
a day
so<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.950> grow<00:00:40.950> faster<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.920> they're<00:00:43.920> really

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so they grow faster and they're really

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.720 
so they grow faster and they're really
hungry<00:00:44.399> fish<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.629> um<00:00:45.899> I've<00:00:46.890> been<00:00:46.980> basing<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
hungry fish and um I've been basing the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
hungry fish and um I've been basing the
amount<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.149> feed<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:49.160> under<00:00:50.160> their

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
amount to feed them as under their

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.610 
amount to feed them as under their
stomach<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.750> fold<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.350> all

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stomach up when they fold they're all

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.819 
stomach up when they fold they're all
they<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> Canora<00:00:53.430> stronger<00:00:53.910> stomach<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
they have a Canora stronger stomach and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.099 
they have a Canora stronger stomach and
if<00:00:55.829> they're<00:00:56.100> hungry<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> clear

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
if they're hungry they have a clear

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.250 
if they're hungry they have a clear
stomach<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> start

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
stomach so so you know when to start

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
stomach so so you know when to start
feeding<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.180> important

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
feeding them and it's really important

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.140
