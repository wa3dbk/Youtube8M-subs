you play before it's almost impossible

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.390 
you play before it's almost impossible
you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> aim<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:19.530> sights<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.280> your

analog sticks is to go up and right and
go<00:01:26.729> left<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.540> almost<00:01:28.200> impossible

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
go left right it's almost impossible

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.990 
go left right it's almost impossible
because<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.009> can't<00:01:29.250> move<00:01:29.430> while<00:01:29.790> you're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
because you can't move while you're

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
because you can't move while you're
aiming<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.360> sights<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
aiming down sights so you do do that up

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530 
aiming down sights so you do do that up
and<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.030> feel<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and down because you feel like you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
and down because you feel like you
should<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.780> running<00:01:34.049> forward<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:34.770> not

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
should be running forward but you're not

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
should be running forward but you're not
and<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.909> almost<00:01:36.030> impossible<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> got

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to shoot with X so I don't know it's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270 
to shoot with X so I don't know it's
almost<00:01:39.659> impossible<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.229> shoot<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> game

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
almost impossible to shoot on this game

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
almost impossible to shoot on this game
if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> ever<00:01:42.180> played<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> before<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.840> almost

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
if you ever played it before it's almost

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.039 
if you ever played it before it's almost
impossible<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.299> game<00:01:45.570> it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
time but it's so crazy how the game has

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
time but it's so crazy how the game has
evolved<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:26.070> from<00:04:26.250> seeing<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.610> from<00:04:26.699> then

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
evolved just from seeing it from then

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.310 
evolved just from seeing it from then
because<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.330> was<00:04:27.449> my<00:04:27.509> favorite<00:04:27.990> game<00:04:28.110> when

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
Rising 1 kind of sucked I felt like I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.170 
Rising 1 kind of sucked I felt like I
was<00:05:20.400> more<00:05:20.610> pressured<00:05:21.419> into<00:05:21.750> actually<00:05:23.180> beating

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
was more pressured into actually beating

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.300 
was more pressured into actually beating
the<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:25.110> campaign<00:05:25.620> behind<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.190> or

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
single-player campaign and on this one I

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.899 
single-player campaign and on this one I
don't<00:05:28.710> really<00:05:28.830> feel<00:05:28.979> pressured<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.430> do<00:05:29.639> it<00:05:29.760> it

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
don't really feel pressured to do it it

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.000 
don't really feel pressured to do it it
feels<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.210> little<00:05:30.330> bit<00:05:30.479> longer<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.650> first<00:05:31.860> time

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
feels a little bit longer the first time

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.649 
feels a little bit longer the first time
I<00:05:32.039> was<00:05:32.220> playing<00:05:32.340> Dead<00:05:32.669> Rising<00:05:32.849> 1<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.360> didn't

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
I was playing Dead Rising 1 I didn't

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.779 
I was playing Dead Rising 1 I didn't
really<00:05:33.930> like<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.680> storyline<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.250> didn't<00:05:35.669> know

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
really like the storyline I didn't know

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.879 
really like the storyline I didn't know
what<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.090> do<00:05:36.300> on<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.960> one<00:05:37.169> it<00:05:37.349> seems<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.770> little

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
what to do on this one it seems a little

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.950 
what to do on this one it seems a little
bit<00:05:38.039> more<00:05:38.159> fluid<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.449> know<00:05:39.659> what<00:05:39.810> you're

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
bit more fluid you know what you're

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360 
bit more fluid you know what you're
supposed<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.289> do<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.889> can<00:05:41.010> do<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.220> whenever

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
supposed to do you can do it whenever

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.100 
supposed to do you can do it whenever
you<00:05:41.580> want<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:42.120> have<00:05:42.150> pretty<00:05:42.690> much<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:42.900> good

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
you want you have pretty much a good

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.390 
you want you have pretty much a good
amount<00:05:43.260> of<00:05:43.380> time<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.620> actually<00:05:43.949> finish<00:05:44.159> it

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
amount of time to actually finish it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.279 
amount of time to actually finish it
equal<00:05:44.940> i'll<00:05:45.030> doing<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:45.510> side<00:05:45.750> missions<00:05:46.110> and

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
equal i'll doing like side missions and

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.899 
equal i'll doing like side missions and
stuff<00:05:46.380> like<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.830> but<00:05:47.310> talking<00:05:47.550> about<00:05:47.669> like

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
stuff like that but talking about like

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.700 
stuff like that but talking about like
some<00:05:48.090> of<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.240> bosses<00:05:48.449> in<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.870> game<00:05:48.900> into<00:05:49.620> the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
some of the bosses in the game into the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.680 
some of the bosses in the game into the
rising<00:05:49.979> 3<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.370> seems<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.699> little<00:05:50.849> bit<00:05:51.090> easier<00:05:51.509> to

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
rising 3 it seems a little bit easier to

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.270 
rising 3 it seems a little bit easier to
take<00:05:52.169> out<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.409> pauses<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:52.889> might<00:05:53.009> be<00:05:53.130> just

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
take out the pauses it might be just

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.279 
take out the pauses it might be just
because<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.580> mechanics<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.659> game<00:05:54.690> and

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
because the mechanics of the game and

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.779 
because the mechanics of the game and
the<00:05:55.409> guns<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:55.979> everything<00:05:56.190> like<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.460> are<00:05:56.759> a

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
the guns and everything like that are a

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.570 
the guns and everything like that are a
lot<00:05:57.090> easier<00:05:57.509> to<00:05:57.630> do<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.440> can<00:05:58.560> like<00:05:58.740> dive<00:05:59.310> out

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
lot easier to do you can like dive out

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.310 
lot easier to do you can like dive out
of<00:05:59.669> people's<00:05:59.970> way<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.240> can<00:06:00.599> sprint<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.110> can

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
of people's way you can sprint you can

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.649 
of people's way you can sprint you can
jump<00:06:01.620> easier<00:06:02.130> in<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.120> first<00:06:03.300> one<00:06:03.509> you

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
jump easier in the first one you

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.540 
jump easier in the first one you
literally<00:06:04.020> couldn't<00:06:04.380> do<00:06:04.470> any<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:05.039> that<00:06:05.130> I

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
literally couldn't do any of that I

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.820 
literally couldn't do any of that I
think<00:06:06.030> you<00:06:06.090> could<00:06:06.270> dive<00:06:06.570> but<00:06:07.259> it<00:06:07.380> wasn't<00:06:07.710> as

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
think you could dive but it wasn't as

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.189 
think you could dive but it wasn't as
effective<00:06:08.190> as<00:06:08.639> in<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.060> game<00:06:09.300> he<00:06:09.870> couldn't

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
effective as in this game he couldn't

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.499 
effective as in this game he couldn't
sprint<00:06:10.560> in<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.830> other<00:06:10.949> one<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:12.030> was<00:06:12.150> just<00:06:12.360> it

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
sprint in the other one it was just it

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.770 
sprint in the other one it was just it
just<00:06:12.539> felt<00:06:12.960> like<00:06:13.110> an<00:06:14.090> unmade<00:06:15.090> finished<00:06:15.539> game<00:06:15.720> I

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
just felt like an unmade finished game I

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.330 
just felt like an unmade finished game I
guess<00:06:16.139> if<00:06:16.289> that's<00:06:16.409> you<00:06:16.650> would<00:06:16.800> say<00:06:16.979> for<00:06:17.280> the

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
guess if that's you would say for the

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.339 
guess if that's you would say for the
Dead<00:06:17.520> Rising<00:06:17.699> 1<00:06:18.090> it<00:06:18.419> was<00:06:18.539> a<00:06:18.570> lot<00:06:18.750> harder<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:19.199> do

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
Dead Rising 1 it was a lot harder to do

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.860 
Dead Rising 1 it was a lot harder to do
and<00:06:19.669> it<00:06:20.669> felt<00:06:20.940> like<00:06:21.060> you<00:06:21.180> were<00:06:21.270> more<00:06:21.389> pressured

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
and it felt like you were more pressured

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.439 
and it felt like you were more pressured
into<00:06:22.050> doing<00:06:22.199> or<00:06:22.650> beating<00:06:23.070> the<00:06:23.190> stuff<00:06:23.449> instead

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
into doing or beating the stuff instead

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.149 
into doing or beating the stuff instead
of<00:06:24.509> this<00:06:24.750> one<00:06:24.930> so<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.349> don't<00:06:25.560> know<00:06:25.620> hope<00:06:26.039> you

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
of this one so I don't know hope you

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.320 
of this one so I don't know hope you
