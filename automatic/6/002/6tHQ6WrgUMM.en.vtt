00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.550
 Did you get the bridge mute you did last time? 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.850
 It is only a six-string opening, but I think it was difficult to place the right hand for a while. 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.059
 So, let's use bridge mute with power cord this time. 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.839
 Let's play bridged mute with the chord G, A, C, D that you played last time. 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.749
 First of all, what does it mean? 

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:36.820
 In the feeling that, the sound which did not bridge mute and the sound which did bridge mute. 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
 The sound of "Jar" ​​and the sound of "Zun". 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.210
 I want to use these two sounds well to produce a crisp sound. 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.820
 First, let's practice a little with just the G code. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.170
 At the first shot, "Jar" ​​makes a sound not to mute the bridge. 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.780
 Then three more times. It is three times. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 Let's make a bridge muted sound, "Zun" sound. 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.430
 Just repeat it. 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.560
 It sounds like "Jar, Zun, Zun, Zun" or "Jar, Zun, Zun, Zun". 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.930
 If you play this all the time with rhythm 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.850
 It sounds like that. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 This seems easy if you look at it, but it is actually quite difficult when you try it. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.880
 Picking up with your right hand completely separated, "Jar" ​​sounds. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 And last time I found it properly 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.150
 Put your hand where it sounds like a pleasant "deep" and pick it. 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.790
 And once this is done let's change the code and move on. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.879
 And so on. 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.820
 This "Jar" ​​and "Zun". 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.019
 The key to how well the sound works is the key to whether the cool sound sounds or not. 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.200
 Let's separate and attach properly, and let's put out the sound that worked well.
