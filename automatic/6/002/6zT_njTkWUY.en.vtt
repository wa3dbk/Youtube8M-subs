00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.609
 check engine vibration with 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.609
 coins 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.410
 here's a coin 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.830
 sleep ruble 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.030
 new ones 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.900
 Yes 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.680
 with a ruble and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.680
 easier they could have more 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:54.140
 the engine started the engine is not warm and 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 as we see the door delivered 200 rubles 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.480
 coin floor 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.010
 Peter was to live in peace in my soul 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.010
 horizontal nobody set 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 it will not work again 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.329
 whether they are whether to choose whether to choose 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.550
 to rule 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 getting out 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.509
 the doctors put the bay can see the poet even 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.509
 i.e. slight vibration 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.070
 know and want to put coins 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.119
 beacon if the dart of vibration is small 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 So 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 we'll see 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.120
 on the face of the cabin 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 DNR does not put somehow permanently so 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.440
 hint and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.440
 and gender 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:54.080
 we have a little at once and do not argue that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:56.560
 and there are at least no coins now 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.560
 falls 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:13.990
 the machine has already warmed up the temperature 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.990
 problem rose again 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 Yes 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.640
 Yes 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.140
 have ours 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.140
 less basically there is a slight vibration 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.180
 up to which 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.800
 hopefully 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.030
 even so 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.030
 small overshoot has 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.230
 the final 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.230
 he i do n't need anything in principle 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.750
 just like that
