00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 As long as there is Mina San Kong Banha 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.750
 b group is with Japanese 3gs safari browser 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.289
 Okudera installed in 032 of 2 Mirko 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.449
 Mobile 9.7 beta version 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.480
 Yes I want to do a comparative test 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.480
 sebi was caught in planning 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.989
 acid 3 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 I would like to use this one 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.989
 I'll give you an evaluation of what was already started 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.930
 Street of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.480
 After all 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 Both are possible 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 Point out the item on this wonderful device 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 Good luck also this time 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.990
 In terms of processing speed 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.320
 I hope you can see and compare that time 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
 I think before 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 The best friends are used by Mom 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.560
 Honest 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 I'm getting a plaza 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.760
 Some of us are also relatively 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.290
 I think the speed is faster but still a little 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 Is processing speed of Willcom zero three? 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 It feels like it's getting slower with a little curve foot 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.470
 It feels like 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 As you see 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480
 If you are operamobile 9.5 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.660
 100 points are perfect 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.240
 Mano hey here- 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.450
 I know when you look in the morning but 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 A little excitement 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 Tell me outside the screen 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.430
 It's kind of like I was a bit blurry 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.390
 The display has broken a little 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.280
 Rice here- 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.659
 If you are operamobile, 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.659
 The competition is done 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.119
 I think that I was able to go down to that speed quite now 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.989
 This is 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.439
 It does not have to be portrait joint 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.379
 When it is in landscape mode, more size comes out 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.379
 So I think I've also seen a bit 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.019
 Following 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.019
 I want to do something like this 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.810
 I'm quite operamobile is in landscape mode 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.579
 Hey Osaka 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.309
 It will be late 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.909
 I think it will be heavy 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.759
 Than portrait mode 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.759
 I will see 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
 Something like this 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.840
 I think that it is the former old prosecutor in 7 points of Miyanaka 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.279
 If you are hit by that shock, you have a hit if you have ethnic mobile machines 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.389
 It can be installed 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.159
 Such as key kilo range 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.669
 While using fast cpu 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.499
 If it is a terminal 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.849
 I think you can expect the processing speed and performance 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:11.399
 Still
