00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone and gemma good they are 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.689
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.450
 animal 3 simile and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.610
 make a very easy coffin so stay 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.290
 attentive that we go there first we are going to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.290
 choose the colors 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 these green these 2 green this what 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.110
 we will put in black 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.310
 and we're going for some grays 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.310
 of this type 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.260
 this 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.820
 this 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.420
 and this you put them in black 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.420
 mariah is now going to start 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 filling 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.320
 all of this baby's green 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 we take the stick 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.890
 and with this from here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.890
 we make what would be the grass 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.750
 so that we do not get scared we make piquitos 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.210
 this is totally irregular 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.540
 without leaving trying not to leave many 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.270
 holes we pick up this and we give 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.570
 over where there is more green how are you 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 areas 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.500
 we take this now and we do the same 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.580
 and we have whatever the grass is now 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.570
 let's take the little circle 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.730
 we take this one here and with so good no 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 It is necessary to count but good for you 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.550
 make an idea it would be 6 here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.050
 dais 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 and that is the most of the most 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.930
 for example equal of both sides 2 and 2 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.420
 2 and 2 would be up and down and now 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.420
 we take this and down 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 we take this to paint with care in 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.400
 do not leave 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.239
 A) Yes 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.950
 and now let's do the cross we 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.140
 we approach and here we will make a cross or what 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.380
 that you want, I am going to make a 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.380
 cross 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.660
 and we already have the cross and now we're going to 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.660
 the darkest 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.170
 and we are going to do as the shadow of the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.170
 head 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890
 A) Yes 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.320
 to any perfect trait 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.500
 now let's take this and let's do 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.500
 the same 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 yes 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.970
 yes 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.349
 and so now let's take this and what 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.780
 same but more irregular without need 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.780
 to be there but the perfect 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.590
 yes 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.599
 so it's worth 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.599
 now it's the same 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.319
 and being nice around here 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.920
 and now making little pits like this now 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.920
 these colors 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.159
 let's do like this mother 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.140
 and so now with this which is the most 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.950
 color has let's make the light of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.950
 silver 2 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.160
 a little bit of light 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.770
 general now what are we going to write 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.500
 the letters in this gray 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.340
 we do not approach the central point and 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.340
 let's make a 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.309
 we already have the letters made have been 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.129
 easy now let's make the shadow of the 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:49.829
 coffin will take the lighter ones we 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.639
 let's zoom in and let's make a 

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:56.740
 perspective line like this 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.740
 irregularly shaped as it is grass 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.000
 yes 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.210
 and here we are going to do what would be the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.210
 cross 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.360
 let's put some light around 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.870
 because you do not see much and now with this 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.870
 darker 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.159
 it is this 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.159
 and s 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:41.250
 well and here like 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.250
 we want to make tiny lines 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.530
 and with this egg 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.740
 and we will add a little light green 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.830
 the presentation I will for another little bit of 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.830
 Dark 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.860
 and we already have a coffin guys see what 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.290
 easy in less than 10 minutes what 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.490
 we have finished and nothing guys I hope that
