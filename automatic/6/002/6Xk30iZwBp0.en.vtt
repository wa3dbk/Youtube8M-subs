00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.920
 such 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.470
 what we were looking could develop 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 suspicious objects 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:49.200
 the hexagon said yes activity all that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 is just at this match and sisters in so 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.510
 you think you can dance this guy to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.100
 testing that actually challenge the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 best way we found 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.070
 practice the game internally any case 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.300
 it was to make the tournament on the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.320
 competition internally so the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.790
 competition it is not necessarily 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.170
 something that we have design and we 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.550
 do not know to go we'll start on 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:36.119
 a competitive breeding ground the competition is 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:39.149
 born naturally in fact when we 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.819
 look at a fps in fact we see 90% 100% 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.890
 almost 100% of the action by extending 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.240
 the camera view of the player and we in our 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
 fashion spectators we did the opposite 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 I watch the entirety of the team I 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.459
 see all the movements to be done I 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 see all the preparatory work and 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.880
 after when I need I can go 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 directly see the individual action 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:35.070
 I wanted in any case to make sure 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.330
 that this game can involve 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.810
 the players because that's what makes 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.700
 the difference 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.320
 and when we see that we play and we 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.330
 get sucked up absorbed as we begin 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.780
 to see even bad behaviors 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.530
 players etc 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.770
 that means we're really 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770
 to play
