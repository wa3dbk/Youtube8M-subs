00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
are a lot of people who projected and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.729 
are a lot of people who projected and
predict<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> predicted<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.960> Daniel<00:00:34.440> Bryan

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
predict and predicted that Daniel Bryan

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.049

swerve<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.090> did<00:00:39.300> throw<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> serve

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
