let you guys know what we're seeing at
least<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> PTU<00:00:24.690> obviously<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> PTU

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
least in the PTU obviously it's the PTU

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.800 
least in the PTU obviously it's the PTU
this<00:00:26.490> isn't<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> final<00:00:27.000> product<00:00:27.360> so<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
this isn't the final product so in a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.950 
this isn't the final product so in a
couple<00:00:28.110> days<00:00:28.970> RSI<00:00:29.970> should<00:00:30.300> get<00:00:30.450> this<00:00:30.660> stuff

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
couple days RSI should get this stuff

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
couple days RSI should get this stuff
sorted<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.489> thing<00:00:32.669> I'll<00:00:32.820> look

let<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.130> think<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> top<00:00:50.730> speed<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
let you know is I think the top speed of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.549 
let you know is I think the top speed of
this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:52.110> let's<00:00:52.410> see

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this is going to be about well let's see

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.150 
this is going to be about well let's see
I<00:00:53.210> guess<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.600> 200

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I guess about 200

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
I guess about 200
not<00:00:56.760> 190<00:00:57.450> 190<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> top<00:00:58.380> speed<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.860> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
not 190 190 is the top speed for the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
not 190 190 is the top speed for the
gladiator<00:00:59.370> ladies<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.760> gentlemen<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.780> again

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
gladiator ladies and gentlemen but again

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440 
gladiator ladies and gentlemen but again
subject<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.560> change<00:01:01.860> well<00:01:02.730> I'll<00:01:02.910> fly<00:01:03.150> around<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
subject to change well I'll fly around a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:02:01.960 
subject to change well I'll fly around a
little<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.750> let<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.470> enjoy

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.400 

all<00:02:02.970> right<00:02:03.120> guys<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.690> thing<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.990> am<00:02:04.110> noticing

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
all right guys one thing I am noticing

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.050 
all right guys one thing I am noticing
is<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.740> obviously<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.430> landing<00:02:05.820> gear<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is that obviously the landing gear is

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.109 
is that obviously the landing gear is
still<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:08.130> not<00:02:08.310> retracting<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
still down it's not retracting so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
still down it's not retracting so
obviously<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.229> final<00:02:10.530> product<00:02:10.740> hopefully

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
obviously the final product hopefully

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.420 
obviously the final product hopefully
that's<00:02:11.430> obviously<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> correct<00:02:12.300> itself

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
that's obviously going to correct itself

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.760 
that's obviously going to correct itself
so<00:02:14.430> top<00:02:14.880> speeds<00:02:15.150> about<00:02:15.390> 190<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.350> thing<00:02:16.530> comes

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so top speeds about 190 this thing comes

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.400 
so top speeds about 190 this thing comes
with<00:02:16.980> 12<00:02:17.250> size<00:02:17.520> two<00:02:17.790> missiles<00:02:18.210> again<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
with 12 size two missiles again like I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.690 
with 12 size two missiles again like I
said<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> heck<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> lot<00:02:20.280> more<00:02:20.340> than<00:02:20.550> I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
said that's a heck of a lot more than I

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.720 
said that's a heck of a lot more than I
thought<00:02:21.170> bombay<00:02:22.170> i<00:02:22.200> believe<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.160> actually

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
thought bombay i believe is it actually

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.190 
thought bombay i believe is it actually
open<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.220> obviously<00:02:26.220> i've<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.900> two<00:02:27.900> mark

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
open and obviously i've got the two mark

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.330 
open and obviously i've got the two mark

maid or a buddy of mine in the turret at

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.589 
maid or a buddy of mine in the turret at
this<00:02:38.349> time<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:39.459> it'll<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.090> different<00:02:40.300> video

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
this time but it'll be a different video

this time but it'll be a different video
hopefully<00:02:41.050> I'll<00:02:41.440> do<00:02:42.129> another<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.550> once<00:02:42.790> they

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.940 
fix this landing gear issue but so far
the<00:02:46.569> maneuverability<00:02:47.319> of<00:02:47.349> this<00:02:47.530> thing<00:02:47.769> is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the maneuverability of this thing is

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.420 
the maneuverability of this thing is
fairly<00:02:48.370> close<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:49.030> my<00:02:49.180> Hornet<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:50.590> little

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
fairly close to my Hornet a little

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.770 
fairly close to my Hornet a little
clunkier<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.720> slower<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:53.379> overall<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
clunkier little slower but overall it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.800 
clunkier little slower but overall it
feels<00:02:56.160> relatively<00:02:57.160> familiar<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.480> if<00:02:58.690> you've

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
feels relatively familiar so if you've

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
feels relatively familiar so if you've
got<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.019> if<00:02:59.349> you<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> Hornet<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.670> will<00:03:00.910> feel

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
got a if you got a Hornet this will feel

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.080 
got a if you got a Hornet this will feel
pretty<00:03:01.870> much<00:03:01.989> right<00:03:02.170> at<00:03:02.290> home<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:03.549> little<00:03:03.940> bit

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
pretty much right at home a little bit

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
pretty much right at home a little bit
slower<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:04.690> yeah<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.799> know<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.250> is

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
slower but yeah you know what this is

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.009 
slower but yeah you know what this is
actually<00:03:06.760> fairly<00:03:07.000> good<00:03:07.329> I'm<00:03:07.510> actually<00:03:07.660> liking
