00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 hello my loves are welcome more 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.560
 once our kitchen and has a personal 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 that sometimes gets annoyed because I do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.420
 many recipes from the team are well admitted 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.619
 be an ambulance ant but I 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 trying to control me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.879
 and today I'm going to teach you a cake 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 That's the pizza it's actually the 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.730
 texture and taste are more or less one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 stuffed bread 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.900
 but the format is a goal and our 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 version of this dish takes a little longer than 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.379
 Do you have there in your house? 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.400
 write down the ingredients as I go to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.400
 the presence of teaching the preparation 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.840
 Good people, we 'll start doing 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.180
 the mass of our cake that is exactly 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.070
 equal to our perfect pizza dough. 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.720
 Maria Rita does not remember her anymore. 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.580
 teach you step by step to you 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.140
 the only difference is that you will fold 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.210
 the amount of ingredients I 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.009
 I put it so here you will use medium 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 also two tablespoons of flour 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.350
 salt tea a whole sachet 10 grams 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 of yeast Japan and an American cup of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.320
 warm water 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.270
 in the sequence you will mix sobá 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 let it rest and here I already have one 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 ready to explain to you the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:33.039
 next steps 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.840
 you should open a very thin layer and 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.060
 with the help of a knife from a pan 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.100
 small or high cake shape 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.670
 you should cut four circles like 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 this from here 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.330
 it is interesting to count the circles one 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 slightly larger than the base of the pan 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.220
 because the dough is shrinking a little 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.780
 not cut too a big return 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.290
 that is a little higher than it is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.820
 side of the pan passes dies with the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.820
 fork in every afternoon 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 At that moment you must be the one your 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 furnace at 180 degrees and cover two 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.899
 large baking sheets and the cake pan with 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 parchment paper 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.490
 I transfer circles to shapes and light 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.760
 to bake at medium temperature for 10 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.760
 minutes 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.210
 the rectangle people on the wall of the pot and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.210
 put a circus on the bottom 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 do not worry your circles 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.410
 stay a little dry a little bit 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300
 dry and after you find people 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.130
 meet and along with cheese with pt 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.810
 or im the dough will get wet in the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.020
 As far as people in the islands are concerned 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.020
 tonga 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130
 in the sequence spread a little sauce 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.020
 Tomatoes can be bought ready made 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.040
 at home and those of the peeled tomatoes 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.660
 people already taught you and add 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.980
 then a layer with one finger 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:18.730
 thickness of mozzarella cheese because the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 people beat perone should repeat this 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.980
 process until the last disk of forest 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.390
 to finely fold the edges of dough 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.280
 into the pan and bring to the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.209
 oven preheated to 200 degrees for about 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.209
 20 minutes 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.269
 let cool well then unmold 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:04.340
 like with your hands or with a fork and a knife 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:06.230
 saw the attack and said that it arrived 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.090
 time to see what you come home not 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.220
