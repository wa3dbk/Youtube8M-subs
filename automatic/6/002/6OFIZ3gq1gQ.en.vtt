 You come to the liver of the clipboard 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 This time you are inside a mac that says pages 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:44.520
 Start word processor software 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.790

 Drag with the mouse 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.560
 A cylinder

 When I say copy 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.140
 Again and again 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.300

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.990
 But this is only thing 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:28.189
 The point is that you need the necessary parts of the sentences you have made so far 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.190
 a Bring and paste Copy and paste 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 Copy and paste is what you can do 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:45.400
 So combine this copy and paste without having to type the same thing over and over 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.690
 I We want simply to say that Tteyuu'll be able to create quickly a sentence that 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.310
 so 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.750
 It does not stop only to the character of say this copy and paste 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 So are videos and so are music and so are photos 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.680
 Of Aichin 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.340
 If you had photos of children 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.180
 is not it 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 Right click 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.850
 Make a copy 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.800

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:20.260
 Switch to the currently running page 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:25.530
 The rest is from Ace with Ace 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.380
 By doing so from the photo management software from iphoto 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.270
 Photos on pages of word processing software 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:40.830
 It means that you can do things like copy and paste 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:43.440
 When it comes to using back more and more from now on various software information 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.620
 I will exchange 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.520
 It is this copy and paste that becomes the most basic 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.730
 It is after 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.970
 Though there is a large feed that cut on the copy 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 It's time to move cut 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.300
 It will be used when moving information 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 For example 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.310
 Karki Kuu Reiko

 Sometimes Kakikuke way that I want to continue thinking, Aki-ku Aki-ku, who under the alphabetical 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:25.300
 Look from the edit cut 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.010
 Take it under Aiueo and edit from English 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.510
 It's like moving it 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.990
 Please keep in mind that these things can also be done 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.980
 This concludes this video
