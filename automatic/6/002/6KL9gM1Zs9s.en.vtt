00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.970
 Welcome to a new motto view 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 First of all , I apologize that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.470
 he came for too long no video that neither 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.750
 now a new preview came on monday 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.530
 that was just because I was the whole 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.140
 week sick and lay in bed on sunday 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.320
 saturday monday of sickbeds 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 Constantly produce a video and then 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 on wednesday i have my micro in the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 Forgetting school certainly does not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 could produce video for thursday 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.170
 that's why the motto comes today 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.580
 a big apology to you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 Nonetheless, I'm getting to it now 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 murder today I do not put you one 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.830
 So the mod is not on now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.240
 very complicated but very cool 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.920
 namely extra to xl 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 what makes this mod this mod adds 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.190
 new organic types added yes I am too 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.759
 straight from a bio type inside namely 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.600
 the so-called from the place im must so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.950
 you can see the autumn forest here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 pretty horny trees so red and yellow and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 green 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.940
 There are green trees so different 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.179
 I personally like colored trees 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.599
 very horny from the learned on courage there is 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.399
 these blue trees then there 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.140
 Of course, this landscape is not the one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.289
 board already showed I show 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.819
 you now here again as a couple 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.020
 biome one because all who find 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.270
 bit complicated because then would have to 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.069
 I eternally make maps and then 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.319
 Let's go over each other 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.700
 a little bit on the 8th, that's why I'm still going 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.910
 few things that are still there 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.950
 very alpine thing with tall firs and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.580
 snow mountains this resides also ansinnen 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.739
 very cool from yes there are not new 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.099
 There are also some new items coming 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.770
 Of course, hardly once the old to 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.870
 towards the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.610
 the biom are conditional on this 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.070
 new stones for the red bio that have 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.290
 I you still the same this dance new 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.970
 there are flowers 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.730
 all those new leaves and the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.710
 whole new holzstÃ¤mme and it on 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.250
 stairs 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.450
 but there are also some new things coming 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.080
 add to the food here strawberries 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.960
 and chocolate 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.310
 besides, you can pass cactus pass 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.590
 then there are two completely new ones 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.560
 items that is the one time 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.390
 scarecrow the city her and the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.860
 sells most monsters from yours 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.490
 house so the monsters dare then 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:27.980
 not to go out or against it 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.810
 you see that is moving so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.480
 you can push it all over 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.760
 funny as well we have the after that 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.900
 Trunk spin the trunk trimmer with it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.270
 Can you have a legal on the trunk 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.650
 make and turn the trunk with it 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.600
 then you can get him one 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.680
 correct position will bring it all 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650
 practically if he houses, for example 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.810
 build since then and then build something up 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.470
 wanted and then EUR logs run to 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.630
 go 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.959
 you could just stand with that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.870
 turn and then in the right direction 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.760
 the tribe spin forces animal so halt 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.980
 is shaped again and the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.010
 scarecrow has a million body 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.660
 sticks and shopping 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.180
 yes that's actually so far from items 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.209
 and the first organic type 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.580
 I'll show you just a moment 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.320
 one more two we will see it then 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.000
 right back 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.250
 We are in the next boom type I 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.070
 personally find it pretty cool 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.510
 just a huge grassy area with here 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.640
 such a bit new trees new 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.240
 plants and otherwise small lakes and 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.100
 holes 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.640
 otherwise just huge grassy area 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.320
 In addition, one has borders here 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.180
 small marsh bio with new marsh trees 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.860
 which I think is pretty cool too 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.539
 but look these big firs 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.789
 and here we see a marsh wanton 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.009
 which is also pretty cool in vienna 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.509
 themselves are very cool here simply again 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.020
 we return to this alpine zone with the 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:09.189
 In any case you can tell something about tall fir trees 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.169
 and I mean who do I want 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:14.590
 like a house on a huge meadow 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.310
 the sun shines on every one of them 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.150
 pretty cool 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.939
 We'll see you soon forgotten 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.990
 to all bodies thirsting with heat 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.800
 bone 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.479
 yes we are in a kind of yes 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.939
 savanna desert region we have here 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:38.669
 Rothenstein therefore the iron-containing earth 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:42.159
 dried grass so brown grass 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.650
 that's going to be bleached up here 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.159
 camp and the whole on one 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.529
 plateau a bit at the wild 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.090
 so if you too too sometimes 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.379
 minecraft a little wild west movie 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.270
 it should be that they turn on everyone 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.659
 if the appropriate backdrop for it 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.610
 We also have little cacti and 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:04.360
 if you go down here you come here 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.389
 normal snow bio and back there in 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.620
 a small fir forest in any case 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.099
 this steppe plateau is also very 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.620
 beautiful 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.669
 Now we can be really horny 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.199
 forest huge trees 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.060
 Who wants to break down trees here is long 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.990
 Busy reaches a tree too 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.900
 huge trees get a great atmosphere 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.349
 between the trees perfect for 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:36.400
 Build tree cities by themselves 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.990
 just a very cool organic so good 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.729
 last for the frosty personalities 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:47.319
 among you an Alpine high mountain berger 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:50.589
 with alpine firs brings you one 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:52.539
 beautiful mountain flair over power 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:55.270
 Definitely fun to play here too 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.810
 you can look at wonderful almen in the 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.270
 mountains build big firs in 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.930
 sunshine 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.699

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.470

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.330

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.780
 plug-in review and then next week 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.759
 thursday again a motto view until 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.830
