 this one we're going to start talking about the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.250
 packaging comes in this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 always stirred cardboard packings 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.509
 a lot of attention and here says roller las 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 and in this part of here he tells you 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.700
 opinions of people who already 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 they proved that he is not supposed to sell 7 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.159
 percent of people said they saw 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 her eyelashes much longer 87 by 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.920
 hundred of the people said that he saw with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 laugh with your lashes full-length 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.160
 and 94 percent said they saw his eyes 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.020
 that looked a lot more open like that 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.140
 that when we saw all this and more and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 you will know everton because he is put on 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.729
 they are very high percentages in all 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 categories that supposed to make a mascara 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.850
 and it's supposed to be terrible 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.009
 replaces eyelash aggregator then 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 you apply it to enter your tabs and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.810
 fabrics have to make this seller 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.960
 any truth 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.970
 and this state is made of plastic and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.850
 this silicon trying to make a 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.270
 how these little tubes do that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.970
 They should use to straighten hair 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.030
 It is made of silicone wand also 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.760
 and then it's quite flexible and the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.220
 bristles have different sizes but 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.410
 the rather peculiar thing is that the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.230
 more half bristles are supposed to be 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.970
 those that are going to help us in the method of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.640
 heathrow that is so that our 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.500
 eyelashes are really curly and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.480
 let's move on to a demonstration that if 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.030
 it's not going to be so much more 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.819
 clear and you can see how this works 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.549
 river does not enchinado me absolutely 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.549
 none of my eyelashes so we 're going to 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.830
 try the mascara to its full potential and 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.549
 The first thing that has to be done is that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.500
 let's brush our lashes with 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.990
 this figure of the mascara that is as if 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.070
 it was a sad face 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.430
 and they are the longest bristles then I'm going 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.570
 to go with the biggest bristles more 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:08.120
 long from the root and giving a small 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.159
 strong turn appointment for the first curl 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.530
 from the root and you can see how it goes 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.650
 grabbing the eyelashes and when the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.549
 loose makes the curl 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.760
 and that same thing we repeat with all our 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:29.350
 lashes that is the method of playing a 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.710
 role that is to grab the tabs and turn 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.380
 we throw 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.420
 and that's how I like it 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.350
 too much as does the risk does the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.260
 super super pigmented formula and that 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.020
 I really like it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.690
 and nothing more 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.330
 I put all my eyelashes with mascara 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.120
 and that's how this eye looks like without 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.790
 use the truth eyelash curler 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.590
 hold this curl too much and now 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.720
 let's make the next eye 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.890
 using eyelash curler so that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720
 see the difference 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.500
 I'm going to do it twice almost always what 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.330
 I do like three or four times 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.900
 Y 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.580
 ok my tabs are now and now 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.650
 let's apply the mascara so you can see 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.600
 the difference from one tab to another 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.300
 because this rhythm can be used by 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.000
 any way if you want with curling iron or 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.940
 without a curler and again on the face 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.790
 sad of the river I'm going to the real ones of 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:36.480
 the tabs and I give a little spin 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.480
 grabbing the eyelashes 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.850
 and there's the first curl 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.380
 I will do the same with all my 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.380
 tabs to see the difference 

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.079
 d 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.260
 is that in this eye do not use in 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.600
 china door or eyelash curler and in 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.729
 yes and I think the truth is both 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.880
 they look very similar although there is no 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.070
 used the curler in this eye makes a 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.160
 very nice curl they already saw as a 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.860
 apply the mascara and I never loved 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 he used it with the jimador unless 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.900
 go out in the night when I want 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.750
 a much more dramatic effect but my 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.810
 lashes are very very jazz are 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.050
 thin are not at all heavy and yet 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.570
 that's how the good worked for me 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.040
 of the beauty district is that they have two 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.400
 opinions about everything we tried 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.190
 but it's a pretty weird case because 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.380
 use this remake and I did not have the effect 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.180
 that I would wait because emotions do not 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.990
 I'm using in china door and then 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.470
 by televen and linking tabs 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.050
 but it's giving me super little and 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.590
 I think it's because I have some 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.560
 Very heavy lashes are pretty Texas 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.530
 they are thick and thanks the falls with 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.670
 another no mascara or anything seems that no 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:14.450
 I have so I have absolutely nothing 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.980
 of tabs then this should be 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.200
 also to the formula that has to 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.160
 our water and ice oil test 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:26.450
 that the formula of the mascara is very creamy 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.150
 heavy and it's also pretty pigmented 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.400
 I really liked that, but it was not 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.870
 really what I had expected although 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.120
 yes I liked it is the bird that is 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.550
 pigmented and then things in china 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.550
 even though 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.380
 it takes some time to dry this 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.600
 also the formula takes a little bit of 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.370
 time to dry nothing else they have to 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.740
 remember that so they do not go out to 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.780
 fill with mascara we throw something 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.750
