00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.709 
this time if you notice the boot logo
when<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.100> start<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.579> iphone<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.420> says

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
when you start up the iphone it says

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.700 
when you start up the iphone it says
wild<00:02:02.229> rain<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.259> alert<00:02:05.590> your

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
wild rain so if this is the alert your

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.160 
wild rain so if this is the alert your
website<00:02:06.159> then<00:02:06.369> why<00:02:06.610> does<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.240> say<00:02:07.450> TK<00:02:07.929> at<00:02:08.049> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
website then why does it say TK at the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.670 
website then why does it say TK at the
end<00:02:08.319> of<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:09.099> makes<00:02:09.369> no<00:02:09.459> sense<00:02:09.789> at<00:02:09.910> all<00:02:10.680> and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
end of it it makes no sense at all and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.800 
end of it it makes no sense at all and
so<00:02:12.459> pretty<00:02:12.879> much<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.360> same<00:02:13.569> thing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
so pretty much this the same thing

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.960 
so pretty much this the same thing
important<00:02:14.650> information<00:02:14.739> my<00:02:15.280> senselessly<00:02:15.760> had

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
important information my senselessly had

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.289 
important information my senselessly had
serious<00:02:16.360> problem<00:02:16.810> too<00:02:17.080> blah<00:02:17.470> blah<00:02:17.590> blah<00:02:17.620> and

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
serious problem too blah blah blah and

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.710 
serious problem too blah blah blah and
has<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.450> same<00:02:19.660> download<00:02:20.110> links<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.510> first

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
has the same download links so the first

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.500 
has the same download links so the first
typical<00:02:23.349> way<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.880> they<00:02:25.090> somehow

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
typical way is out you know they somehow

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.410 
typical way is out you know they somehow
discovered<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.610> untethered<00:02:27.610> jailbreak<00:02:27.849> when

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
discovered a untethered jailbreak when

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.509 
discovered a untethered jailbreak when
you<00:02:28.810> know<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.410> dev<00:02:29.620> team<00:02:29.829> isn't<00:02:30.069> working<00:02:30.400> on

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
you know the dev team isn't working on

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.039 
you know the dev team isn't working on
it<00:02:30.640> pretty<00:02:30.760> hard<00:02:30.880> lately<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.720> they<00:02:31.870> pretty

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
it pretty hard lately and they pretty

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.750 
it pretty hard lately and they pretty
much<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.349> reasons<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.890> whites<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.370> tethered

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
much have reasons of whites on tethered

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.400 
much have reasons of whites on tethered
outside<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.920> that's<00:02:36.910> one<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.750> second<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.349> that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
outside so that's one the second is that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.979 
outside so that's one the second is that

the interface of the application on the

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.809 
the interface of the application on the
videos<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.590> similar<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.130> black<00:02:42.430> rain<00:02:44.819> lime

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
moved on to other things and so it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.979 
moved on to other things and so it
doesn't<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:00.880> sense<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.299> how<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.660> wall
