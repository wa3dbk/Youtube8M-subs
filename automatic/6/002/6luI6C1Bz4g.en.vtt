00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.979 
make the playoffs for back-to-back years
and<00:00:32.940> probably<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.690> time<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and probably be the first time in a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.360 
and probably be the first time in a
while<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.620> making<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
while did they do that making the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979

can you remember the last time they did

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
can you remember the last time they did
that<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.670> obviously<00:00:39.300> Buffalo<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> bottom

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that and obviously Buffalo at the bottom

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
that and obviously Buffalo at the bottom
of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> East<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> palm<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> NHL

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of the East I think the palm the NHL

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
of the East I think the palm the NHL
five<00:00:42.719> points<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.200> 13<00:00:43.530> games<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
five points in 13 games or kind of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.830 
five points in 13 games or kind of
already<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.700> Cell<00:00:44.969> mode<00:00:45.180> even<00:00:45.570> though<00:00:45.690> we're

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
already in Cell mode even though we're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
already in Cell mode even though we're
already<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> late<00:00:46.260> late<00:00:46.530> October<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
already in late late October here so it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.860 
already in late late October here so it
kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> explains<00:00:48.239> why<00:00:48.480> these<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.840> teams

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
kind of explains why these two teams

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
kind of explains why these two teams
made<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> deal<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.010> bold<00:00:50.280> moves<00:00:50.520> on

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
made this deal the pretty bold moves on

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
made this deal the pretty bold moves on
both<00:00:50.850> parts<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.660> mean<00:00:52.050> guys<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.350> look<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
both parts but I mean guys we look at a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
both parts but I mean guys we look at a
closer<00:00:52.860> look<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> deal<00:00:53.460> Matt<00:00:54.180> Moulson

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
closer look at this deal Matt Moulson

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
closer look at this deal Matt Moulson
compared<00:00:54.899> Tom<00:00:55.199> Thomas<00:00:55.559> Vanek<00:00:55.800> 1<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> 1<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> think

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
compared Tom Thomas Vanek 1 to 1 I think

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
compared Tom Thomas Vanek 1 to 1 I think
Thomas<00:00:56.969> Vanek<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.510> probably<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.140> a-minus

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
Thomas Vanek is probably like an a-minus

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
Thomas Vanek is probably like an a-minus
player<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> better

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
player you know one of the better

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
player you know one of the better
players<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> NHL<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> superstar

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
players in the NHL but not a superstar

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
players in the NHL but not a superstar
more<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.910> player<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.449> know

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
more like a good player but you know

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.429 
more like a good player but you know
nothing<00:01:03.899> crazy

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
nothing crazy

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
nothing crazy
and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.799> Matt<00:01:04.979> Moulson<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> probably<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and then Matt Moulson is probably like a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
and then Matt Moulson is probably like a
be<00:01:06.119> maybe<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> b-plus<00:01:06.930> player<00:01:07.229> obviously<00:01:07.950> gets

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
be maybe a b-plus player obviously gets

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
be maybe a b-plus player obviously gets
a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> support<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:09.869> his<00:01:10.020> center<00:01:10.290> there

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
a lot of support from his center there

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.750 
a lot of support from his center there
and<00:01:10.470> John<00:01:10.650> Tavares<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> best<00:01:11.520> players

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and John Tavares one of the best players

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
and John Tavares one of the best players
in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> game<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.510> personally<00:01:12.990> probably

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
in the game I think personally probably

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
in the game I think personally probably
top-five<00:01:13.740> player<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> game<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.460> now

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
top-five player in the game right now

Mannix<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.750> bit<00:01:21.930> better<00:01:22.020> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
Mannix probably a little bit better your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
Mannix probably a little bit better your
skill<00:01:22.530> wise<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.610> drastically

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
skill wise on you know not drastically

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
skill wise on you know not drastically
better<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.570> definitely<00:01:24.960> better<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:25.710> we

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
better but definitely better and then we

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
better but definitely better and then we
look<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.040> their<00:01:26.159> age<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.640> both<00:01:26.820> 29<00:01:27.180> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
wouldn't say prime but you know n to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.899 
wouldn't say prime but you know n to
prime<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> their<00:01:32.280> career<00:01:32.579> they're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
start kind of you know the next 2 or 3

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.530 
start kind of you know the next 2 or 3
years<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.340> after<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> next<00:01:36.150> 2<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.270> 3<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.520 
years probably after the next 2 or 3 is
probably<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.960> start<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> bit<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
probably when we start to see a bit of a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.080 
probably when we start to see a bit of a
decline<00:01:37.860> obviously<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.030> all

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

little<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.250> 3<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.729> 4<00:01:51.299> million<00:01:51.600> dollars<00:01:51.899> more

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

little over 3 so 4 million dollars more
for<00:01:52.259> Vanek<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.770> basically<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.700> -

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
for Vanek so basically you could have -

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.160 
for Vanek so basically you could have -
Matt<00:01:54.060> Moulson<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.659> extra<00:01:54.990> million

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
Matt Moulson it's an extra million

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
Matt Moulson it's an extra million
dollars<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> price<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> an<00:01:56.340> ik<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.790> want

to<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.049> think

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to look at it that way and I think

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.510 
to look at it that way and I think
that's<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> reasons<00:01:58.979> Buffalo<00:01:59.280> really

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's one of the reasons Buffalo really

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.709 
that's one of the reasons Buffalo really
wanted<00:01:59.790> Molson<00:02:00.119> obviously<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.540> got<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
wanted Molson obviously it's got the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.330 
wanted Molson obviously it's got the
cheap<00:02:00.930> contract<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.619> they're<00:02:02.009> looking<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
cheap contract if they're looking to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.709 
cheap contract if they're looking to
keep<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.670> around<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.180> re-sign<00:02:03.540> them

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
keep them around they can re-sign them

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
apologized I got traded for a first

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.260 
apologized I got traded for a first
round<00:02:16.860> pick<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.250> Matt<00:02:17.670> Moulson<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.060> think's

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
round pick so Matt Moulson I think's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.640 
round pick so Matt Moulson I think's
worth<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.540> least<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.870> first<00:02:19.140> round<00:02:19.320> pick<00:02:19.350> at

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
worth at least a first round pick at

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.140 
worth at least a first round pick at
this<00:02:19.800> year's<00:02:19.980> trade<00:02:20.190> deadline<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:21.000> can

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
this year's trade deadline if they can

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.760 
this year's trade deadline if they can
get<00:02:21.330> even<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.750> first-round<00:02:22.080> pick<00:02:22.200> obviously<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
get even a first-round pick obviously I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.750 
get even a first-round pick obviously I
think<00:02:22.860> they<00:02:23.040> could<00:02:23.130> probably<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.490> first

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
think they could probably get a first

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790 
think they could probably get a first
and<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> high-level<00:02:24.210> prospect<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.590> just

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and a high-level prospect on that just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
and a high-level prospect on that just
going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> basically<00:02:26.250> double<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.810> return

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
going to basically double the return

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.210 
going to basically double the return
they<00:02:27.960> got<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.170> Van<00:02:28.320> Dyck's<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.740> they<00:02:28.860> say<00:02:29.040> do

but also guys if he does decide to say
to<00:03:21.480> me<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.690> interesting<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.110> see<00:03:22.140> what

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to me really interesting to see what

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.680 
to me really interesting to see what
pricey<00:03:22.830> stays<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:23.640> Tom<00:03:24.390> Smith<00:03:24.570> is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
pricey stays that because Tom Smith is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.090 
pricey stays that because Tom Smith is
making<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.019> little<00:03:25.200> over<00:03:25.320> seven<00:03:25.620> right<00:03:25.739> now<00:03:25.769> I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
making a little over seven right now I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.800 
making a little over seven right now I
think<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> reasonable<00:03:27.420> price<00:03:27.600> for

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
think you know a reasonable price for

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.600 
think you know a reasonable price for
him<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.080> somewhere<00:03:28.350> between<00:03:28.769> six<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> six<00:03:29.519> and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
him is somewhere between six and six and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.949 
him is somewhere between six and six and
a<00:03:29.640> half<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.300> open<00:03:30.600> market

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
a half but that's on the open market

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.330 
a half but that's on the open market
if<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.350> Islanders<00:03:31.620> want<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.830> resign<00:03:32.100> them<00:03:32.250> I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
if the Islanders want to resign them I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.140 
if the Islanders want to resign them I
think<00:03:32.430> they're<00:03:32.670> probably<00:03:32.820> gonna<00:03:33.000> say

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
think they're probably gonna say

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.790 
think they're probably gonna say
something<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.480> we're<00:03:34.200> paying<00:03:34.410> John<00:03:34.590> Tavares

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
something like we're paying John Tavares

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.410 
something like we're paying John Tavares
five<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> half<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.209> good<00:03:36.239> as

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
five and a half you're not as good as

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.600 
five and a half you're not as good as
John<00:03:36.570> Tavares<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.320> we'll<00:03:37.800> give<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:37.980> five<00:03:38.340> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
John Tavares so we'll give you five and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.070 
John Tavares so we'll give you five and
then<00:03:39.030> Vanek's<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> say<00:03:39.660> something<00:03:39.989> like

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
then Vanek's going to say something like

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.100 
then Vanek's going to say something like
I<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.620> easily<00:03:40.890> get<00:03:41.130> seven<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:41.910> free<00:03:42.540> agency<00:03:42.630> so

I can easily get seven in free agency so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.570 
I can easily get seven in free agency so

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.280 
I don't know how those contract
negotiations<00:03:45.209> are<00:03:45.269> going<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.480> go<00:03:45.540> down<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.260> I

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
negotiations are going to go down so I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.199 
negotiations are going to go down so I
think<00:03:46.410> if<00:03:46.680> Vanek<00:03:46.980> walks<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.730> deal<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.000> even

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
think if Vanek walks this deal is even

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.729 
think if Vanek walks this deal is even
worse<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.690> Islanders<00:03:49.080> but<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.530> they<00:03:49.620> are

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
worse for the Islanders but if they are

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.470 
worse for the Islanders but if they are
able<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.040> keep<00:03:50.340> them<00:03:50.489> even<00:03:51.120> if<00:03:51.209> they<00:03:51.300> pay<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
able to keep them even if they pay a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.940 
able to keep them even if they pay a
more<00:03:51.690> than<00:03:51.780> Tavares<00:03:52.110> which<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.350> kind<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.560> weird

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
more than Tavares which is kind of weird

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.680 
more than Tavares which is kind of weird
but<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.700> they<00:03:53.880> are<00:03:54.030> able<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.300> keep<00:03:54.510> them<00:03:54.630> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
but if they are able to keep them I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.000 
but if they are able to keep them I
think<00:03:54.780> it's<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.080> decent<00:03:55.290> deal<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.739> them<00:03:55.830> but

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
think it's a decent deal for them but

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.009 
think it's a decent deal for them but
still<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.910> give<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.150> outright<00:03:57.510> win<00:03:57.720> to

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
still I think I give the outright win to

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.990 
still I think I give the outright win to
Buffalo<00:03:58.440> also<00:03:58.980> guys<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.250> decided<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.730> simulate

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
Buffalo also guys I decided to simulate

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.740 
Buffalo also guys I decided to simulate
