alright my little chart says that we
need<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.520> set<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.120> number<00:00:46.540> one<00:00:46.720> intake<00:00:47.470> side

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
need to set the number one intake side

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.470 
need to set the number one intake side
first<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:48.610> I'm<00:00:48.790> going<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.030> start<00:00:49.240> with<00:00:49.390> that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
one my little tool slides over the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.690 
one my little tool slides over the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
pushrod in first and then sits down on

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.110 
pushrod in first and then sits down on
top<00:00:55.060> of<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.270> roller<00:00:55.420> tip<00:00:55.690> end<00:00:56.790> what<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:57.820> do<00:00:58.000> is

little pointer moves and it tells you
how<00:01:04.540> many<00:01:05.019> pounds<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.560> pressure<00:01:05.619> on<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.460> now

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
how many pounds of pressure on that now

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.060 
how many pounds of pressure on that now
the<00:01:07.450> way<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.690> tell<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.500> come<00:01:08.680> back<00:01:08.830> down

here and you pull until the top of the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.430 
here and you pull until the top of the
valve<00:01:13.150> starts<00:01:13.480> to<00:01:13.720> move<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.320> see

record it so if we come back up here to
the<00:01:31.930> numbers<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:34.090> now<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.420> sitting<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.690> 0

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
the numbers right now it's sitting on 0

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.050 
the numbers right now it's sitting on 0
I<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.470> have<00:01:35.590> any<00:01:35.740> pressure<00:01:36.010> I'm<00:01:36.760> just<00:01:36.909> gonna

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
I don't have any pressure I'm just gonna

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.310 
I don't have any pressure I'm just gonna
start<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.479> pull<00:01:37.860> pull<00:01:39.840> alright<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.960> looks<00:01:41.020> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
start to pull pull alright it looks to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.160 
start to pull pull alright it looks to
be<00:01:41.440> about<00:01:41.530> 115<00:01:42.490> pounds<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.659> just<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.020> make

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
be about 115 pounds and just to make

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.620 
be about 115 pounds and just to make
sure<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.830> he<00:01:45.640> didn't<00:01:45.880> see<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.120> wrong<00:01:46.330> and

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
sure that he didn't see it wrong and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.330 
sure that he didn't see it wrong and
that<00:01:46.780> wasn't<00:01:47.020> pulling<00:01:47.860> too<00:01:47.979> hard<00:01:48.010> or

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
that wasn't pulling too hard or

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.560 
that wasn't pulling too hard or
something<00:01:48.610> like<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.940> want<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.270> do<00:01:49.360> each

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
something like that I want to do each

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.120 
something like that I want to do each
one<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.900> them<00:01:50.020> at<00:01:50.140> least<00:01:50.290> twice<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.040> I'll

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
one of them at least twice and I'll

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.350 
one of them at least twice and I'll
start<00:01:51.400> over<00:01:51.490> again<00:01:51.850> pull<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.880> still<00:01:55.150> looks

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
start over again pull that still looks

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.510 
start over again pull that still looks
like<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.540> hundred<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:55.870> fifteen<00:01:56.260> pounds<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.070> we

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
like a hundred and fifteen pounds so we

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.390 
like a hundred and fifteen pounds so we
will<00:01:57.670> record<00:01:57.940> 115<00:01:58.690> pounds<00:01:58.930> for<00:01:59.830> this<00:01:59.950> cylinder

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
will record 115 pounds for this cylinder

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.100 
will record 115 pounds for this cylinder
then<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.180> says<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.450> need<00:02:01.510> to<00:02:01.630> do<00:02:01.750> number<00:02:01.990> one

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
then it says I need to do number one

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.480 
then it says I need to do number one
exhaust<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:02.770> I'm<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.010> come<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.340> number

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
exhaust so I'm going to come to number

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.109 
exhaust so I'm going to come to number
one<00:02:03.670> exhaust<00:02:04.170> works<00:02:05.170> exactly<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.740> same<00:02:05.860> way

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
one exhaust works exactly the same way

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.140 
one exhaust works exactly the same way
pull<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.299> in<00:02:07.890> alright<00:02:08.890> that's<00:02:09.489> about<00:02:09.670> 150<00:02:10.179> 120

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
pull on in alright that's about 150 120

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.119 
pull on in alright that's about 150 120
alright<00:02:13.150> looks<00:02:13.420> about<00:02:13.569> 115<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.680> both<00:02:14.889> of<00:02:15.010> these

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
alright looks about 115 so both of these

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.130 
alright looks about 115 so both of these
for<00:02:15.760> 115<00:02:16.540> pounds

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
for 115 pounds

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.080 
for 115 pounds
pressure<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.069> what<00:02:18.190> I'm<00:02:18.280> gonna<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.730> record

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
pressure so what I'm gonna do is record

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.690 
pressure so what I'm gonna do is record
each<00:02:19.960> one<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.350> these<00:02:20.470> they're<00:02:21.160> gonna<00:02:21.250> work<00:02:21.490> my

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
each one of these they're gonna work my

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
each one of these they're gonna work my
way<00:02:21.730> down<00:02:21.880> exactly<00:02:22.569> like<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.870> set<00:02:23.080> my<00:02:23.200> valve

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
way down exactly like I set my valve

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.140 
way down exactly like I set my valve
lash<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:23.980> instead<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.310> lash<00:02:24.459> I'm<00:02:24.850> checking

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
lash but instead of lash I'm checking

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.330 
lash but instead of lash I'm checking
the<00:02:25.330> springs<00:02:25.660> check<00:02:26.440> all<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.800> them<00:02:27.010> we'll<00:02:27.130> put

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the springs check all of them we'll put

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.559 
the springs check all of them we'll put
them<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> chart<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.030> I'll<00:02:28.120> show<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.390> what

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
them in the chart and I'll show you what

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.309 
them in the chart and I'll show you what
we're<00:02:28.690> looking<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:31.450> are<00:02:31.630> our<00:02:31.810> valve

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
we're looking for here are our valve

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.290 
we're looking for here are our valve
spring<00:02:32.680> numbers<00:02:33.100> these<00:02:33.490> are<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> pressures

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
spring numbers these are the pressures

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.570 
spring numbers these are the pressures
it<00:02:34.450> came<00:02:34.600> out<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.290> don't<00:02:36.160> know<00:02:36.280> if<00:02:36.400> that's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
it came out with I don't know if that's

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.220 
it came out with I don't know if that's
really<00:02:36.820> accurate<00:02:37.000> or<00:02:37.360> not<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.660> don't<00:02:37.900> know<00:02:38.080> if

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
really accurate or not I don't know if

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.900 
really accurate or not I don't know if
that<00:02:38.380> Springs<00:02:38.740> really<00:02:38.980> sitting<00:02:39.190> at<00:02:39.310> 120

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
that Springs really sitting at 120

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
that Springs really sitting at 120
pounds<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.570> may<00:02:40.750> actually<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:41.050> 130<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:41.740> my

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
pounds it may actually be 130 because my

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.380 
pounds it may actually be 130 because my
tool<00:02:42.100> could<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.340> off<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.970> don't<00:02:43.209> really

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
tool could be off but I don't really

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.570 
tool could be off but I don't really
care<00:02:43.630> about<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:44.980> carry<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.400> just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
care about that what I carry is just

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.670 
care about that what I carry is just
about<00:02:45.760> repeatability<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.810> want<00:02:47.319> all<00:02:47.500> these

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
about repeatability I want all these

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140 
about repeatability I want all these
numbers<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> be<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.520> close<00:02:48.790> they're

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
numbers to be pretty close they're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.690 
numbers to be pretty close they're
almost<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.630> same<00:02:49.709> most<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.860> them<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.130> 115<00:02:51.670> or

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
almost the same most of them are 115 or

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.830 
almost the same most of them are 115 or
120<00:02:52.300> we<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.840> two<00:02:53.260> there's<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.340> 110<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.330> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
120 we do have two there's a 110 and a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.020 
120 we do have two there's a 110 and a
125<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> little<00:02:57.430> bit<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.820> was<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
125 that are a little bit this was a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.759 
125 that are a little bit this was a
little<00:02:58.180> bit<00:02:58.269> heavier<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> little<00:02:59.650> bit

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
little bit heavier this was a little bit

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.949 
little bit heavier this was a little bit
lighter<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.700> still<00:03:01.000> not<00:03:01.300> all<00:03:01.510> far<00:03:01.810> off

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
lighter but it's still not all far off

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.590 
lighter but it's still not all far off
from<00:03:02.170> my<00:03:02.380> baseline<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.980> about<00:03:03.220> 115<00:03:03.820> or<00:03:03.850> 120<00:03:04.390> so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
from my baseline of about 115 or 120 so

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.300 
from my baseline of about 115 or 120 so
I'm<00:03:04.750> good<00:03:04.959> here<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.350> usually<00:03:06.040> what<00:03:06.190> you're

valves<00:03:14.769> they're<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.550> pretty<00:03:15.790> close<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
valves they're all pretty close and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.030 
valves they're all pretty close and
pressure<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> know<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.110> valve<00:03:17.440> hasn't<00:03:17.860> given

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
pressure so I know a valve hasn't given

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.370 
pressure so I know a valve hasn't given
up<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.400> me<00:03:18.640> if<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.420> start<00:03:19.690> checking<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.170> and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
up on me if you start checking this and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.979 
up on me if you start checking this and
one<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:20.680> comes<00:03:20.980> out<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.430> say<00:03:21.730> 80<00:03:22.060> you

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
one of these comes out to be say 80 you

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.780 
one of these comes out to be say 80 you
know<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> valve<00:03:23.440> spring<00:03:23.620> started<00:03:24.190> giving<00:03:24.459> up<00:03:24.579> on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
know a valve spring started giving up on

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.449 
know a valve spring started giving up on
you<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.260> last<00:03:26.500> video<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:26.980> set<00:03:27.190> valve

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
you so in the last video we set valve

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.430 
you so in the last video we set valve
lash<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.480> video<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.900> checked<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.230> valve

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
lash in this video we checked the valve

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.620 
lash in this video we checked the valve
springs<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.220> let's<00:03:30.640> be<00:03:30.760> honest<00:03:31.090> usually<00:03:31.510> when

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
springs and let's be honest usually when

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.240 
springs and let's be honest usually when
a<00:03:31.660> motor<00:03:31.870> blows<00:03:32.140> up<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:32.860> something

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
a motor blows up it's because something

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.400 
a motor blows up it's because something
failed<00:03:33.519> in<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.820> valve<00:03:34.000> train<00:03:34.299> because<00:03:35.110> we

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
failed in the valve train because we

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.720 
failed in the valve train because we
checked<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> valve<00:03:35.920> lash<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:36.519> know<00:03:36.640> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
checked the valve lash and we know the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.460 
checked the valve lash and we know the
lash<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.239> correct<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.959> nothing<00:03:38.350> had<00:03:38.440> changed

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
lash is correct and nothing had changed

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.199 
lash is correct and nothing had changed
I<00:03:38.980> know<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.160> haven't<00:03:39.430> eaten<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.700> lobe<00:03:39.880> off<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
I know I haven't eaten a lobe off the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.600 
I know I haven't eaten a lobe off the
cam<00:03:40.450> or<00:03:41.230> nothing's<00:03:41.620> giving<00:03:41.980> up<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.280> valves

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
cam or nothing's giving up the valves

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.370 
cam or nothing's giving up the valves
not<00:03:42.790> stretched<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.420> me<00:03:43.540> I've<00:03:43.930> checked<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
not stretched on me I've checked the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.720 
not stretched on me I've checked the
valve<00:03:44.560> spring<00:03:44.890> pressures<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.519> they're<00:03:45.640> all

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
valve spring pressures and they're all

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.069 
valve spring pressures and they're all
pretty<00:03:45.880> much<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.239> same<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> know<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.930> don't

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
pretty much the same so I know I don't

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.449 
pretty much the same so I know I don't
have<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.380> valve<00:03:47.650> spring<00:03:47.799> getting<00:03:48.160> where<00:03:48.340> you're

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
have a valve spring getting where you're

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.370 
have a valve spring getting where you're
giving<00:03:48.760> up<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.630> be<00:03:49.720> pretty<00:03:49.959> confident

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
giving up so I can be pretty confident

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.009 
giving up so I can be pretty confident
than<00:03:50.560> my<00:03:50.650> valve<00:03:50.860> springs<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:51.910> rocker<00:03:52.600> arms

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
than my valve springs and my rocker arms

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.490 
than my valve springs and my rocker arms
and<00:03:53.260> all<00:03:53.650> my<00:03:53.829> valve<00:03:54.100> train<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.670> gonna<00:03:55.239> live<00:03:55.500> no

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
and all my valve train is gonna live no

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.650 
and all my valve train is gonna live no
I<00:03:56.530> said<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:57.850> we<00:03:58.030> should<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.360> pretty<00:03:58.540> good

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
I said that but we should be pretty good

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.110 
I said that but we should be pretty good
all<00:03:59.380> right<00:03:59.470> that<00:04:00.100> concludes<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.610> video<00:04:00.730> we've

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
all right that concludes the video we've

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.509 
all right that concludes the video we've
got<00:04:01.360> everything<00:04:01.900> checked<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.680> know<00:04:03.010> my<00:04:03.280> valve

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
got everything checked I know my valve

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.800 
got everything checked I know my valve
train<00:04:03.760> should<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.180> good<00:04:04.329> shape<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.690> we're

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
train should be in good shape and we're

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.040 
train should be in good shape and we're
ready<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.019> go<00:04:05.170> race<00:04:05.380> another<00:04:05.680> weekend
