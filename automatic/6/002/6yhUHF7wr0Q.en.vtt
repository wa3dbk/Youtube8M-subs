in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> teens<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.230> he<00:00:55.559> has

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in the teens but you see like he has

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
in the teens but you see like he has
like<00:00:55.890> eight<00:00:56.100> Neil's<00:00:56.399> wing<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> click

like eight Neil's wing he has to click
cause<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.730> scales<00:01:00.300> like

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
cause like the for like scales like

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.979 
cause like the for like scales like
pretty<00:01:01.230> much<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.329> dragonforce<00:01:03.329> but

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
pretty much it's like dragonforce but

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.140 
pretty much it's like dragonforce but
gone<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> extreme<00:01:04.890> I'm<00:01:05.129> guessing<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.790> lot

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
gone to the extreme I'm guessing a lot

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.190 
gone to the extreme I'm guessing a lot
of<00:01:06.210> people<00:01:06.510> saying<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.020> probably

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of people saying like this is probably

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.630 
of people saying like this is probably

that made this arc like one thing in
this<00:01:38.369> artist<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.150> being<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.540> bad<00:01:39.780> act<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
this artist is being a bad act but that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
this artist is being a bad act but that
was<00:01:40.799> worthwhile<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.479> I

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
was worthwhile like just to see that I

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.929 
was worthwhile like just to see that I
might<00:01:42.899> we're<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.649> over<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> wall<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.790> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
might we're got over the wall if that is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.569 
might we're got over the wall if that is
just<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.570> color<00:01:45.899> paste<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.579> don't

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
just like a little color paste I don't

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
just like a little color paste I don't
is<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.939> expect<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> Kenzi<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.079> policy

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
is if I expect that Kenzi because policy

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.889 
is if I expect that Kenzi because policy
no<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.399> big<00:01:50.820> Neil<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.210> keeping<00:01:51.540> his<00:01:51.659> power

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
no like big Neil was keeping his power
and<00:01:52.140> check<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> guess<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.220> although<00:01:53.700> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and check I guess in a way although you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.490 
and check I guess in a way although you
know<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.570> he<00:01:54.689> always<00:01:54.840> been<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.229> shot<00:01:55.470> now

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
entire time but it's like this could

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
entire time but it's like this could
