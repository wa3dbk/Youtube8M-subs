you<00:00:21.990> place<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.260> tire<00:00:22.859> lever<00:00:23.189> underneath<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you place one tire lever underneath the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
you place one tire lever underneath the
bead<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> rim<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:27.050> lift<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
bead of the rim a lift up and over the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.330 
bead of the rim a lift up and over the
rim<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> tire<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:31.260> take<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> second<00:00:32.130> tire

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
rim the tire you take the second tire

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.459 
rim the tire you take the second tire
lever<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> run<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> around<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
lever and you run it around the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.610 
lever and you run it around the
circumference<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.550> rim<00:00:36.440> removing<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
circumference of the rim removing the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.300 
circumference of the rim removing the
bead<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> tire

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.510 

when<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.450> done<00:00:46.590> start<00:00:47.590> at<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.830> valve<00:00:48.190> and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
when that is done start at the valve and

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.890 
when that is done start at the valve and
you<00:00:49.030> can<00:00:49.210> take<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.570> valve<00:00:49.840> out<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.670> then<00:00:52.600> pull

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
you can take the valve out and then pull

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.730 
you can take the valve out and then pull
out<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.230> tube<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.540> need<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.050> take<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.380> tube

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
out the tube now you need to take a tube

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.830 
out the tube now you need to take a tube
I<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.370> partially<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.970> displayed<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.690> like

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
I like to partially a displayed it like

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.130 
I like to partially a displayed it like
this<00:01:02.080> one<00:01:02.550> find<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.760> stem<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.420> find<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.960> hole

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
this one find the stem and find the hole

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.180 
this one find the stem and find the hole
for<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.500> stem<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> put<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.850> through<00:01:07.150> first

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.090 

if<00:01:15.190> your<00:01:15.640> stem<00:01:16.000> has<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.300> retaining<00:01:16.870> screw<00:01:17.530> just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
if your stem has a retaining screw just

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.780 
if your stem has a retaining screw just
slide<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.760> on<00:01:18.940> right<00:01:19.210> now<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:21.340> you're<00:01:21.640> going

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
slide it on right now now you're going

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.770 
slide it on right now now you're going
to<00:01:21.850> need<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.210> seat<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.780> tube<00:01:23.110> into<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.100> tire

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.540 

this<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.990> why<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.320> helps<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:29.770> bit<00:01:29.920> partially

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
this is why it helps a bit partially

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.180 
this is why it helps a bit partially
inflated<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:34.170> next<00:01:35.170> step<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:35.710> see<00:01:35.920> at<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
inflated the next step is see at the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.730 
inflated the next step is see at the
bead<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.640> tire<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:37.330> sit<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.900> rim<00:01:38.110> this

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
bead of the tire to sit in the rim this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.200 
bead of the tire to sit in the rim this
is<00:01:38.800> just<00:01:39.190> done<00:01:39.400> with<00:01:39.550> your<00:01:39.729> hands<00:01:39.970> just

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
is just done with your hands just

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.050 
is just done with your hands just
popping<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.869> over<00:01:41.200> top<00:01:41.410> of<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.710> rib<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.759> should

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
popping it over top of the rib it should

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.999 
popping it over top of the rib it should
go<00:01:43.240> pretty<00:01:43.270> easily<00:01:43.900> depending<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.770> type

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
go pretty easily depending on the type

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:55.600 
go pretty easily depending on the type
of<00:01:45.040> tire<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.670> have

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.150 

and<00:01:56.120> usually<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.810> last<00:01:57.050> few<00:01:57.440> inches<00:01:57.680> are<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
and usually the last few inches are the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.260 
and usually the last few inches are the
toughest<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.980> then<00:02:01.160> just<00:02:01.310> give<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.700> tap<00:02:01.970> all

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
toughest and then just give it a tap all

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.110 
toughest and then just give it a tap all
the<00:02:02.510> way<00:02:02.600> around<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:03.290> make<00:02:03.470> sure<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
the way around to make sure that on the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.350 
the way around to make sure that on the
rim<00:02:05.330> properly<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.980> tighten<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.670> retaining

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
rim properly now tighten the retaining

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.979 
rim properly now tighten the retaining
screw<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.429> valve

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.270 

and<00:02:18.989> now<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.440> ready<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> inflate<00:02:20.250> your

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and now you're ready to inflate your

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.170 
and now you're ready to inflate your
tire<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.000> proper<00:02:21.540> tire<00:02:21.750> pressure
