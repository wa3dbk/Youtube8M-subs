00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:12.059
 Coming I wanted to put out the biggest concept is natural to still emotional part 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 It is more interface than the past smartphone 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.300
 With much of the focus also sympathetic to each other in terms of products or aspects of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.330
 Designed 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330
 Ah 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:32.980
 Well , that kind of thing has a cup with a theme called Minimal Pogo. 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:37.780
 I have advanced technology, but people are like that technology. 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:41.080
 The meaning that technology does not need and people tailor to it is worth it 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.550
 Let's touch those designed so writes 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.070
 b9 How to implement a button for appearance or to be drawn inside 10 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.100
 I needed a new version. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.370
 Which it was not just a representation of the technology 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.320
 Design emotion or sound shade 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 The way to appeal to emotion is the most important. 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.420
 We are constantly preparing for globalization. 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.199
 Ah 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:24.440
 When you're designing a new product, you 're going to have an inspiration trip. 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 At the Marina Bay Hotel in Singapore , the landscape , the sky and the city, 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.030
 Well-matched 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.380
 I saw a picture-like landscape of the width of the Galaxy s3 window part of the water 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 I wanted to bring that up before I was full . 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.160
 There is the flowing water in the valley, where the pebble has sunlight 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.080
 I saw a glittering appearance. 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:52.970
 How can I put some kind of flow and reflection on the phone? 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.660
 I have a lot of troubles. Usually hairline is implemented through chemical corrosion. 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:02.940
 I wanted to feel a little more natural . 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:08.490
 Directly handed one hand sweat has very craftsmanship to implement 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:13.260
 There are many layers on the battery cover of the Galaxy s3 . 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:19.400
 Polycarbonate basically becomes the base, and the three coat paint goes up 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.989
 Again, the multi-coating goes up, but the multi-coating has been done five times. 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.230
 The subtle angle of light changes the design so that the elegance of the soul 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:32.480
 Wool Cargo Round Shape and Square 1 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.310
 60 The combination of these modules makes it a compact design and a good fit 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.819
 To create a round design 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:43.900
 It's very difficult, it's been through a lot of trial and error, 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.900
 It was the result of the creation. 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:55.099
 Oh Well most leading technology get in when the users are confronted with two phones 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:00.859
 But when users use it, they can not feel the technology 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:05.510
 I focused on designing naturally and comfortably and impressively 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:06.319
 I am worried about what is most natural to something and what is closest to reality 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.189
 So I wrote a lot 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:14.569
 I bought the phone and switched it on first 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:17.209
 Touching the web would be now proceed to order in various situations so that 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.099
 Give the feeling of the forest bath did so cried 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:26.090
 This was my concern. I first came to the water because the surface was water. 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:31.069
 Actually the sound is slightly more viscous than the work liquid is more beautiful 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.049
 Did I hear I found it was juice, milk Toka Toka such as Yoplait 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:40.579
 And then signals the more viscous liquids and finally 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:45.169
 The sound that we have applied to the Dialer Nazi 4 is 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:51.200
 When I put my orange juice in a small cup and dropped my building 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:53.200
 Then the sound from the moment it's been very appropriately now directing 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 U 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.640
 What we have noticed the most is that we understand the usage patterns of our users. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:10.440
 To study what kind of gestures to use 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.860
 To recognize the shortness of the angle and the snow on the user's eyes 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.950
 Come'm staring to put the technology in the galaxy s3 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:25.590
 The user sees this unlocking screen very high frequency of this screen 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:30.810
 I wanted that baby to have some fun imagination on that screen . 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.990
 For example, users can spend their hands on consumption 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:39.210
 You can pick up water with your feet. 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:45.450
 Well suited to the cool breeze going on a bicycle always feel when even throw 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.890
 It's a fun and good experience so you can apply that stuff to digital media. 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.930
 I wonder 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:57.300
 If the first impression is warm and comfortable, but also increasingly used gonna make the world community 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:02.220
 In order to find a new place to have as a lot of effort this 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.880
 As the various technologies that support the peaceful quiet while in the east 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:11.310
 I am very pleased with the fact that I have risen 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.360
 Galaxy s is not a product of the past, but now a new smartphone 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.390
 I'd like to emphasize that it's a start. 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.390
 U
