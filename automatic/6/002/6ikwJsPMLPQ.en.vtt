00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.460
 Bartholomew's laughter said it all and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.630
 is that is not the kind of questions 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.790
 that one expects to hear from bites 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.130
 religious mid-19th century clear 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.130
 that the eyes what happens is that play 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.200
 it is not a priest either since 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.930
 boy year was going to be someone close to 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.760
 the young people used to say 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.390
 if I were a priest it would be different 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.700
 it was as well as a December 8 , 1841 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.380
 the young priest was encouraged to caress the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.410
 soul of that poor boy hired 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.000
 by the sacristan today more than 15,000 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.780
 Salesians consecrated working in 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.370
 1,800 houses from 130 countries on the fruit 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 of that first bird marÃ­a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 and I'm convinced that every 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
 Once a child enters want Jose Juan 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 He smiles and not only who lives for 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 always with God but also the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 Juan who lives in the hearts of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.839
 those who continue his work 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.820
 and hundreds of hearts the store at 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.710
 beat of a rhythm that does not understand 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 punches neither of punishment nor of exclusions 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.070
 We are like a big family that rolls 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 says a well-known creation 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.130
 enter the ditch is to enter home is 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 entering the home a home is a place 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.660
 where one feels comfortable or that we 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.110
 recognizes as his own because in it he 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.670
 feels welcomed embraced sheltered to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.670
 saved happy 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.460
 I like to think of sanjo as that 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 little piece of the world where life 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 he understands he feels and above all he 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.470
 lives in a different way a place where 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.420
 breathe a different air where among the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.420
 you kill the guitar and the soccer god 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.770
 potter is molding us each me 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 like to think of the sack as a place 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.320
 where life does not stop 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.330
 I like to think about the ditch how is the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.810
 place where the word the ear earns 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.810
 The sanction 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.950
 I like to think of Sanjo as a 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.380
 place where holiness consists in 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.600
 always be cheerful but not happy 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.620
 what I have business but to have the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.110
 heart put in god 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.120
 I like to think of sanjo as that 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.790
 place where we understand that a caress 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
 can more than a blow a look more 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.690
 that a punishment 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.610
 a hug more than a shout 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 I like to think of sanjo as that 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 place where hope reigns to see 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.810
 As we do little children 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.810
 big 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.820
 Salesian house San Jose 125 years 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.820
