what<00:02:38.340> ended<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.670> happening<00:02:38.750> was<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
what ended up happening was that it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.440 
what ended up happening was that it
didn't<00:02:40.500> take<00:02:40.739> all<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> way<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.880> didn't<00:02:42.209> take

didn't take all the way it didn't take

that's<00:02:44.580> why<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.820> noticed<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> lot<00:02:45.810> of

that's why you noticed you see a lot of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's why you noticed you see a lot of
