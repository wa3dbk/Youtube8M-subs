another<00:00:20.940> one<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.150> those<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:21.690> green<00:00:22.170> maps

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
another one of those very green maps

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.680 
another one of those very green maps
it's<00:00:23.190> got<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> nice<00:00:23.760> placement<00:00:24.090> honestly<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the desert just kind of in the bottom

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
the desert just kind of in the bottom
there<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.190> you<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.910> little<00:00:27.180> point

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
there and you know that little point

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.109 
there and you know that little point
shape<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.490> very<00:00:29.820> very

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
shape I do like that it's very very

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
shape I do like that it's very very
green<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:31.289> fight<00:00:31.529> remember<00:00:31.859> correctly<00:00:32.129> down

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
green in a fight remember correctly down

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.889 
green in a fight remember correctly down
in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> bottom<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.539> noticed

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in the bottom right there if you noticed

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.100 
in the bottom right there if you noticed
I<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> mushroom<00:00:35.370> biome<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.690> if

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
I think that is a mushroom biome so if

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
I think that is a mushroom biome so if
it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.980> map<00:00:38.190> does<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.790> biomes

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
it is then this map does have all biomes

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420 
it is then this map does have all biomes
I<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:40.500> quite<00:00:40.739> remember<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.309> want

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
I don't quite remember so I don't want

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.590 
I don't quite remember so I don't want
to<00:00:41.520> guarantee<00:00:41.880> you<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.480> I'm

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
to guarantee you that it is but I'm

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
to guarantee you that it is but I'm
almost<00:00:42.870> positive<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
almost positive that down there is a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
almost positive that down there is a
mushroom<00:00:44.640> biome<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.420> everything

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
mushroom biome so you do have everything

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
mushroom biome so you do have everything
but<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.100> sure<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but I'm sure you want to see that the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
but I'm sure you want to see that the
best<00:00:48.629> part<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.680> videos<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.309> always

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
best part is like all my videos I always

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400 
best part is like all my videos I always
have<00:00:50.790> something<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.510> great<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> every<00:00:52.230> map

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
have something really great on every map

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
have something really great on every map
to<00:00:52.590> show<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.070> sure<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> just

to show you and I'm sure you just
wanting<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.309> will

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wanting to see what that is so we will

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
wanting to see what that is so we will
start<00:00:56.789> right<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:58.200> three<00:00:58.410> villages

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
start right here there's three villages

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
start right here there's three villages
on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> map<00:00:59.370> this<00:01:00.030> being<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.809> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
on the map this being the first one it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.420 
on the map this being the first one it's
really<00:01:01.320> small<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.010> these<00:01:02.160> coordinates

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
really small it's at these coordinates

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.889 
really small it's at these coordinates
obviously<00:01:03.030> I've<00:01:03.120> had<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> while

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
obviously I've had them up for a while

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
obviously I've had them up for a while
so<00:01:04.170> you'll<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> able<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.829> get<00:01:04.979> them<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so you'll be able to get them but as you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.870 
so you'll be able to get them but as you
see<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.600> small<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.259> mean<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.069> two

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
see it's pretty small I mean it's two

see it's pretty small I mean it's two
three<00:01:09.270> houses<00:01:09.749> and<00:01:09.899> although<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.439> nothing

three houses and although well nothing
special<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.579> just<00:01:12.209> kind<00:01:12.389> of<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.959> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
special but just kind of like think of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.959 
special but just kind of like think of
it<00:01:13.139> as<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.319> outpost<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.039> won't<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.759> quite<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
it as an outpost and won't be quite so

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.760 
it as an outpost and won't be quite so
disappointed<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.749> not<00:01:15.959> having<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.439> giant

disappointed and not having the giant
buildings<00:01:17.219> but<00:01:18.090> what's<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.139> best<00:01:19.499> part<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
buildings but what's the best part of

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.559 
buildings but what's the best part of
this<00:01:19.950> map<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.399> gonna<00:01:20.579> be<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.909> past<00:01:21.209> this<00:01:21.389> way

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
this map is gonna be right past this way

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.599 
this map is gonna be right past this way
and<00:01:21.749> no<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.349> not<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.709> burning<00:01:23.099> chicken<00:01:23.340> her

down in this direction this is gonna be

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.779 
down in this direction this is gonna be
basically<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:01.079> spawn<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.429> remember

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
basically at your spawn if I remember

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.639 
basically at your spawn if I remember
when<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> spawned<00:02:03.359> on<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> map<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.109> was<00:02:04.349> right

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
when I spawned on this map I was right

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.729 
when I spawned on this map I was right

at this village it might have been right
around<00:02:09.660> here<00:02:09.959> somewhere

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
around here somewhere

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.289 
around here somewhere
I<00:02:10.649> mean<00:02:11.219> don't<00:02:11.340> quote<00:02:11.610> me<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.939> but<00:02:12.150> it's

to call this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.130 
to call this
baan<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.150> would<00:02:16.269> be<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> easiest<00:02:16.930> way<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
baan this would be the easiest way to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.289 
baan this would be the easiest way to
show<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.920> seat<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.700> here<00:02:18.879> we<00:02:19.000> are<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
show you the seat so here we are at the

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.759 
show you the seat so here we are at the
spa<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.810> chord<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.379> right<00:02:20.530> around<00:02:20.620> here

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
spa and I chord it's a right around here

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.690 
spa and I chord it's a right around here
you<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:20.950> kind<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.129> see<00:02:21.310> where<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.489> is<00:02:21.549> on<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
you can kind of see where it is on the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can kind of see where it is on the
map<00:02:21.909> obviously<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.510> don't<00:02:22.569> need<00:02:22.720> spawn

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
map obviously you don't need spawn

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.140 
map obviously you don't need spawn
coordinates<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.519> right<00:02:24.549> in<00:02:24.879> front<00:02:25.090> of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
coordinates but you go right in front of

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.039 
coordinates but you go right in front of
you<00:02:25.239> you've<00:02:25.390> got<00:02:25.540> another<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.989> these

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
you you've got another one of these

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.920 
you you've got another one of these
small<00:02:26.500> villages<00:02:26.909> where<00:02:27.909> you<00:02:28.540> know<00:02:28.629> it's<00:02:28.810> a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
some stuff it's beginning and then you

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.160 
some stuff it's beginning and then you
go<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> little<00:02:37.090> bit<00:02:37.329> farther<00:02:37.599> across<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
go a little bit farther across the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.860 
go a little bit farther across the
desert<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.799> like<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.450> will<00:02:40.629> drop

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
desert just like so and I will drop

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.240 
desert just like so and I will drop
these<00:02:41.110> coordinates<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.099> make

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
these coordinates just so you can make

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.649 
these coordinates just so you can make
sure<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.459> go<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:42.909> direction<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
sure you go in the right direction you

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.899 
sure you go in the right direction you
will<00:02:43.930> find<00:02:44.260> another<00:02:44.799> village<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.579> more

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
will find another village is more

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.330 
will find another village is more
sizeable<00:02:46.420> one<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.829> probably<00:02:47.829> a<00:02:47.859> better<00:02:48.010> place

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
sizeable one so probably a better place

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
seed has right between these villages at
spawn<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.769> probably<00:03:06.430> gonna<00:03:06.579> make<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:06.909> for<00:03:07.120> that

one of the points that it meets it so
here's<00:03:46.690> your<00:03:46.840> coordinates<00:03:47.319> in<00:03:47.379> case<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> want

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.259 
you can dig all the way down in a
straight<00:03:53.590> line<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.730> you'll<00:03:54.910> just<00:03:55.030> kind<00:03:55.239> of

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
straight line and you'll just kind of

mention when I am giving these
coordinates<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.090> show<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.989> is

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
coordinates that the show that it is

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.800 
coordinates that the show that it is
safe<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.530> drop<00:04:08.949> in<00:04:09.160> there<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:10.329> won't<00:04:10.599> just

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
safe to drop in there and you won't just

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.949 
safe to drop in there and you won't just
get<00:04:10.959> murdered<00:04:11.669> but<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:12.790> round<00:04:13.000> off<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.599> spawn

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
get murdered but the round off the spawn

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.020 
get murdered but the round off the spawn
we<00:04:14.230> have<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.620> go<00:04:14.709> over<00:04:14.859> here<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.609> seems

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
we have to go over here and it seems

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
we have to go over here and it seems
like<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.209> far<00:04:16.449> distance<00:04:16.810> away<00:04:16.900> but<00:04:17.349> believe<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
like a far distance away but believe it

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.409 
like a far distance away but believe it
or<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.250> still<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.639> stronghold<00:04:19.120> over

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
or not this is still the stronghold over

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.300 
or not this is still the stronghold over
here<00:04:19.599> so<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.560> can<00:04:20.620> see<00:04:20.680> it's<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.949> pretty

here so as you can see it's a pretty

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.100 
here so as you can see it's a pretty
large<00:04:21.699> stronghold<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.419> stretch<00:04:22.660> all<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.020> way
