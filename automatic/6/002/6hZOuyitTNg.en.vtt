00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
theory the USB power bank should charge

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.869 
theory the USB power bank should charge
just<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.629> fast<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.800> AC<00:02:11.160> adapter<00:02:11.580> I've<00:02:11.700> got

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
just as fast as the AC adapter I've got

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.940 
just as fast as the AC adapter I've got

yecchh<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.330> s6<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:15.930> gonna<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.200> ahead<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
yecchh and the s6 I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.949 
yecchh and the s6 I'm gonna go ahead and
power<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.489> USB<00:02:17.940> power<00:02:18.090> bank<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.720> let<00:02:18.900> me

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
power with the USB power bank so let me

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.880 
power with the USB power bank so let me
go<00:02:19.080> ahead<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.319> plug<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.099> s6<00:02:20.730> edge<00:02:20.970> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
go ahead and plug in the s6 edge and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
go ahead and plug in the s6 edge and
also<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.489> galaxy<00:02:24.120> s6<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:25.530> gonna<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:25.860> ahead

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
also the galaxy s6 I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.600 
also the galaxy s6 I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:26.040> turn<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.550> USB<00:02:27.030> power<00:02:27.269> bank<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.610> you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and turn on the USB power bank and you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.300 
and turn on the USB power bank and you
can<00:02:29.730> see<00:02:29.879> I'm<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.180> 3<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.720> 3%<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.980> s6

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
can see I'm actually 3 at 3% for the s6

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
can see I'm actually 3 at 3% for the s6
edge<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.360> think<00:02:33.630> 0%<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.130> s6<00:02:35.519> at<00:02:35.730> 1%<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
edge and I think 0% for the s6 at 1% and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.870 
edge and I think 0% for the s6 at 1% and
we'll<00:02:37.349> start<00:02:37.590> from<00:02:37.709> there<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.580> I'll<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.819> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
we'll start from there and I'll have a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.300 
we'll start from there and I'll have a
timer<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:41.480> ready<00:02:42.480> set<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.840> all<00:02:43.280> right

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
timer on here and ready set go all right

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.650 
timer on here and ready set go all right
so<00:02:45.120> 1%<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.810> galaxy<00:02:46.290> s6<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.069> 3%<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:48.150> s6<00:02:48.480> edge

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
so 1% for galaxy s6 and 3% for s6 edge

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.750 
so 1% for galaxy s6 and 3% for s6 edge
let's<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.470> how<00:02:49.560> long<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.920> takes<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.220> charge<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
let's see how long it takes to charge to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:09.559 
let's see how long it takes to charge to
50%

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569

the s6 at 50% also s6 edge at 53% it

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.899 
the s6 at 50% also s6 edge at 53% it
took<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.959> s6<00:03:25.349> edge<00:03:25.469> about<00:03:25.799> 50<00:03:26.280> about<00:03:26.639> 30

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
took the s6 edge about 50 about 30

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.940 
took the s6 edge about 50 about 30
minutes<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.420> would<00:03:27.569> say<00:03:27.689> just<00:03:27.900> under<00:03:28.650> 30

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
minutes I would say just under 30

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.949 
minutes I would say just under 30
minutes<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:30.030> course<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.450> one<00:03:30.629> started

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
minutes and of course this one started

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.709 
minutes and of course this one started
at<00:03:31.019> 1%<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.099> got<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.370> reach<00:03:32.489> with<00:03:32.719> 51%

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
at 1% so we just got to reach with 51%

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.059 
at 1% so we just got to reach with 51%
we<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.439> did<00:03:34.620> I'm<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.430> both<00:03:36.019> charged<00:03:37.019> under<00:03:37.739> 30

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
we just did I'm so both charged under 30

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.220 
we just did I'm so both charged under 30
minutes<00:03:38.159> up<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.639> 50%<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:39.749> you<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.139> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
minutes up to 50% but you can see the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.949 
minutes up to 50% but you can see the
performance<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.249> USB<00:03:41.669> power<00:03:41.909> bank<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.569> no

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
performance of the USB power bank is no

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.470 
performance of the USB power bank is no
different<00:03:43.469> from<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.859> AC<00:03:44.010> wall<00:03:44.280> adapter<00:03:44.480> also

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
different from the AC wall adapter also

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.379 
different from the AC wall adapter also
works<00:03:45.900> very<00:03:46.049> well<00:03:46.290> overall<00:03:47.219> I<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.030> like

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
works very well overall I really like

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.509 
works very well overall I really like
this<00:03:48.569> device<00:03:49.079> especially<00:03:49.500> because<00:03:50.129> it

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
this device especially because it

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.580 
this device especially because it
supports<00:03:50.969> quick<00:03:51.239> charging<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.260> device

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
supports quick charging for the device

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.220 
supports quick charging for the device
itself<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.120> my<00:03:54.269> complaints<00:03:54.930> with

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
itself now one of my complaints with

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.559 
itself now one of my complaints with
traditional<00:03:55.980> USB<00:03:56.400> power<00:03:56.609> banks<00:03:57.000> especially

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
traditional USB power banks especially

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.409 
traditional USB power banks especially
the<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:58.560> micro<00:03:59.310> USB<00:03:59.790> input<00:03:59.819> for

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
the one with micro USB input for

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.330 
the one with micro USB input for
charging<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.319> they<00:04:01.469> don't<00:04:01.650> charge<00:04:01.949> fast

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
charging is that they don't charge fast

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.520 
charging is that they don't charge fast
enough<00:04:02.699> um<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.569> have<00:04:03.719> to<00:04:03.870> actually<00:04:03.989> plug<00:04:04.379> it

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
enough um so I have to actually plug it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.020 
enough um so I have to actually plug it
in<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.889> couple<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.129> hours<00:04:05.219> before<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.760> can

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
in for a couple of hours before I can

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.509 
in for a couple of hours before I can
actually<00:04:06.180> use<00:04:06.719> the<00:04:06.989> power<00:04:07.230> bank<00:04:07.500> itself<00:04:07.859> now

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
actually use the power bank itself now

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.759 
actually use the power bank itself now
