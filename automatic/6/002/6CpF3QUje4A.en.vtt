00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
proof I've been using it for a while and
there<00:01:36.479> been<00:01:36.630> no<00:01:36.810> scratches<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.070> also<00:01:38.400> oddly

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
there been no scratches it is also oddly

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
there been no scratches it is also oddly
shaped<00:01:39.150> when<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> place<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.770> kind<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
shaped when you place it down it kind of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.850 
shaped when you place it down it kind of
wobbles<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.299> spins<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.560> kind<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
wobbles a bit and it spins and I kind of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
wobbles a bit and it spins and I kind of
find<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> annoying<00:01:44.970> side

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
find that a little on the annoying side

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.749 
find that a little on the annoying side
but<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.920> shape<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.460> this

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
but I do kind of like the shape of this

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.060 
but I do kind of like the shape of this
case<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.270> definitely<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
case and definitely like the look of the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.550 
case and definitely like the look of the
combination<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> materials<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> speaking

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
combination of materials so the speaking

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.639 
combination of materials so the speaking
capella<00:01:52.950> case<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.700> yours<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.210> 2995<00:01:54.899> you
