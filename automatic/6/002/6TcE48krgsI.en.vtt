00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.380
 so percent and cross each other and I speak for several reasons 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.699
 the first not dispatch because I do not know how to play music 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.029
 I would have loved that 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.029
 so here is the high school I often need to 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.179
 to fill the silence 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.210
 and m probably talked a lot of times I would like it 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.230
 do the piano playing an instrument and it would probably tell you a lot 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.399
 better what I feel 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.810
 and at the same time that's how I never learned yesterday 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.190
 because I want to talk to forget that I had 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.180
 I do not know I'm making music 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.580
 why I'm still talking to each other 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150
 a lot on its own it's a way of 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.840
 the ump is a way to stand up there I think finally to encourage me in 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.130
 a few things c 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 not otherwise little hungry speak for me with the rattles at home feeling in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.300
 you 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 when I write that I'm a bit like eugen at I thought the other day a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.690
 as if I were on a deserters beach 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.200
 when we have an end of the day I'm doing pies 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.150
 dig tunnels and subterranean species 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.940
 and m and I'm not sure why I'm doing this often when I write 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.820
 I ask myself the question to myself and why you do that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.670
 % and this is especially true before I wrote the night because I 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.160
 worked the day and r 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.550
 percent who had all the time this question why is it why 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.180
 do you do that finally c 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.420
 it was that it was special sandcastles a little weird side 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.730
 building 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.060
 and the word comes when 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 when it's over when in a certain way this kind of buildings a 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.119
 little fragile is over and that someone passed 10% like it is not bad 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 without being amazed and the swell helmet why did you do that I would not have it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.539
 do like this 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.800
 where it's going to break your mouth a little bit 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.260
 and percent and I like it I like that moment of change 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.310
 she the word comes after speech comes a posteriori from a certain 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 way for 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.320
 yes to say the book maybe why self the lot includes of 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.680
 end to make it more adapted brighter to oneself self i have 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.070
 the impression that I understand my books 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.130
 2 I'm starting to get an idea of ​​why I write them percent when 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.580
 I will not start talking about it
