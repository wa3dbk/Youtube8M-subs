00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 [Music] 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.500
 for the joke of this balloon that rescue 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 is that I have to paste the string to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.220
 leslie with this to see who I give and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.220
 you can move lists 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.230
 Hahaha 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 the fireman notes 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.459
 my life 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.879
 it is very difficult this 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.879
 do not 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.550
 no no no 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.769
 and a paper we finished this blog and not 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.560
 we have brought you the toys blog 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.139
 of our leslie and mine toys 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.910
 are in a cellar then we do and 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.470
 for them but when we have them 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.690
 we promise that we would have blog phase 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.699
 and if you want the next video 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.020
 let's ask questions and answers give law 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.000
 so that we know how many 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.550
 Polynesians want from questions and 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.360
 answers exactly and then we see by 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 beginnings but more 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.220
 have a listening 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.099
 if it's going to bring more easier I think that 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.099
 here 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.220
 to see now he has to catch area 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.240
 Hahaha 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.919
 Y 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.919
 I would lose because I did not catch it 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.650
 Leave the Marian ancestors living this 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.760
 that's why I recommend the land area there 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.760
 here where with your life 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.830
 and that's how the area went by the wand 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:48.120
 sometimes someone is the air of consummate 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.080
 but not 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.080
 Oh 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:59.699
 to consummate her very happy the 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.699
 lifetime 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.930
 very well 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.470
 although they give it to you small it can already there it is 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.470
 lay down 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.570
 saves the ship and its bullet from it and 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:20.560
 languages because she was wearing his bullet 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:24.810
 dragging but she can 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.810
 that I did not calculate to grab the rod
