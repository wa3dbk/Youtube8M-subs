hey<00:00:02.939> guys<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.389> we're<00:00:03.690> going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.899> take<00:00:04.230> a

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hey guys today we're going to take a

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.710 
hey guys today we're going to take a
look<00:00:04.590> at<00:00:04.769> how<00:00:04.920> set<00:00:05.310> up<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.640> rolling<00:00:06.029> TD<00:00:06.389> 10

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
look at how set up the rolling TD 10

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.290 
look at how set up the rolling TD 10
module<00:00:07.380> with<00:00:07.710> pin<00:00:07.950> tech<00:00:08.160> drums<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.849> cymbals

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
module with pin tech drums and cymbals

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.160 
module with pin tech drums and cymbals
the<00:00:10.170> module<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.769> I'm<00:00:10.890> using<00:00:11.190> has<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.880> TD<00:00:12.269> w1

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the module that I'm using has the TD w1

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.770 
the module that I'm using has the TD w1
expansion<00:00:13.890> in<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.220> but<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> settings<00:00:15.540> should

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
expansion in it but the settings should

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.800 
expansion in it but the settings should
also<00:00:15.990> work<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> regular<00:00:17.519> TD<00:00:17.939> 10<00:00:18.210> module

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
also work for the regular TD 10 module

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.779 
also work for the regular TD 10 module
let's<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.860> ahead<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.100> take<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.280> look<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.130 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
module<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.690> those<00:00:21.869> settings<00:00:23.930> okay<00:00:24.930> we

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
module and get those settings okay we

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769 
module and get those settings okay we
have<00:00:25.350> our<00:00:25.380> TD<00:00:25.949> 10<00:00:26.220> started<00:00:26.850> so<00:00:27.180> let's<00:00:27.270> go<00:00:27.570> ahead

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
have our TD 10 started so let's go ahead

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.859 
have our TD 10 started so let's go ahead
and<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> area<00:00:30.600> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and look at how to get to the area to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.069 
and look at how to get to the area to
change<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> settings<00:00:32.300> I'm<00:00:33.300> gonna<00:00:33.420> press<00:00:33.750> the

for<00:00:42.270> trigger<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> you'll<00:00:44.910> notice<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.540> it's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
for trigger and you'll notice that it's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.619 
for trigger and you'll notice that it's
the<00:00:46.320> bank<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.160> selected<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> start

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the bank is selected we want to start

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
the bank is selected we want to start
off<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:50.040> where<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.520> select<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
off there that's where we select this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.590 
off there that's where we select this
specific<00:00:51.750> trigger<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:53.059> ok<00:00:54.059> let's<00:00:54.360> take<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
specific trigger time ok let's take a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.860 
specific trigger time ok let's take a
look<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.200> different<00:00:55.559> triggers<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> 12

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
look at the different triggers for a 12

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
look at the different triggers for a 12
inch<00:00:58.140> drum<00:00:59.660> 212<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:01.699> great<00:01:02.699> 10<00:01:03.030> inch<00:01:04.129> it's<00:01:05.129> gonna

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
inch drum 212 a great 10 inch it's gonna

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.649 
inch drum 212 a great 10 inch it's gonna
be<00:01:05.399> 10<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.170> my<00:01:07.170> kick<00:01:07.529> drum<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:09.689> k12<00:01:10.529> and<00:01:11.450> all<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
be 10 a my kick drum is k12 and all of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.999 
be 10 a my kick drum is k12 and all of
my<00:01:12.840> cymbals<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.679> hi-hat<00:01:14.279> ride<00:01:14.749> crashes

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
my cymbals the hi-hat ride crashes

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.550 
my cymbals the hi-hat ride crashes
they're<00:01:17.009> all<00:01:17.189> gonna<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.759> c1<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.289> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
they're all gonna be the c1 a if you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.809 
they're all gonna be the c1 a if you
have<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> tvw<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.979> okay<00:01:22.979> let's<00:01:23.279> go<00:01:23.429> into<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
have the tvw one okay let's go into the

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.499 
have the tvw one okay let's go into the
basic<00:01:24.329> setting<00:01:25.490> okay<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.060> where<00:01:27.270> we're

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
basic setting okay this is where we're

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.239 
basic setting okay this is where we're
gonna<00:01:27.599> adjust<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> sensitivity<00:01:28.679> and<00:01:29.219> the

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
gonna adjust the sensitivity and the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.170 
gonna adjust the sensitivity and the
threshold<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> curve

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.800 

for<00:01:33.930> our<00:01:34.020> snare<00:01:34.410> set<00:01:34.800> at<00:01:34.950> five<00:01:35.690> with<00:01:36.690> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
for our snare set at five with the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
for our snare set at five with the
threshold<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.190> got<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.430> linear<00:01:38.880> curve

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
threshold of two it's got a linear curve

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.090 
threshold of two it's got a linear curve
that's<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:41.010> 12-inch<00:01:41.610> snare<00:01:43.580> my<00:01:44.580> 10-inch<00:01:45.000> tom

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
that's a 12-inch snare my 10-inch tom

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.880 
that's a 12-inch snare my 10-inch tom
has<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.550> sensitivity<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.450> three<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.290> threshold

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
has the sensitivity of three a threshold

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.270 
has the sensitivity of three a threshold
of<00:01:50.310> five<00:01:50.600> all<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> drums<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> cymbals<00:01:53.130> are

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of five all of the drums and cymbals are

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.450 
of five all of the drums and cymbals are
of<00:01:53.430> course<00:01:53.730> gonna<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.420> linear<00:01:54.780> curve

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
of course gonna have that linear curve

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.780 
of course gonna have that linear curve
and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> 12-inch<00:01:57.360> Tom<00:01:58.460> you'll<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and then a 12-inch Tom you'll know this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.100 
and then a 12-inch Tom you'll know this
is<00:01:59.910> gonna<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> same<00:02:00.660> settings

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
is gonna have the same settings

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.240 
is gonna have the same settings
