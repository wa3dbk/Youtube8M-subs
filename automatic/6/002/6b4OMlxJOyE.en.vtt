00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
involved the more a distortion and great

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.939 
involved the more a distortion and great
do<00:05:57.879> you<00:05:57.909> get<00:05:58.210> if<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:58.930> keep<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.259> down<00:05:59.379> lower<00:05:59.650> it

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949

cleans<00:06:00.279> up<00:06:00.520> pretty<00:06:00.699> nicely<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.169> think<00:06:02.349> it

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
cleans up pretty nicely and I think it

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.409
