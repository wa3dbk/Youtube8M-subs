2012 and we're here showcasing our new
hinged<00:00:16.990> carrier<00:00:17.410> for<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.680> JK<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:19.300> what<00:00:19.480> we've

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
hinged carrier for the JK now what we've

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.930 
hinged carrier for the JK now what we've
developed<00:00:20.080> here<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.500> carrier<00:00:20.950> system<00:00:21.460> for

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:21.940 
developed here is a carrier system for

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.700 
developed here is a carrier system for
the<00:00:22.030> tailgate<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.780> spare<00:00:23.050> tire<00:00:23.320> for<00:00:23.650> the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
the tailgate and the spare tire for the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.740 
the tailgate and the spare tire for the
JK<00:00:24.160> Wrangler<00:00:24.370> first<00:00:25.090> off<00:00:25.330> we<00:00:25.480> wanted

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
JK Wrangler first off we wanted

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.450 
JK Wrangler first off we wanted
something<00:00:26.140> simple<00:00:26.440> we<00:00:26.890> wanted<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.220> tire

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
something simple we wanted a tire

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.580 
something simple we wanted a tire
carrier<00:00:27.760> that<00:00:28.150> would<00:00:28.270> open<00:00:28.690> with<00:00:28.720> one<00:00:29.140> action

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
carrier that would open with one action

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.190 
carrier that would open with one action
and<00:00:29.800> one<00:00:30.100> hand<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:30.850> so<00:00:31.300> we<00:00:31.420> needed<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.750> develop

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
and one hand and so we needed to develop

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.010 
and one hand and so we needed to develop
something<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.559> opened<00:00:32.980> with<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.309> tailgate

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
something that opened with the tailgate

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.480 
something that opened with the tailgate
second<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.440> tire<00:00:35.620> carrier<00:00:35.890> needed<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.370> be

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
second the tire carrier needed to be

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.790 
second the tire carrier needed to be
strong<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.300> during<00:00:38.260> research<00:00:38.620> and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
strong and during research and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.990 
strong and during research and
development<00:00:39.220> for<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.430> product<00:00:39.730> we

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
development for this product we

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
development for this product we
discovered<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:41.050> there's<00:00:41.260> substantial

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
discovered that there's substantial

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.530 
discovered that there's substantial
structure<00:00:42.550> here<00:00:42.730> in<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.880> corner<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.329> tub

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
structure here in the corner of the tub

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.330 
structure here in the corner of the tub
on<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.780> JK<00:00:44.140> Wrangler<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.130> we<00:00:45.220> took

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
on the JK Wrangler and so we took

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.100 
on the JK Wrangler and so we took
advantage<00:00:45.400> of<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.090> by<00:00:46.600> placing<00:00:46.840> these

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
advantage of that by placing these

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.750 
advantage of that by placing these
forged<00:00:47.500> hinges<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:48.040> in<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.280> corner<00:00:48.640> where

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
forged hinges here in the corner where

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.889 
forged hinges here in the corner where
there's<00:00:48.910> plenty<00:00:49.149> of<00:00:49.210> strength<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.690> support

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
there's plenty of strength to support

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.990 
there's plenty of strength to support
the<00:00:50.200> weight<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:51.190> this<00:00:51.399> unit<00:00:51.700> is<00:00:51.730> going<00:00:51.880> to

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
the weight that this unit is going to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.150 
the weight that this unit is going to
carry<00:00:52.239> now<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> common<00:00:53.200> complaint<00:00:53.500> with<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
carry now a common complaint with the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.540 
carry now a common complaint with the
tailgate<00:00:54.430> on<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.660> JK<00:00:56.079> is<00:00:56.290> rattles<00:00:56.800> over<00:00:57.280> time

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
tailgate on the JK is rattles over time

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.190 
tailgate on the JK is rattles over time
with<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.940> spare<00:00:58.180> tire<00:00:58.390> bouncing<00:00:58.930> up<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.110> down

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
with the spare tire bouncing up and down

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.319 
with the spare tire bouncing up and down
here<00:00:59.649> now<00:01:00.190> things<00:01:00.460> start<00:01:00.700> to<00:01:00.730> shake<00:01:01.000> loose<00:01:01.180> a

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
here now things start to shake loose a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.610 
here now things start to shake loose a
little<00:01:01.420> bit<00:01:01.630> in<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.750> tailgate<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.290> get<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.469> lot

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
little bit in the tailgate you get a lot

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.109 
little bit in the tailgate you get a lot
of<00:01:02.739> noise<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.250> rattles<00:01:03.579> from<00:01:03.790> it

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
of noise and rattles from it

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.359 
of noise and rattles from it
and<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:04.930> what<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.229> wanted<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.590> do<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.920> transfer

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
and so what we wanted to do is transfer

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.039 
and so what we wanted to do is transfer
the<00:01:06.460> stress<00:01:06.670> away<00:01:07.180> from<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.540> tailgate<00:01:07.960> we

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
the stress away from the tailgate we

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.270 
the stress away from the tailgate we
don't<00:01:08.200> want<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.560> carrying<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.070> tire

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
don't want this carrying the tire

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.490 
don't want this carrying the tire
anymore<00:01:09.760> we<00:01:10.240> developed<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.690> Teraflex<00:01:11.110> hinged

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
anymore we developed the Teraflex hinged

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890 
anymore we developed the Teraflex hinged
carrier<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.640> replace<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.240> tailgate<00:01:13.659> as<00:01:13.870> a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
carrier to replace the tailgate as a

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020 
carrier to replace the tailgate as a
carrying<00:01:14.320> component<00:01:14.890> for<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.580> spare<00:01:15.820> tire

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
carrying component for the spare tire

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.500 
carrying component for the spare tire
and<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.659> gate<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.280> what<00:01:18.490> we<00:01:18.640> wanted<00:01:19.060> here<00:01:19.330> was

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
and the gate so what we wanted here was

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.649 
and the gate so what we wanted here was
a<00:01:19.659> factory<00:01:20.229> look<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:21.549> wanted<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.060> be<00:01:22.180> easy<00:01:22.420> to

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
a factory look we wanted to be easy to

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.690 
a factory look we wanted to be easy to
install<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.530> wanted<00:01:23.830> it<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.950> be<00:01:24.130> simple<00:01:24.610> to

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
install and we wanted it to be simple to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.120 
install and we wanted it to be simple to
operate<00:01:24.729> now<00:01:25.659> one<00:01:25.840> problem<00:01:26.020> people<00:01:26.470> run<00:01:26.619> into

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
operate now one problem people run into

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.090 
operate now one problem people run into
when<00:01:27.430> they<00:01:27.520> go<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.790> larger<00:01:28.180> tire<00:01:28.450> is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
when they go to a larger tire is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.710 
when they go to a larger tire is
oftentimes<00:01:30.100> they<00:01:30.430> change<00:01:30.700> wheels<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.450> they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
oftentimes they change wheels and they

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.359 
oftentimes they change wheels and they
use<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> different<00:01:32.080> back<00:01:32.439> spacing<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.159> what

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
use a different back spacing and what

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.080 
use a different back spacing and what
happens<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:35.290> less<00:01:35.530> backspacing<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
happens is with less backspacing the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.760 
happens is with less backspacing the
tire<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.510> wheel<00:01:37.630> assembly<00:01:37.659> ends<00:01:38.260> up<00:01:38.320> farther

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
tire and wheel assembly ends up farther

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.740 
tire and wheel assembly ends up farther
away<00:01:38.860> from<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.250> tailgate<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:40.390> that's<00:01:40.570> not

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
away from the tailgate now that's not

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.210 
away from the tailgate now that's not
good<00:01:41.020> because<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.439> can<00:01:41.590> see<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
good because you can see that the

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.710 
good because you can see that the
farther<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.729> tire<00:01:42.939> is<00:01:43.210> away<00:01:43.479> from<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
farther the tire is away from the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
farther the tire is away from the
tailgate<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.170> more<00:01:44.350> leverage<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.799> have

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
tailgate the more leverage you have

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.520 
tailgate the more leverage you have
bouncing<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.420> stress<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.869> tailgate<00:01:47.290> and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
bouncing here to stress the tailgate and

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.070 
bouncing here to stress the tailgate and
cause<00:01:48.130> things<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.490> shake<00:01:48.759> loose<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.689> we<00:01:49.720> needed

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
cause things to shake loose so we needed

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.050 
cause things to shake loose so we needed
a<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.350> be<00:01:51.189> able<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.430> adjust<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.880> tire

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
a way to be able to adjust the tire

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.460 
a way to be able to adjust the tire
closer<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> tailgate<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.200> order<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
closer to the tailgate in order to

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.980 
closer to the tailgate in order to
reduce<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.950> stress<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:55.270> assembly<00:01:55.600> here

reduce the stress on this assembly here

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.719 
reduce the stress on this assembly here
so<00:01:56.590> that's<00:01:56.770> where<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.009> came<00:01:57.189> up<00:01:57.250> with<00:01:57.549> this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
so that's where we came up with this

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.539 
so that's where we came up with this
Teraflex<00:01:58.360> adjustable<00:01:58.930> tire<00:01:59.140> mount<00:01:59.500> now<00:02:00.400> what

whichever tire size you're using now if

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.710 
whichever tire size you're using now if
you<00:02:35.320> look<00:02:35.500> closer<00:02:35.800> you'll<00:02:36.250> see<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.480> these

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
you look closer you'll see that these

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.750 
you look closer you'll see that these
this<00:02:38.020> base<00:02:38.260> plate<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> tube<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.190> separate

this base plate and tube is separate

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
this base plate and tube is separate
from<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.510> mount<00:02:40.810> plate<00:02:41.050> right<00:02:41.320> here<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
from this mount plate right here and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.320 
from this mount plate right here and
you've<00:02:42.160> got<00:02:42.310> these<00:02:42.430> pinch<00:02:42.730> bolts<00:02:43.030> right<00:02:43.180> here

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
you've got these pinch bolts right here

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.030 
you've got these pinch bolts right here
that<00:02:43.480> hold<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> two<00:02:43.930> together<00:02:44.080> now<00:02:44.980> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
reason for that is if you use a wheel

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.320 
reason for that is if you use a wheel
with<00:02:47.500> less<00:02:47.710> back<00:02:47.980> spacing<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:49.090> want<00:02:49.240> to

with less back spacing and you want to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.120 
with less back spacing and you want to
suck<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.600> tire<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.140> wheel<00:02:50.260> combo<00:02:50.650> closer<00:02:50.890> to

up hiding your third brake light here by
the<00:03:09.370> tire<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.500> what<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.800> need<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.340> have

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the tire so what you need to do is have

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.949 
the tire so what you need to do is have
a<00:03:12.550> different<00:03:12.880> place<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.090> mount<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.750> third

brake light and so that's why we put

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.420 
brake light and so that's why we put
this<00:03:15.820> here<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.720> way<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.020> works<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:18.130> once
