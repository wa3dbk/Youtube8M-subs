00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.760
 hi girls today I you 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.700
 shows how to make this hairstyle 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.680
 very original perfect for summer is 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.390
 party start with well brushed your 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.279
 hair for this hairstyle it is 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.500
 better to have more or less withdrawal 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.870
 in the middle of your head come take 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.210
 an exotic wick on the front is 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.610
 separated the three-part to start 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.619
 a normal braid so by passing the 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.950
 wick at the back over his life a 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 God 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.690
 then the front one above the one 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.910
 of the mime we will then continue this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.769
 basic truce but every game we 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.379
 will pass over that of the middle 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.600
 we will add a new wick so 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.659
 let's do km which is at the back at 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.870
 Above Samsung have updated a 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:53.050
 beautiful wick takes not that but two 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.489
 years above serious and added 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.260
 also a new wick 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.469
 so this is the principle of the braid 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.690
 African that we will use here and we 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.309
 so always continues the same thing in 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.710
 being careful to tight on each 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.960
 time and directing the braid towards 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 the back of the head once arrived 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.200
 behind the ear continue to train 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.049
 between is this normal 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.810
 right then tied with a rubber band 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.180
 transparent realized exactly the same 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 thing on the other side of your head with 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.469
 the rest of your hair perform a 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.810
 basic braid tied with elastic 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.140
 transparent and so we get a very 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.969
 thick and 13 smaller what will 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.920
 give us a nice asymmetrical braid 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.049
 you have four more tests left 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.789
 the three very dark and if you 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.329
 back on the front to braid more 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.429
 easily 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.859
 do not forget to deal with 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.969
 below and not above since 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.950
 your class is upside down 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.920
 you can now attached with 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.270
 arena titan evening remove the elastic 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.070
 the longest braid 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.409
 and here you have 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.740
 Yes 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.740
