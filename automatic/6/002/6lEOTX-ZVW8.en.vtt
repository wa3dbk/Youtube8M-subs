00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.930

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.829
 plus 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.610
 do not 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 ah 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.470
 for me 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 they put us in a room to manuela and me 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.850
 and tells us that yes indeed you 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 they have found water what has to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 has an address on the in the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.750
 chromosome 22 you are assimilating to and you are 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.450
 in the car you sit in the car 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.940
 you go home and you do not know what to think and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.820
 that this is a syndrome that is called 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.590
 phelan mattern then Manuel and I 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.720
 we look with saying that you're 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.820
 sending that is this in general 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.610
 you can from development delay 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.009
 mental retardation speech alterations 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.319
 or in the language many times 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.069
 this syndrome is poorly 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.069
 diagnostic 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.189
 when you get to a neurologist you tell me 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.509
 what your son has and he says he does not 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.700
 have no idea what you are 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.369
 talking about those after this is going to be 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.119
 rather more complicated than what already 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.119
 in case it seemed 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.659
 this syndrome what you have is lack of 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.159
 diagnosis there are many 22 that grows by 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.290
 there are scattered but not even 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.780
 They know they are not the first blow 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.380
 very hard and very hard the day that you 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.650
 they say 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.160
 you're lost 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.960
 for us it was a relief line 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.270
 I have nothing I do not have where to turn 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.950
 I have to do what I do is something new 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.120
 totally no matter how much the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.400
 people who understand what you are 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 going on they are not able to know what 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.960
 you are happening, you have one thing, it is hard 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.460
 it is hard woman has told him in several 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.650
 occasions that if not a shame 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.989
 take it out of the house 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.299
 the people are very curious he is 3 years old and 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.890
 they have not yet data we do not have to give 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.230
 we have to integrate ourselves into the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.569
 society not what horror 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.489
 children will never always give you the 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.830
 note at the end everything translates into money 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.349
 if you do not have money these children do not 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.840
 they can have an attention like them 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.760
 requires is a laboratory that can 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.599
 have a benefit will investigate if not 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.530
 you can go down 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.290
 things 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.459
 playable support sans 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.459
 fit 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.360
 the future 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.450
 with uncertainty great uncertainty 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.180
 forget about the future because it's like a 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.800
 abyss is like a precipice that you get 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.590
 very much my vessel glass 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.230
 badly done now I am young I now have 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.090
 I can take care of my son 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.090
 but when I am older
