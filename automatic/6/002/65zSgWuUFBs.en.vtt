 the car once they have it all there 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:53.539
 is that they do not care for the beautiful minister 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:05:00.289
 probably and the protocol they have there car 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:03.620
 lying in the front seat card 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.449
 route so you have an order on 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.580

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:41.529

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:13.250
 rights to warn decided to make about 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.960
