00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.700
 if the cumbia maya brother group is 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.370
 It was a trip because they took their suitcases 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.709
 and in group in spot they went to 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.480
 sing to the Peruvian compatriots they 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.220
 they went through the streets of santiago 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.750
 they found a lot of people you know that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 in these holidays because also not 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.720
 they only give but we go to school not 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.689
 more and what I love is that they prepare 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.220
 the Peruvian food a lomo saltado and in 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.650
 chile because it is that the gastronomy 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.140

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.379
 Chilean restaurants are of course 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.719

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.350
