00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 angle radar and camera supported 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 He warns the truck driver when turning 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 in front of pedestrians cyclists and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.930
 obstacles in the dead angle 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.180
 are located 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 The driver becomes visually and acoustically 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 the blind spot warned it is under surveillance 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.539

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.440
 spurwechsel 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.500
 minute 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.510
 a special sight in the shadow of the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.640
 BMW teams in Munich are equal to 7507 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.500
 in front of the entrance of the bmw museum the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 roadster varieties are not without 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.300
 Reason for the red carpet traveled in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.730
 museum held annually saar place at 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.270
 another 507 back in Munich too 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.270
 welcome 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.490
 the car was really exceptional 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.320
 especially for bmw it was sensational 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 The car has an aluminum body 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.050
 a very rare story at that time and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.660
 It also has a V8 engine full hall 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.360
 that did not exist, it was the first 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.570
 worldwide all-aluminum and that gave good 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.080
 excellent performance of the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.300
 cars 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.530
 So it was really a chance for Tim 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 Today is the retrospective arrival of the red 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.929
 For a long time he was without America 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.370
 Care and exit was from the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.590
 former eye catcher quickly 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580
 run-down dust collector long 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.770
 time unnoticed 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.870
 at the introduction to the museum was 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.040
 However, the clear announcement in his 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.050
 condition 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.459
 with the utmost caution, even the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.459
 protected dust layers 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.270
 we have this day long 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.120
 it worked very long 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.230
 For years we have with the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.590
 owner spoken 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.660
 and today is the day where we have this 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.070
 unrestored vehicle here 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.110
 public can show with the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.720
 clear order for the Lord castor 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.780
 includes back into the original state 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 to convey a condition 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.190
 well and good but why is a 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.350
 Oldtimer in such a restored 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.440
 condition in a special exhibition 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.250
 which story has this bmw probably 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.250
 tell 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.420
 it is one of 254 built bmw 507 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.520
 and we have something very special here 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.460
 the vehicle was shown once 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.290
 that the iaa as a exhibition vehicle 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.350
 then it was used further as 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.240
 haul stuck for hans and then 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.010
 after the revision in the factory is 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.820
 sold an elvis presley 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.690
 because the vehicle is after the elvis 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.920
 has gone back into the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.210
 united states and the age 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.290
 probably took that with it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.630
 not proven that he always taken 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.780
 but it is believed that he is in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.720
 Alabama surfaced because private individuals 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.330
 from there he was then at checa store 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.690
 sold and he has him then one 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.370
 bit used as a driver 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.280
 elvis presley the king of rock'n roll 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.080
 pure so this 507 will be his time 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.300
 than ever in germany 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.790
 as once the owner will now too 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.290
 his dare to the motive of many photos of the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.360
 red lacquer is unfortunately no longer the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.550
 Elvis the freshest left the car then 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 Red paint ball worshipers on the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.420
 white paint always with red lipstick 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.880
 their telephone numbers left 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.459
 The current state of the car is outside 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.459
 like inside more than in need of care 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.550
 Hard to believe that behind this 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.190
 White steering wheel once the king of rock'n 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.120
 Roll space took the vehicle completely 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.570
 is decomposed 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.070
 Then the aluminum will be connected 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.900
 expire the state underbody 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.170
 then the group will be removed 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.090
 state underbody group in the roof 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.960
 elicit and what is left then 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.670
 of which we will construct it after 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 there are no parts left sooner yes 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.800
 the outer skin over wood models commemorates 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.480
 after we have several vehicles already 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.170
 connects plastic have been restored 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.940
 we have created plastic men 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.720
 and then over the heads you then the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.720
 everyone has outside 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.949
 But first of all, it will be authentic with the music 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.930
 the kings celebrated a lot of time 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.210
 However, bmw classic does not have one 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.620
 set a tight target and who the 507th 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.760
 complete within two years 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.550
 restore 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.830
 but what happens when the roadster is in 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.370
 it shines as old 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.580
 the permanent loan of the wood museum remains 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.970
 castor has moved to it 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.770
 this car every public 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.590
 that's a clear one 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.510
 provided with its name, it is therefore 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.580
 clearly he did this, they continue to 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.580
 will be located the his possession 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.670
 not only the proud owner but 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.700
 Visitors to the bmw museum can do it too 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.930
 hardly expect the 507 in new splendor 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.930
 to shine
