we've<00:01:03.350> made<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.829> regular<00:01:04.189> 90<00:01:04.820> degree<00:01:05.119> outside

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
we've made a regular 90 degree outside

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.020 
we've made a regular 90 degree outside
corner<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.210> have<00:01:08.390> two<00:01:08.869> sides<00:01:09.820> upper<00:01:10.820> back

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
corner so we have two sides upper back

corner so we have two sides upper back
to<00:01:11.210> back<00:01:11.390> corner<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.139> we<00:01:12.259> need<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.560> make<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
to back corner and we need to make the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.870 
to back corner and we need to make the
centerpiece<00:01:13.399> now<00:01:14.560> what<00:01:15.560> we'll<00:01:15.740> do<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.639> we'll

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
centerpiece now what we'll do is we'll

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.120 
centerpiece now what we'll do is we'll
measure<00:01:17.740> our<00:01:18.740> measurement<00:01:19.249> on<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> wall<00:01:21.130> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
measure our measurement on the wall and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.149 
measure our measurement on the wall and
we'll<00:01:22.310> get<00:01:22.429> our<00:01:22.549> third<00:01:22.850> piece<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.299> molding<00:01:24.159> and

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
we'll get our third piece of molding and

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.269 
we'll get our third piece of molding and
we'll<00:01:25.310> put<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.579> in<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.759> song<00:01:26.709> with<00:01:27.709> the<00:01:27.799> top<00:01:28.039> up

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:28.279 
we'll put it in the song with the top up

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:35.459 
we'll put it in the song with the top up
and<00:01:28.459> this<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:28.969> toward<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.389> floor<00:01:29.630> make<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.439> cut

right<00:01:41.329> here<00:01:41.479> at<00:01:41.599> the<00:01:41.689> top<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.590> what<00:01:42.740> we're

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
right here at the top and what we're

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.139 
right here at the top and what we're
going<00:01:43.069> to<00:01:43.099> do<00:01:43.279> is<00:01:43.639> we're<00:01:43.759> going<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:43.969> measure

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
going to do is we're going to measure

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:52.359 
going to do is we're going to measure
over<00:01:45.939> distance<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.179> just<00:01:47.420> measured<00:01:51.369> in

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
over distance that we just measured in

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.319 
over distance that we just measured in
there<00:01:52.880> mark<00:01:54.429> and<00:01:55.429> what<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:55.609> usually<00:01:55.849> do<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.179> put

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
there mark and what I usually do is put

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.870 
there mark and what I usually do is put
a<00:01:56.359> mark<00:01:56.659> on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.409> top<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.039> makes<00:01:58.099> very<00:01:58.459> easy<00:01:58.609> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a mark on the top it makes very easy to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.519 
a mark on the top it makes very easy to
see<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:01.909> put<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.270> toward<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:03.259> will<00:02:03.439> be

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
see you put this toward this will be

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.899 
see you put this toward this will be
toward<00:02:03.829> your<00:02:03.950> ceiling<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.579> this<00:02:04.700> would<00:02:04.819> be

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
toward your ceiling and this would be

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.179 
toward your ceiling and this would be
toward<00:02:05.209> your<00:02:05.359> floor<00:02:05.630> right<00:02:06.289> back<00:02:06.619> up<00:02:06.799> against

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
your saw bring the leg down to the line

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
your saw bring the leg down to the line
let<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.500> mark

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.380 

and<00:02:19.050> now<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.460> made<00:02:21.610> all<00:02:21.850> three<00:02:22.030> pieces

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and now you have made all three pieces

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.350 
and now you have made all three pieces
of<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:25.000> back<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.420> back<00:02:25.600> corner<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.150> very
