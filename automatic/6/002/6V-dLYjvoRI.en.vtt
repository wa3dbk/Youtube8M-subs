00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
help the horses that have what I call a

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.700 
help the horses that have what I call a
shorter<00:00:32.430> smile<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.930> very<00:00:34.140> common<00:00:34.559> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
shorter smile and it's very common it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
shorter smile and it's very common it's
very<00:00:34.890> common<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.579> our<00:00:35.700> warm<00:00:36.059> Bloods<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
very common with our warm Bloods of a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.260 
very common with our warm Bloods of a
youth<00:00:36.809> predominantly<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.770> dressage<00:00:38.270> now

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
youth predominantly for dressage now

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.500 
youth predominantly for dressage now
when<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> say<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> short<00:00:40.829> smile<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> mean<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
when I say a short smile what I mean is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.440 
when I say a short smile what I mean is
short<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.950> corner<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> lip<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
short from the corner of the lip to the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
short from the corner of the lip to the
muzzle<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.600> anatomically<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:49.520> very

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
muzzle and it is anatomically very very

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
muzzle and it is anatomically very very
common<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.030> I'll<00:00:51.180> say<00:00:51.390> especially<00:00:52.290> with<00:00:52.740> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
common as I'll say especially with the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.350 
common as I'll say especially with the
Dutch<00:00:53.010> horses<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.140> when<00:00:55.140> we're<00:00:55.350> actually

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
Dutch horses and when we're actually

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
Dutch horses and when we're actually
fitting<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.720> doubles<00:00:58.250> we<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> ensure

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
fitting the doubles we want to ensure

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.200 
fitting the doubles we want to ensure
that<00:01:00.150> because<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.290> short<00:01:01.560> smile<00:01:02.210> they

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that because of this short smile they

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
that because of this short smile they
stay<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.930> far<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> mouth<00:01:05.369> as

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
stay as far back in the mouth as

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.850 
stay as far back in the mouth as
possible

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
possible

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
possible
because<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.009> want<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.939> sit

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because we want them to actually sit

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929 
because we want them to actually sit
over<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> thicker<00:01:10.530> less<00:01:11.040> sensitive<00:01:11.520> part<00:01:11.790> of

over a thicker less sensitive part of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.050 
over a thicker less sensitive part of
the<00:01:12.000> tongue<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:13.110> they're<00:01:13.920> situated<00:01:14.399> too<00:01:14.790> far

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the tongue if they're situated too far

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.780 
the tongue if they're situated too far
forward<00:01:15.390> within<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.290> mouth<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.640> would

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
forward within the mouth then it would

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
forward within the mouth then it would
ever<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> horse<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> thinner

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
ever take the horse it's on a thinner

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
ever take the horse it's on a thinner
much<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:19.979> sensitive<00:01:20.369> part<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.999> tongue

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
much more sensitive part of the tongue

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.879 
much more sensitive part of the tongue
it<00:01:21.359> would<00:01:21.479> irritate<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.049> horse<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.740> horse

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
it would irritate the horse the horse

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.160 
it would irritate the horse the horse
will<00:01:23.130> become<00:01:23.399> overactive<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.569> mouth<00:01:24.749> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
will become overactive in the mouth and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.349 
will become overactive in the mouth and
the<00:01:25.649> horse<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.219> ultimately<00:01:26.759> learn<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.179> draw

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
the horse will ultimately learn to draw

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.139 
the horse will ultimately learn to draw
the<00:01:27.420> tongue<00:01:27.749> back<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.319> possibly<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
the tongue back and possibly get the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.999 
the tongue back and possibly get the
term<00:01:30.389> over<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.659> top<00:01:30.990> there'll<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:31.979> more

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
term over the top there'll be a lot more

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.949 
term over the top there'll be a lot more
space<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.819> horse<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.569> achieve

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
space for the horse to actually achieve

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.539 
space for the horse to actually achieve
this<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.740> bits<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.219> be<00:01:35.249> sat

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this because the bits will be sat

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
this because the bits will be sat
further<00:01:35.819> forwards<00:01:36.359> now<00:01:37.259> nobody<00:01:37.590> has<00:01:37.799> actually

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
further forwards now nobody has actually

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.539 
further forwards now nobody has actually
done<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.909> before<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.770> our<00:01:40.770> field<00:01:41.069> trials

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
done this before and our field trials

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.169 
done this before and our field trials
have<00:01:41.789> been<00:01:42.030> hugely<00:01:42.569> successful<00:01:43.109> for

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
have been hugely successful for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.609 
have been hugely successful for
combating<00:01:45.179> this<00:01:45.479> particular<00:01:45.929> problem

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
combating this particular problem

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.849 
combating this particular problem
through<00:01:47.219> discomfort<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.779> it's<00:01:49.529> actually

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
through discomfort because it's actually

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.889 
through discomfort because it's actually
the<00:01:50.369> mouthpiece<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.999> actually<00:01:51.389> set<00:01:51.659> on

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the mouthpiece is actually set on

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.999 
the mouthpiece is actually set on
backwards<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:53.130> 45<00:01:53.909> degrees<00:01:54.499> now<00:01:55.499> what<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
backwards at 45 degrees now what this

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.730 
backwards at 45 degrees now what this
does<00:01:56.069> is<00:01:56.340> basically<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.349> employ<00:01:58.709> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
does is basically when we employ the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.609 
does is basically when we employ the
curb<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:01.499> curb<00:02:01.770> acts<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.749> it<00:02:03.749> lifts<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
curb and the curb acts and it lifts and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.960 
curb and the curb acts and it lifts and
it<00:02:05.219> turns<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:06.420> mouthpiece<00:02:07.049> isn't<00:02:07.590> traveling

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
it turns the mouthpiece isn't traveling

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.370 
it turns the mouthpiece isn't traveling
forwards<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.509> sitting<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:10.140> much

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
forwards it's actually sitting much much

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.589 
forwards it's actually sitting much much
further<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.340> within<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.240> horse's

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
further back and within the horse's

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.520 
further back and within the horse's
mouth<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:14.190> actually<00:02:14.840> more<00:02:15.840> comfy<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
mouth so it's actually more comfy and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010 
mouth so it's actually more comfy and
it's<00:02:16.980> giving<00:02:17.520> us<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:17.819> space<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.510> accommodate

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's giving us more space to accommodate

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's giving us more space to accommodate
the<00:02:19.170> per<00:02:19.290> dune<00:02:19.470> as<00:02:19.920> well<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.690> very<00:02:22.110> very

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the per dune as well so it's very very

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.440 
the per dune as well so it's very very
clever<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:24.420> proven<00:02:25.290> hugely<00:02:25.920> successful

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
clever and it's proven hugely successful

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.640 
clever and it's proven hugely successful
so<00:02:27.450> even<00:02:28.049> if<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> haven't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
so even if you haven't

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.710 
so even if you haven't
got<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.010> short<00:02:29.280> smile<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:30.000> you've<00:02:30.420> got<00:02:30.689> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
got the short smile if you've got a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.890
