waves<00:04:02.000> would<00:04:02.269> form<00:04:02.569> on<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> airplane<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.230> it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
waves would form on the airplane and it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.680 
waves would form on the airplane and it

would buffett and become uncontrollable

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.589 
would buffett and become uncontrollable
under<00:04:06.440> certain<00:04:06.650> conditions<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.000> big<00:04:08.299> thing

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
under certain conditions the big thing

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.509 
under certain conditions the big thing
that<00:04:08.630> came<00:04:08.959> out<00:04:09.019> of<00:04:09.169> the<00:04:09.349> whole<00:04:09.500> x1<00:04:10.040> program

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
that came out of the whole x1 program

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.550 
that came out of the whole x1 program
and<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:10.760> took<00:04:10.970> me<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.329> 92<00:04:11.810> days<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.290> get<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
and it took me in 92 days to get the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.240 
and it took me in 92 days to get the
airplane<00:04:12.799> above<00:04:13.489> Mach<00:04:13.940> 1<00:04:14.209> was<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:15.380> we<00:04:15.680> had<00:04:15.709> to
