 golazo of Carlos Escobar on the format programs delivered more than 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:30.770
 budgeted 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.770
 the teams of this entity z series 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.770
 now I'm going to present the view and the 6100 that the highest machine 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700
 productivity and greater speed in the market 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.450
 we can say that the six militiamen that result of experience 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 acquired from the launch of the fp trade show 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.360
 It is available in two configurations 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.010
 42 and 60 inches 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.260
 the z 6102 the memory of the 196 megabytes expandable up to 512 and a hard disk of 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 40 days 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.300
 the operation of the equipment is very simple all the procedures that are 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.070
 clearly described in the control panel 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.820
 the teacher would attack me paper is very simple 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.180
 we enter paper retail 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.930
 we select the paper loading option 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.260
 each roll 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.370
 and the machine we started the instructions 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 we open the window 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.280
 we lift the south lever 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 and we are going to feed the paper to the level of the stage 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.040
 as for the machine it detects the material 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 begins to work knee 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.980
 we have to dress the material 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 to the blue guide 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 we lower the lever 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.619
 removed mocel exelente 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
 and we close the door 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.669
 the selection of the material is very important 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.339
 we select the material option 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.339
 the type of material that we are using 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.029
 and the manufacturer's specification 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.649
 we can select the length of the flight for the machine to keep 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.649
 memory the remaining link of the roll 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.339
 the cable cartridges summer simple mind 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.849
 the machine tells us with a cartridge has little paint because the plan is not 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.189
 completed 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.189
 in this case we are approaching the ribbon matt leblanc 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
 the very extensive cartridge cable simply 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.039
 you have to go sat
