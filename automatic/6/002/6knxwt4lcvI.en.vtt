00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.540 
which are fine on Travis here so I'm
just<00:01:45.470> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.650> work<00:01:45.800> histories<00:01:46.280> from

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
just going to work histories from

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.469 
just going to work histories from
studies<00:01:48.610> obviously<00:01:49.610> most<00:01:49.880> important<00:01:50.360> for

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
studies obviously most important for

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.359 
studies obviously most important for
work<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.720> itself<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.440> very<00:01:51.619> repair<00:01:51.920> why<00:01:52.190> of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
work in itself is a very repair why of

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.430 
work in itself is a very repair why of
course<00:01:52.400> it's<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.630> inside<00:01:53.930> here<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.410> some

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
course it's so inside here I have some

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.920 
course it's so inside here I have some
goals<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.220> some<00:01:55.340> leaves<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.820> this<00:01:56.720> design

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
goals I have some leaves and this design

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.260 
goals I have some leaves and this design
is<00:01:57.080> one<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.410> expenses<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.640> if<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.090> made<00:01:59.240> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
is one of expenses that if you made it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.700 
is one of expenses that if you made it
with<00:01:59.450> fresh<00:01:59.690> France<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.350> would<00:02:00.470> have<00:02:00.560> liked

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
with fresh France you would have liked

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.350 
with fresh France you would have liked
small<00:02:00.950> test<00:02:01.190> tubes<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.240> would

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
small test tubes in here and you would

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.670 
small test tubes in here and you would
then<00:02:02.509> only<00:02:02.690> need<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.990> really<00:02:03.200> replace<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
then only need to really replace the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.080 
then only need to really replace the
flowers<00:02:04.070> though<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.490> best<00:02:04.640> way<00:02:04.790> with<00:02:04.940> any

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
flowers though the best way with any

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.639 
flowers though the best way with any
structure<00:02:05.539> is<00:02:05.720> make<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.050> structures<00:02:06.380> spend

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
structure is make the structures spend

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.020 
structure is make the structures spend
the<00:02:06.740> time<00:02:06.890> eight<00:02:07.070> make<00:02:07.460> sure<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.670> looks<00:02:07.729> good

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the time eight make sure it looks good

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.479 
the time eight make sure it looks good
and<00:02:08.360> then<00:02:08.869> lots<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.380> flowers<00:02:09.619> pass<00:02:09.800> away<00:02:09.920> you

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and then lots of flowers pass away you

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.979 
and then lots of flowers pass away you
can<00:02:10.670> add<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.209> bit<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.780> fresh

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
can add a little bit we can have fresh

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.780 
can add a little bit we can have fresh
110<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.560> reuse<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> structure<00:02:13.340> which<00:02:13.700> i

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
110 and reuse the structure which i

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.080 
110 and reuse the structure which i
think<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.030> always<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> good<00:02:15.080> thing<00:02:15.910> i'm<00:02:16.910> also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
think is always a good thing i'm also

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.570 
think is always a good thing i'm also
using<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.600> real<00:02:18.260> why<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.980> kind<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.250> read

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
using the real why here to kind of read

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.460 
using the real why here to kind of read
the<00:02:19.730> material<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.270> between<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> keep<00:02:21.320> it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the material in between just to keep it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.620 
the material in between just to keep it
in<00:02:21.530> place<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:22.040> also<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> kind<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.209> bring<00:02:23.390> this

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
in place and also to kind of bring this

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.810 
in place and also to kind of bring this
out<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.200> cook<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.410> over<00:02:24.680> but<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.190> pieces<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
out and cook it over but the pieces of a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.000 
out and cook it over but the pieces of a
material<00:02:26.510> including<00:02:27.080> end<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.799> great

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
material including end it's just a great

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.089 
material including end it's just a great
using<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.610> actual<00:02:28.880> structure<00:02:29.269> mechanic

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
using the actual structure mechanic

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.089 
using the actual structure mechanic
there's<00:02:32.099> no<00:02:32.190> phones<00:02:32.670> no<00:02:32.930> no<00:02:33.930> variable<00:02:34.560> it's

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
there's no phones no no variable it's

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.410 
there's no phones no no variable it's
kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> literally<00:02:35.760> place<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.209> tell

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
kind of literally place to tell

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.580 
kind of literally place to tell
structure<00:02:36.750> was<00:02:37.019> probably<00:02:37.319> like<00:02:37.470> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
structure was probably like this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.309 
structure was probably like this
arrangement<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.190> pretty<00:02:38.459> much<00:02:38.640> finished<00:02:39.319> as

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
arrangement is pretty much finished as

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.610 
arrangement is pretty much finished as
you<00:02:40.470> saw<00:02:40.620> me<00:02:40.799> very<00:02:41.549> very<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.239> maybe

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
you saw me very very good to do maybe

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.750 
you saw me very very good to do maybe
10-15<00:02:43.620> minutes<00:02:43.890> she's<00:02:44.129> actually<00:02:44.280> put<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
10-15 minutes she's actually put in the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.789 
10-15 minutes she's actually put in the
flour<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:45.209> very<00:02:45.480> very<00:02:45.569> simple<00:02:45.959> very<00:02:46.260> pretty

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
flour in very very simple very pretty

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.330 
flour in very very simple very pretty
and<00:02:47.150> once<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.420> flowers<00:02:48.810> passed<00:02:49.200> away<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:50.190> can

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and once the flowers passed away you can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.200 
and once the flowers passed away you can
always<00:02:50.489> add<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:50.910> fresh<00:02:51.330> thank<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.019> very<00:02:52.049> much
