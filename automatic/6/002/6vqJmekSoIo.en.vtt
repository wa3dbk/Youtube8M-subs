weekend is closing in on this upper band

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.819 
weekend is closing in on this upper band
this<00:00:49.500> upper<00:00:49.800> band<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.210> 1743<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:52.260> gives<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this upper band is 1743 that gives it a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
this upper band is 1743 that gives it a
little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> room<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.570> goes

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
little bit of room in it as it goes

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.229 
little bit of room in it as it goes
higher<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> band<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.860> slowly<00:00:56.399> increases

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
higher the band would slowly increases

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
higher the band would slowly increases
well<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.870> maybe<00:00:58.199> roughly<00:00:58.739> around<00:00:58.920> 17<00:01:00.230> 45<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
well so maybe roughly around 17 45 or so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
well so maybe roughly around 17 45 or so
as<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.969> area<00:01:03.359> where<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
as an area where it would come up to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.730 
as an area where it would come up to
this<00:01:04.739> level<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> comes<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this level when it comes up to that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
this level when it comes up to that
level<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.700> where<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.510> looking<00:01:09.990> for

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
possibility and maybe there's a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
possibility and maybe there's a
situation<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.069> stocks<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.759> and

situation where stocks and go up and
gold<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.330> down<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:09.869> gold<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
gold to go down because gold is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.870 
gold to go down because gold is
overextended<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.280> difficult

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
overextended it's really difficult

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.330 
overextended it's really difficult
see<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:12.840> what's<00:02:13.050> easy<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.800> how<00:02:13.980> Gold's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
see but what's easy to see is how Gold's

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.270 
see but what's easy to see is how Gold's
in<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.490> superior<00:02:14.850> uptrend<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.770> there's<00:02:16.770> no

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
in a superior uptrend and there's no

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.560 
in a superior uptrend and there's no
signs<00:02:17.700> whatsoever<00:02:18.120> about<00:02:19.460> calling<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.580> top<00:02:20.850> now

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570

as<00:02:21.720> far<00:02:21.930> as<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.110> trend<00:02:22.500> line<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> concerned<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
as far as a trend line is concerned I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.660 
as far as a trend line is concerned I
think<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:23.970> important<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> note<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.320> has

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
think it's important to note that it has

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
think it's important to note that it has
broken<00:02:26.670> above<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.660> significant<00:02:28.500> trend<00:02:28.770> line

broken above this significant trend line

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.820 
broken above this significant trend line
which<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.280> often<00:02:29.550> times<00:02:30.150> cause<00:02:30.720> increased<00:02:31.590> of

which can often times cause increased of
volatility<00:02:32.580> we'll<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.380> ends<00:02:34.920> up

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430 
volatility we'll see how this ends up
playing<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.840> definitely<00:02:37.050> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
playing out but it is definitely a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.650 
playing out but it is definitely a

that<00:02:46.080> tells<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.770> overextended

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.570

we're seeing gold at 25 2600 it's a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
possibility because when it goes

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.530 
possibility because when it goes
parabolic<00:03:09.990> or<00:03:10.200> when<00:03:10.380> volatility<00:03:11.100> increases

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
parabolic or when volatility increases

parabolic or when volatility increases
more<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.780> follow<00:03:12.810> making<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.560> easier<00:03:14.040> for

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
more will follow making it easier for

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.880 
more will follow making it easier for
those<00:03:14.340> major<00:03:14.730> gains<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.420> 3%<00:03:15.780> add<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.200> kind<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.680> us

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
those major gains of 3% add a kind of us

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.510 
those major gains of 3% add a kind of us
situations<00:03:18.080> okay<00:03:19.080> let's<00:03:19.620> see<00:03:19.950> what<00:03:20.160> else<00:03:20.340> do

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
situations okay let's see what else do

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.630 
situations okay let's see what else do
we<00:03:20.550> have<00:03:21.290> already<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.500> have<00:03:22.530> silver<00:03:23.040> here

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
we have already we have silver here

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.760 
we have already we have silver here
which<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.120> down<00:03:24.420> from<00:03:24.450> its<00:03:24.840> lows<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.530> about

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
which is down from its lows of about

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.950 
which is down from its lows of about
forty<00:03:26.070> nine<00:03:26.220> dollars<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:27.000> eighty<00:03:27.300> cents

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
forty nine dollars and eighty cents

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.330 
forty nine dollars and eighty cents
therefore<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.520> down<00:03:29.820> about<00:03:30.260> twenty<00:03:31.260> percent

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
therefore it's down about twenty percent

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.570 
therefore it's down about twenty percent
and<00:03:32.480> ironically<00:03:33.480> enough<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.980> Dow

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
and ironically enough so is the Dow

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.860 
and ironically enough so is the Dow
Jones<00:03:35.610> from<00:03:36.090> its<00:03:36.240> high<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> more

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
Jones from its high but it's a more

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.570 
Jones from its high but it's a more
volatile<00:03:37.290> situation<00:03:38.070> where<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> stock

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
volatile situation where the stock

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
that point I'm gonna put up a trendline

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.100 
that point I'm gonna put up a trendline
the<00:03:51.330> one<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.690> was<00:03:51.870> following<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.800> quite<00:03:53.700> a

the one that I was following for quite a

the one that I was following for quite a
decent<00:03:55.110> amount

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.820 

this<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.510> here<00:04:00.670> now<00:04:01.670> what's<00:04:02.060> happened<00:04:02.599> is

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
this one in here now what's happened is

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.160 
this one in here now what's happened is
this<00:04:03.830> level<00:04:04.340> has<00:04:04.730> found<00:04:05.330> resistance<00:04:05.900> in<00:04:06.020> this

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
this level has found resistance in this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.110 
this level has found resistance in this
area<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.530> think<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.010> would<00:04:07.130> be<00:04:07.160> easier<00:04:07.730> if<00:04:07.760> I

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
area I think it would be easier if I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.470 
area I think it would be easier if I
give<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.900> short<00:04:09.200> review<00:04:09.940> okay<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.000> here<00:04:11.330> we

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
give you a short review okay so here we

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.960 
give you a short review okay so here we
go<00:04:11.510> we<00:04:11.870> got<00:04:12.050> this<00:04:12.410> same<00:04:13.160> charge<00:04:13.489> us<00:04:13.700> less

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
go we got this same charge us less

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.409 
go we got this same charge us less
periods<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.549> this<00:04:16.549> was<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.790> brilliant

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
periods and this was a brilliant

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.150 
periods and this was a brilliant
trendline<00:04:18.079> all<00:04:18.230> it<00:04:18.410> did<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.739> start<00:04:19.010> with

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
trendline all it did to start with

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.129 
trendline all it did to start with
connect<00:04:19.459> this<00:04:19.579> in<00:04:19.790> this<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.209> was<00:04:20.389> it<00:04:20.540> but

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
connect this in this that was it but

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.040 
connect this in this that was it but
since<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:22.070> connected<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.760> point<00:04:23.060> found

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
since it connected that point found

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.860 
since it connected that point found
perfect<00:04:24.500> support<00:04:24.919> support<00:04:25.250> support<00:04:25.870> broke

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
perfect support support support broke

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.750 
perfect support support support broke
below<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.010> found<00:04:28.160> resistance

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
below it in here and found resistance

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.870 
below it in here and found resistance
okay<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.650> what's<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.040> parallel<00:04:31.460> line<00:04:31.639> well<00:04:31.850> I

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
okay so what's the parallel line well I

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.090 
okay so what's the parallel line well I
do<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.210> exact<00:04:32.540> same<00:04:32.690> rate<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.530> ascent<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
do the exact same rate of ascent and

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.879 
do the exact same rate of ascent and
it's<00:04:34.310> by<00:04:34.850> doing<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.510> i<00:04:35.540> can<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:35.990> merely<00:04:36.440> draw

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
it's by doing so i can just merely draw

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.879 
it's by doing so i can just merely draw
over<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.490> line<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.000> then<00:04:38.990> move<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.560> lower

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
over the line and then move this lower

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.770 
over the line and then move this lower
find<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> best<00:04:40.580> point<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.120> point<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.510> i<00:04:41.570> was

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
find the best point the point that i was

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.219 
find the best point the point that i was
using<00:04:42.080> was<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.010> one<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.430> connected<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
using was the one that connected the

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.280 
using was the one that connected the
kilos<00:04:45.229> like<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.100> like<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> did<00:04:46.729> in<00:04:46.760> here<00:04:47.290> okay

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
kilos like the like it did in here okay

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.280 
kilos like the like it did in here okay
so<00:04:48.729> obviously<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:50.210> fell<00:04:50.450> below<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:51.020> line

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
so obviously it fell below this line

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.760 
so obviously it fell below this line
it's<00:04:51.680> finding<00:04:52.130> resistance<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.500> do

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
it's finding resistance and we can do

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.110 
it's finding resistance and we can do
another<00:04:55.280> calculated<00:04:56.150> move<00:04:56.419> by<00:04:56.780> taking<00:04:58.120> this

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
another calculated move by taking this

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.950 
another calculated move by taking this
the<00:04:59.720> same<00:05:00.710> range<00:05:01.250> match<00:05:01.880> it<00:05:02.210> somewhere<00:05:02.720> along

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
the same range match it somewhere along

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.219 
the same range match it somewhere along
here<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:04.570> simple<00:05:05.570> copy<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.289> paste<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.919> then

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
here a simple copy and paste and then

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.900 
here a simple copy and paste and then
dramatic<00:05:09.229> another<00:05:09.470> line<00:05:12.340> that's<00:05:13.340> not<00:05:13.760> the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
dramatic another line that's not the

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.690 
dramatic another line that's not the
best<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.300> matches<00:05:16.210> that's<00:05:17.210> good<00:05:17.539> one<00:05:17.690> and

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
best of matches that's good one and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.180 
best of matches that's good one and
notice<00:05:19.700> how<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.210> found<00:05:20.780> support<00:05:21.500> pretty<00:05:21.950> much

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
notice how it found support pretty much

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.550 
notice how it found support pretty much
precisely<00:05:22.970> within<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.750> level<00:05:24.110> but<00:05:24.320> came

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
precisely within the level but came

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.810 
precisely within the level but came
right<00:05:24.919> back<00:05:25.190> in<00:05:26.050> towards<00:05:27.050> here<00:05:27.650> if<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.520> breaks

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
right back in towards here if it breaks

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.240 
right back in towards here if it breaks
below<00:05:29.210> this<00:05:29.570> trend<00:05:29.990> line<00:05:30.229> I<00:05:30.500> would<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:31.039> I

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
below this trend line I would be I

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.880 
below this trend line I would be I
getting<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.510> little<00:05:32.750> more<00:05:33.080> cautious<00:05:33.380> but<00:05:33.770> at

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
getting a little more cautious but at

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.800 
getting a little more cautious but at
the<00:05:34.010> same<00:05:34.250> point<00:05:34.640> if<00:05:34.880> it<00:05:35.030> does<00:05:35.270> break<00:05:35.570> below

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
the same point if it does break below

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.110 
the same point if it does break below
this<00:05:35.990> we<00:05:36.410> see<00:05:36.590> another<00:05:36.680> down<00:05:37.250> day<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.700> stocks

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
this we see another down day in stocks

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.590 
this we see another down day in stocks
then<00:05:38.690> maybe<00:05:39.650> will<00:05:40.280> participate<00:05:41.060> at<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.510> end

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
then maybe will participate at the end

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330 
then maybe will participate at the end
of<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.750> week<00:05:41.930> like<00:05:42.169> it<00:05:42.320> did<00:05:42.470> last<00:05:42.500> week<00:05:43.039> last

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
of the week like it did last week last

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.730 
of the week like it did last week last
week<00:05:43.550> silver<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.390> gold<00:05:45.110> went<00:05:45.380> out<00:05:45.470> with<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
week silver and gold went out with the

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.230 
week silver and gold went out with the
stock<00:05:45.979> market<00:05:46.310> going<00:05:46.460> down<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.030> all<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.180> a

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
stock market going down and all of a

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.120 
stock market going down and all of a
sudden<00:05:47.570> silver<00:05:48.229> went<00:05:48.410> down<00:05:48.530> with<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:48.770> starch

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
sudden silver went down with the starch

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.010 
sudden silver went down with the starch
maybe<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.729> can<00:05:49.850> happen<00:05:50.030> again<00:05:50.479> break<00:05:50.750> that

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
maybe that can happen again break that

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.719 
maybe that can happen again break that
line<00:05:51.200> and<00:05:51.470> then<00:05:52.070> when<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.460> stock<00:05:52.700> market

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
line and then when the stock market

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.730 
line and then when the stock market
bottomed<00:05:53.270> silver<00:05:53.810> will<00:05:53.960> go<00:05:54.080> up<00:05:54.229> with<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:54.470> and

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
bottomed silver will go up with it and

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.379 
bottomed silver will go up with it and
then<00:05:54.950> when<00:05:55.430> it's<00:05:55.460> all<00:05:55.669> said<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.030> done<00:05:56.210> the

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
then when it's all said and done the

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.270 
then when it's all said and done the
silver<00:05:56.930> will<00:05:57.050> be<00:05:57.139> making<00:05:57.320> new<00:05:57.590> highs<00:05:57.620> with<00:05:58.190> the

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
silver will be making new highs with the

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.420 
silver will be making new highs with the
Dow<00:05:58.430> Jones<00:05:58.460> get<00:05:58.970> back<00:05:59.150> to<00:05:59.500> some<00:06:00.500> lower<00:06:00.979> level

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
Dow Jones get back to some lower level

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.659 
Dow Jones get back to some lower level
that's<00:06:01.550> a<00:06:01.729> possibility<00:06:02.440> I'm<00:06:03.440> going<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:03.800> segue

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
that's a possibility I'm going to segue

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.670 
that's a possibility I'm going to segue
this<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.599> finish<00:06:06.169> this<00:06:06.349> video<00:06:06.590> by<00:06:07.360> asking<00:06:08.360> a
