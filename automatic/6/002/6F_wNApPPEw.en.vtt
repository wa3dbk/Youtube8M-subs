but I was at a thrift shop the other day
and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> saw<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.859> bunch<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.309> old<00:00:32.759> 35<00:00:33.270> millimeter

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and I saw a bunch of old 35 millimeter

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.700 
and I saw a bunch of old 35 millimeter
cameras<00:00:34.910> they're<00:00:35.910> selling<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.719> between<00:00:36.989> 1

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cameras they're selling for between 1

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
cameras they're selling for between 1
and<00:00:37.860> 3<00:00:38.040> dollars<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> picked<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.809> with

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and 3 dollars so I picked one up with

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
and 3 dollars so I picked one up with
the<00:00:40.110> zoom<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.070> tore<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.309> apart<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the zoom and I tore it apart and this is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:55.569 
the zoom and I tore it apart and this is
what<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> found<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.480> definitely<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.020> very

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
what I found it was definitely a very

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
what I found it was definitely a very
labor-intensive<00:00:56.579> process<00:00:57.440> there's<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> lot<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
labor-intensive process there's a lot of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
labor-intensive process there's a lot of
screws<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.399> lot<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> different<00:00:59.820> parts<00:01:00.300> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
screws in a lot of different parts in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.770 
screws in a lot of different parts in
this<00:01:00.570> camera<00:01:03.409> it's<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.939> cheap<00:01:06.210> 35

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
this camera it's just a really cheap 35

this camera it's just a really cheap 35
millimeter<00:01:07.229> camera<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.090> pulled<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
millimeter camera I pulled out this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
millimeter camera I pulled out this
faceplate<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> used<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> mount

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
faceplate up here and used it as a mount

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
faceplate up here and used it as a mount
for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> lenses<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.229> found<00:01:13.590> inside<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
for the lenses that I found inside of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900 
for the lenses that I found inside of
the<00:01:14.250> camera

so<00:01:26.219> I<00:01:26.250> took<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> lenses<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.719> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so I took all the lenses out of the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.679 
so I took all the lenses out of the
camera<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.909> super<00:01:29.909> glue<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.270> onto<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
camera and super glue them onto this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.270 
camera and super glue them onto this
strip<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.560> hold<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.039> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
strip that I can hold up to the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.649 
strip that I can hold up to the
cellphone<00:01:32.729> camera<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> bunch<00:01:33.539> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
cellphone camera and get a bunch of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
cellphone camera and get a bunch of
different<00:01:33.810> effects<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:35.490> show

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
just a little bit of magnification the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.030 
just a little bit of magnification the
fourth<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.569> even<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:09.899> magnification

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.500 

and<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:18.299> last<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:20.480> dvd/cd<00:02:21.480> lens<00:02:22.170> i

and the last one is the dvd/cd lens i
showed<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.750> another<00:02:25.019> video

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
showed it in another video

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.039 
showed it in another video
that's<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.130> tiny<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.609> here<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:30.239> best<00:02:30.750> fine

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
that's the tiny one here the best fine

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.509 
that's the tiny one here the best fine
though<00:02:31.290> was<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> lens<00:02:31.859> from<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> front<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
though was the lens from the front of

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.680 
though was the lens from the front of
the<00:02:32.609> camera<00:02:34.010> which<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.280> very<00:02:35.730> easy<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.329> hold<00:02:36.450> up

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the camera which is very easy to hold up

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.750 
the camera which is very easy to hold up
to<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.079> cellphone<00:02:37.560> camera<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.810> gives<00:02:40.139> you<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
to the cellphone camera it gives you a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.990 
to the cellphone camera it gives you a
pretty<00:02:41.760> reasonable<00:02:42.060> amount<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:44.389> zoom<00:02:45.389> I<00:02:47.000> like

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
pretty reasonable amount of zoom I like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
pretty reasonable amount of zoom I like
this<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.209> lot<00:02:48.299> better<00:02:48.690> than<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.079> lot<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
this a lot better than a lot of the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.800 
this a lot better than a lot of the
other<00:02:49.859> lenses<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.730> I've<00:02:50.849> tried<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.630> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
other lenses that I've tried because you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.750 
other lenses that I've tried because you
don't<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.170> get<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.799> close<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.639> have

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
don't have to get so close that you have

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.780 
don't have to get so close that you have
a<00:02:53.819> problem<00:02:54.269> with<00:02:54.480> lighting

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:15.270 

[Music]

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.990 

so<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.730> have<00:03:16.880> an<00:03:17.150> hour<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.540> spare<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:19.000> very

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
so if you have an hour to spare and very

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.240 
so if you have an hour to spare and very
small<00:03:20.330> screwdriver<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.290> would<00:03:21.890> definitely
