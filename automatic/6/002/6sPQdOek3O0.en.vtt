00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.570
 Hello, all Alanis, how are you? 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.520
 before starting the video I ask you some 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 apologies for not uploading videos 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 lately what happens is that I had 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.270
 many tasks to deliver at my school 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 'Juan and ximo that justifies us that no 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.010
 I've uploaded videos and that's a pretext 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
 nobody speaks to you villager but for 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 Luck, it's already summer vacation and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 I will try to make videos more followed by 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 that's what he always says if he never 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's shut up villager but good now 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 I will speak for what they came and it is the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.149
 new image published by Scott cautious 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 let's analyze the in this image we can see 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.559
 to an animatronic or sitting on a chair 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 this time it does not take much analysis 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.370
 to give theories of who is this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.800
 animatronic since we can clearly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.110
 see that sprint trap by its color its 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 ears and his snout but still there is something 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.760
 that does not fit me which is the size of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 this spring trap clearly this model 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 of sprint track is not the same as we see 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.149
 in fight night sad fredys 3 because 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 obviously it is much smaller and not 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.899
 it might be the sprint trap 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 original but the question is why 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.610
 this sprint trap is much smaller 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.470
 that the original here I have a theory 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 and remember that in fight night sad 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 fredys 2 appeared some mini figures of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.800
 the animatronics because something like that could 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 be this little sprint track 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.180
 obviously not as small as you are 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.070
 figures since they do not look like because 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.690
 they are stuffed animals and the mini sprint track 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 it seems that it has a coming 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.560
 skeleton but I gave the example of the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 stuffed animals for you to make a 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 idea also above the mini sprint trap 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.610
 we can see a phrase that says terry 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.710
 coming veltins is mounts that translated 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.050
 it means terrible things come in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 small packages so this phrase 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.410
 it tells us that clearly this new 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 Sprint model is a version Trapé 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.970
 small and that can be very terrible to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 the best this animatronic or it can be of 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.850
 the most annoying in fight night sad 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.100
 fredys picture 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.220
 now let's increase the brightness to the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.530
 image and see what we come as 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.539
 you can see there are four big doors I 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.520
 I think it's for us to understand 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.260
 new that this spring trap is small 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.090
 but the weirdest thing is this mysterious 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.950
 purple spot to the corner of the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.930
 room possibly man's 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.000
 purple have something to do with this mini 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.770
 spring trap since we remember that the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 spring track costume was the one who caused 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.110
 his death in fight night sad fredys 3 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.250
 and good friends here ends this 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.230

 sure it is 30 curiosities of 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.210
 fight night sad prebisch 2 waiting and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.460
 Do not despair if I take a little because 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.860

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.780

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.260
 image that the truth surprised me a lot 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.660
 well, the new image is something 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.790
 different from the others because this time 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.130
 an animatronic geithner egg appears 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.050
