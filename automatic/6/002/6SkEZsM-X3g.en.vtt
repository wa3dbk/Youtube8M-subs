it<00:00:45.290> out<00:00:45.500> plug<00:00:45.920> into<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:46.549> good<00:00:46.729> time<00:00:47.260> so

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
it out plug into it have a good time so

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.250 
it out plug into it have a good time so
you<00:00:49.519> can<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:50.150> just<00:00:50.330> stick<00:00:50.510> over<00:00:50.690> some<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.140> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
you can we just stick over some of the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.859 
you can we just stick over some of the
finer<00:00:52.250> points<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.089> you<00:00:53.150> can<00:00:53.420> give<00:00:53.540> what

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
finer points of it so you can give what

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.270 
finer points of it so you can give what
sort<00:00:54.080> of<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.290> instruments<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:54.830> it<00:00:54.979> good<00:00:55.159> to

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
sort of that instruments is it good to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.090 
sort of that instruments is it good to
go<00:00:55.670> if<00:00:55.909> you<00:00:56.420> can<00:00:56.449> plug<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.960> violins<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.949> can

go if you can plug in violins you can

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.590 
go if you can plug in violins you can
plug<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.430> mandolin<00:00:58.939> to<00:00:58.970> any<00:00:59.210> stringed

so as soon as you click at the bass it
changes<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.220> EQ<00:01:07.580> firms<00:01:07.909> okay<00:01:08.539> work<00:01:08.780> well<00:01:09.020> with

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
changes the EQ firms okay work well with

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.330 
changes the EQ firms okay work well with
low<00:01:09.380> impact<00:01:09.560> instruments<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.719> must<00:01:11.899> ago

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
low impact instruments and you must ago

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.770 
low impact instruments and you must ago
these<00:01:13.340> these<00:01:13.729> UNAM<00:01:14.000> say<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> frequency

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
these these UNAM say that the frequency

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.380 
these these UNAM say that the frequency
and<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.229> absolute<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.969> three<00:01:17.240> so

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and not absolute is that three so

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.209 
and not absolute is that three so
instead<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:17.719> just<00:01:17.929> having<00:01:17.990> three<00:01:18.439> bands<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.829> EQ

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
instead of just having three bands of EQ

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.639 
instead of just having three bands of EQ
we<00:01:19.789> have<00:01:19.909> actually<00:01:20.329> mid<00:01:20.570> frequency<00:01:21.140> sweep<00:01:21.439> as

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
we have actually mid frequency sweep as

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.770 
we have actually mid frequency sweep as
well<00:01:22.219> as<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.399> knotch<00:01:22.729> selection<00:01:23.359> in<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.659> out

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
well as a knotch selection in and out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.889 
well as a knotch selection in and out
which<00:01:24.229> is<00:01:24.409> also<00:01:24.679> sweepable<00:01:25.310> as<00:01:25.520> well<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.999> the

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
which is also sweepable as well and the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.929 
which is also sweepable as well and the
compressor<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.499> was<00:01:27.710> sort<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.039> operating

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
compressor that was sort of operating

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.840 
compressor that was sort of operating
principle<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.810> this<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> single

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
principle is that this is a single

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.700 
principle is that this is a single
single<00:01:31.850> knob<00:01:31.999> soft<00:01:32.450> knee<00:01:32.659> compression<00:01:33.289> so

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
single knob soft knee compression so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.590 
single knob soft knee compression so
instead<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.130> really<00:01:34.280> cutting<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:34.700> off<00:01:34.850> hard<00:01:35.479> at

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
instead of really cutting it off hard at

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.690 
instead of really cutting it off hard at
the<00:01:35.719> top<00:01:35.960> at<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.170> bottom<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.890> softly<00:01:37.399> rolls

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the top at the bottom it softly rolls

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.849 
the top at the bottom it softly rolls
off<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.149> softly<00:01:38.479> brings<00:01:38.719> up<00:01:38.929> your<00:01:38.960> sound<00:01:39.319> so

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
off and softly brings up your sound so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.440 
off and softly brings up your sound so
you<00:01:39.950> have<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.069> more<00:01:40.310> even<00:01:40.460> sound<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.149> through

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
you have a more even sound going through

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.010 
you have a more even sound going through
and<00:01:42.319> in<00:01:42.469> terms<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.920> ratio<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.329> fixed<00:01:44.630> ratio

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
and in terms of ratio is it fixed ratio

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.859 
and in terms of ratio is it fixed ratio
compressor<00:01:45.770> or<00:01:46.009> it's<00:01:46.640> like<00:01:46.880> nothing<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.539> some

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
compressor or it's like nothing to some

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.490 
compressor or it's like nothing to some
okay<00:01:48.829> yeah

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
okay yeah

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.880 
okay yeah
and<00:01:50.590> then<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.100> got<00:01:51.280> another<00:01:52.560> another<00:01:53.560> one<00:01:53.800> of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
and then you got another another one of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.140 
and then you got another another one of
these<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.190> well<00:01:54.400> known<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:54.880> what<00:01:55.120> a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
these is well known that's what a

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.330
