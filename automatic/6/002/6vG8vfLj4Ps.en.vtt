00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 because everyone knows how to look if we 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 find today for a new 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 concept on my channel always around 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.559
 the universe japan mandates missions that 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.260
 I will call ben voila what I have 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 banon edition includes at least 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.550
 keep this time we will not talk 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.320
 in a single stroke of manga or animated by 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.060
 many but to talk about 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 development to do debates talked about 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 a lot of things and to start this 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.550
 first episode we'll talk about some 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.650
 something that is close to my heart since 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 long time I really wanted to talk about it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.420
 and that's the place of the black man in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.440
 Japanese animation 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.859
 as you could see I'm con 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 ah I know of the pope and the net 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.710
 Yes 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.949
 it's not that at the foot of the collection 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.949
 stamps 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.060
 we start and we know that Japan has 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.700
 typed avery far away from the continent 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.610
 African because of that the Japanese 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.410
 were more intrigued by the West so 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 the characters are more of a type 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.340
 Caucasian and therefore remote African type 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.770
 compared to the Communists who are the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.790
 American competitors manga where we 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.370
 can find afro american heroes 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.630
 what about Japanese animation 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.400
 for most of the time we give them 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 a place of bad ass take for example 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.740
 touch of black lagoon is the case luz 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.280
 key is all pink or ma hajime no 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.680
 ippo valga jean de vedas where there is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.210
 below you will have bleach or this 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.890
 guy who in paris short of a big 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.570
 sticks to sneakers with his chelou accent 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.970
 there but they do not necessarily have a side 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.180
 bad ass take for example the black the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.360
 best known in the low manga and stone 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.820
 of pokemon despite the fact that he has 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 slanted eyes cabbage never opened his eyes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.280
 in fact is that no one person comes 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.369
 to tell me ah but anything 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.100
 pokemon it's not a manga no do this 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.110
 that I want to agree now that in 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.400
 is he female characters 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.979
 among those that I could find in 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.020
 aliot richie of bleach and sailor put on 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.640
 knows their fly in the ball dom 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.110
 is a little bit black in the world have 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.179
 promised to nimes and sailor moon 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.190
 but over time she lost a little 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.250
 little I think we can not wait because this case of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 berserk is this one 9 th scratch 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.800
 loudun that he has kill and the characters 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.989
 black male do not necessarily have a side 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.170
 naughty he will often be mean during 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.110
 for example krishna of saint seiya or 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.820
 dragon ball or prefer gimmick's 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.280
 soul eater squarely kilic arm that's 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.870
 my 8gb profile picture over 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.720
 years to click on the picture you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.340
 subscribe the second is here and some 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.950
 other characters carry a place 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.110
 more important in their universe 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.910
 for that I speak of the village of kumo 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 in the roto chippendales 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.620
 this time it's more a person to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.130
 revive but it's downright a whole 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.290
 town 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.200
 a village we can find ninjas 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.440
 like killer bee of haruhi or raikage 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.420
 and many others and sometimes the author of 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.790
 the animated can even bigger and 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.100
 wants to squarely decide to put the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.920
 progress the main protagonist in 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.519
 black for example jackals nicole rey ward 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.890
 is a purely bad ass or afro assassin 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.290
 from afro samurai to samurai in search of 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.450
 revenge like kill bill later 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.549
 for samurai the best is that the voice 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.700
 from the character to fake and makes it straight 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.190
 by samuel l jackson the true what and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.870
 to finish in this description of 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.239
 black characters 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.670
 I will end up with the most controversial 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.440
 some say it's extraterrestrial and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.110
 else a caricature of the black man 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.230
 it's a perfect copy of jeans from 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.780
 pokemon and that's of course mr bobos de 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.000
 dragon ball or this character has so much 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.760
 controversial as the studios and in 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.950
 dragon ball z products have rum 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.959
 sir about blue yet of a 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.870
 box z kai no sense good we can see 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.560
 that every mangata more than his curiosity 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.420
 to set up a black character 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.440
 in her shed and even though she did not 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.239
 a lot I find it's not a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.629
 big problem that means at the same 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.220
 time that a black in Japan is not very 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.250
 common what and in addition it would make a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.169
 child there it would be a Chinese he 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.549
 lol and also why we find no 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.070
 black characters in a lot of 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.560
 inhaled mangas gives very quickly that I have 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.830
 found it's just because the mangaka 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
 we say that the offer to draw the 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.400
 characters it was expensive so instead 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.110
 to draw genre for example full 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.750
 night this gentleman about every page 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.910
 the africans two men and 20 and for 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.900
 conclude 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.360
 those who thought that 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.889
 that the blacks in the animated and the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.570
 mangas were more of the thick brutes 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.250
 who was beating everyone 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.710
 it must be said that in the diskette I 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.780
 did most that I found were 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.990
 nice people in the short story it's 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.030
 the end of this first episode 2 I do not 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.460
 do not know no name yet 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.410
 do not hesitate to give your opinion in the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.610
 comments to say what am I 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.250
 should do it's a good idea 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.259
 to have done that do not hesitate also to 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.669
 give a name if you like and to me 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.539
 give themes for my next 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.070
 emissions 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.539
 do not hesitate to see my 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.650
 next videos and I tell you
