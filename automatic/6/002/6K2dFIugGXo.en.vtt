00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
or either is one of these spots so one

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.569 
or either is one of these spots so one
of<00:01:22.259> these<00:01:22.409> spots<00:01:22.679> over<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.069> should<00:01:23.219> be<00:01:23.340> fine

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
of these spots over here should be fine

to get the food and usually the food

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.380 
to get the food and usually the food
starts<00:03:13.130> off<00:03:13.250> from<00:03:13.400> anywhere<00:03:13.760> from<00:03:13.819> I<00:03:14.120> believe

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
starts off from anywhere from I believe

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.020 
starts off from anywhere from I believe
from<00:03:14.599> in<00:03:14.870> Chaves<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:16.040> or<00:03:16.280> either<00:03:16.730> within
