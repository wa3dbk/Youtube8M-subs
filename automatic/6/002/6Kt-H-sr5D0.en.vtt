00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.010
 thom osaki yt is eh and for the last ipad 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.280
 I introduced a keep loose keyboard 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:18.279
 Well what do you think Doranez-I think in various ways 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:20.890
 Maybe yeah use remote desktop software and use it like a PC 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 I was wondering how to see is whether the best 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.310
 Please take a look at the wintering season 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.379
 The basic operation is 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:35.040
 I think that there is no problem with input of only ordinary ipad 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.790
 When hitting long sentences etc. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 I won the answer that there was a house board like this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.310
 Whether it is rarely hit the long sentence on that it is actually operating the ipad Well in 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.490
 think 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:54.570
 So if you use this ipad well and try to be a laptop mother 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:01.610
 I think that you can feel that it became difficult to get out the keyboard 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.610
 Immediately I would like to try to connect to leave the supplement with the shadow technique anymore To desktop in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.240
 App to use this time to deception and disk top and rd clients of micro software company 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.240
 Use the software say 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 Since the method of connection introduces various sites, please see the person there 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 This time I tried to connect to windows 7 of the main computer 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 Well then 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.479
 To try out the value of this keyboard 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.479
 I would like to use Excel 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.490
 Ipad office software by using remote desktop software 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 Paint can be edited 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.320
 Then I want to use it immediately 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.530
 I just want to make something like a calendar 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:21.010
 You can easily do this with regular editing like this 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.950
 This is windows 8.1 of the second machine 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.470
 Yeah like this 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 Well on a tablet laptop 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:36.620
 I think I can change it 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:41.710
 Well I think so much brewery actually I'm painting the video I want to explain, but after all 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:46.540
 If you have Rosa , buy a new PC 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:52.030
 Though I think also it can be referred to as use to open the ipad, which had until now 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 I think it will replace laptops like this by using well 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.690
 The ipad itself, for example, the one only pity is 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.270
 Well, take in the work or a 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.270
 To because that sort of thing has become so that it can not be 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.370
 It is a little drawback of it is difficult to say with the use of an external storage 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.860
 Others 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.840
 Well for example 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.860
 If you try to use image drive software or take advantage of such things 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.569
 I think that it will be completely plum blossoms 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.770
 Even with the presence of this keyboard before, the cursing power is greatly eased 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.569
 Then a building 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.810
 Flash related 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:41.719
 Although things were not usable with ipad 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.640
 Now, by making the man and the risk top now , for example , a game called "Nakare Ships" 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:47.819
 a 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.819
 It is c that will be also I say so Kedomo seems to be evicted 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.970
 Well if say leisure somehow now comment contains what looks bad after all 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.989
 If you use ipad only with ipad if you ask, it is until then 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.400
 In the same way as a laptop by combining well with such a keyboard 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.330
 It means that it can be used 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.970
 Especially because I have a docomo iphone 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:12.040
 In the British Association Dezaki if take advantage of the features of iphone tethering 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.490
 I think whether used completely as a mobile that you can use the net 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:21.670
 Especially to so such as Excel can be edited 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:24.900
 Because in terms of work I think I stand in your role if Moraere try one with such use 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.900
 It is more than I think
