00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello guys I'm viviana fabozzi and I am 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.020
 pleased to present you my new one 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700
 natural body art program which is a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.710
 training program of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.980
 toning that is exactly a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 half between the holistic world and that one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 instead of the specific work of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.670
 muscle conditioning we could also 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 say a more metabolic training job 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 it is in the essence of a hybrid 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
 of different disciplines that have some 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 represented what was mine 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 training growth in these years 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.309
 just my personal then the world 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 holistic and represented by all those 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.070
 postural disciplines such as cairo tonic 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 like pilates like the feldenkrais that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 I am currently studying and the world 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.469
 instead a little more functional and that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.700
 fitness related is definitely 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 represented by my last 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 experience of my own in these years 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.690
 training in all disciplines 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.489
 which characterize the functional the thing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 pretty and probably a lot 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.930
 interesting that the psychological aspect 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.880
 which puts the mind in a close relationship 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.660
 body really is 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.510
 he studied and experimented through it 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.430
 study of the five elements of the same 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.290
 cycle of life and from these five 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 elements are born four cycles of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.870
 training that will take the name of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.970
 nb air and ground water training e 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.550
 fire water and air will be 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.870
 representative of the most mind and appearance 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.540
 then through movement 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.210
 will certainly train the mind there 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.950
 concentration in the other land case e 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 fire represent more of the work of 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.050
 body then of the body and specifically 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.790
 then through concentration 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.740
 mind control 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.390
 they will be able to make the body more 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.250
 functional 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.380
 I really hope to see you many e 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 I think it's really interesting for 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.460
 all operators in the holistic sector 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.710
 very clear are the disciplines that it is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.540
 they represent and also all people 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 of the functional sector including those 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.080
 of musical fitness that for years 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.600
 they teach muscle conditioning 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.130
 therefore I am really waiting for you 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.030
 very many and thank you in the meantime for 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.570
 attention 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.570
 See you soon
