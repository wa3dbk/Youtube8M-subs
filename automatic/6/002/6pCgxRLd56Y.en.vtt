00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
then you get the USB here which comes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.800 
then you get the USB here which comes
from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.680> steering<00:01:13.680> wheel<00:01:14.570> I'm<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
from the steering wheel I'm going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
from the steering wheel I'm going to
plug<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.689> USB<00:01:19.140> port<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:21.240> YG's<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
plug it in to the USB port and I YG's I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
plug it in to the USB port and I YG's I
put<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> wire<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:22.979> desk<00:01:23.189> stain

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
put a wire on there's your desk stain

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.350 
put a wire on there's your desk stain
all<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.390> driving<00:01:26.270> next<00:01:27.270> thing

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
somewhere top of them there grab the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
somewhere top of them there grab the
connector<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.430> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
connector for that which is kind of like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.399 
connector for that which is kind of like
a<00:01:36.390> whiter<00:01:36.720> act<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:39.140> what<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
a whiter act I want is what you want to

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.690 
a whiter act I want is what you want to
do<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:42.470> bring<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> wire<00:01:43.770> round<00:01:44.659> over<00:01:45.659> here

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
do is bring the wire round over here

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.179 
do is bring the wire round over here
then<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:49.040> find<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
then what you want to do is find the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.410 
then what you want to do is find the
slope<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.060> plug<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:53.000> just<00:01:54.000> going

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
slope for it and then plug in just going

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
slope for it and then plug in just going
in<00:01:55.070> there<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:57.110> push<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.070> goes

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
in there because push down so that goes

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.899 
in there because push down so that goes
back<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.490> goes<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.060> there

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
back in there so that goes back in there

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.719 
back in there so that goes back in there
so<00:02:05.909> me

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
so me

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.160 
so me
and<00:02:08.209> we're<00:02:08.599> going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:09.050> power<00:02:09.259> from

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and we're going to get your power from

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
and we're going to get your power from
here<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.040> run<00:02:13.220> it<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:15.400> where<00:02:16.400> power

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
here and then run it into where power

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.990 
here and then run it into where power
goes<00:02:17.420> which<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:20.440> which<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:23.560> back<00:02:24.560> there<00:02:25.000> plug

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
goes which is which is back there plug

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.080 
goes which is which is back there plug
down<00:02:26.950> you'll<00:02:27.950> connect<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> same

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
down you'll connect it and on the same

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.699 
down you'll connect it and on the same
and<00:02:29.480> on<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.720> side<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> wire<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
and on that side up with the wire so it

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.910 
and on that side up with the wire so it
goes<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.730> stays<00:02:31.910> out<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> way

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
goes like that so it stays out the way

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.360 
goes like that so it stays out the way
let's<00:02:33.920> see<00:02:34.069> goes<00:02:34.940> right<00:02:35.209> up<00:02:35.420> there<00:02:36.220> now<00:02:37.220> we're

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370

1 and then 20 ps3 on and then the wheel

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.420 
1 and then 20 ps3 on and then the wheel
should<00:02:47.019> should<00:02:48.019> spin<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.920> let<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.250> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
should should spin to let you know that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.890 
should should spin to let you know that
it's<00:02:49.549> lighting<00:02:49.849> up<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:58.720> means<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.840> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's lighting up that means that the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.539 
it's lighting up that means that the
rule<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.170> now<00:03:00.319> connected<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.069> can<00:03:01.250> pull<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
rule is now connected and I can pull the

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:09.220 
rule is now connected and I can pull the
force<00:03:01.790> feedback<00:03:02.030> already<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.769> then<00:03:08.230> that's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
force feedback already and then that's

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.860 
force feedback already and then that's
how<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.410> connect<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.160> then<00:03:10.720> go<00:03:11.720> on<00:03:11.840> to
