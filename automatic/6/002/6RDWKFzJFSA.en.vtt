delete emails either individually by
tapping<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.830> holding<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.490> perhaps<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.180> want<00:02:49.420> to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
tapping and holding so perhaps I want to

let's<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.360> back<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.870> stage<00:02:59.170> or<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.830> can<00:03:00.430> do<00:03:00.760> that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
let's go back one stage or I can do that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.229 
let's go back one stage or I can do that
to<00:03:01.090> multiple<00:03:01.600> emails<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.190> could<00:03:03.550> put<00:03:04.090> little

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
to multiple emails so I could put little

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.320 
to multiple emails so I could put little
ticks<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.900> these<00:03:05.590> side<00:03:05.860> boxes<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.580> then

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
ticks in these side boxes and then

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.580 
ticks in these side boxes and then
delete<00:03:08.050> more<00:03:08.739> than<00:03:08.980> one<00:03:09.130> email<00:03:09.700> at<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.910> time

delete more than one email at a time

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.470 
delete more than one email at a time
that<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.920> basis<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.700> email<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.209> here

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
that is the basis of the email on here

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.410 
that is the basis of the email on here
the<00:03:14.110> screen<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.250> resistive<00:03:15.820> rather<00:03:16.150> than

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
the screen is resistive rather than

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.540 
the screen is resistive rather than
capacitive<00:03:16.989> which<00:03:17.560> still<00:03:17.830> seems<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.250> pick<00:03:18.430> up

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
touches very nicely on the keyboard

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.280 
touches very nicely on the keyboard
let's<00:03:21.910> go<00:03:22.060> back<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.690> home<00:03:22.900> screen

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
let's go back out to the home screen

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.520 
let's go back out to the home screen
just<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:24.610> show<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> home<00:03:25.239> screen<00:03:25.570> doesn't

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
just to show you the home screen doesn't

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.680 
just to show you the home screen doesn't
rotate<00:03:26.709> round<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.760> you're<00:03:28.209> stuck<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
web sites and I think

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.969 
web sites and I think
overall<00:04:45.909> you<00:04:46.720> know<00:04:46.840> reasonable<00:04:47.289> experience

we're on Wi-Fi at the moment we've got a

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.850 
we're on Wi-Fi at the moment we've got a
reasonable<00:05:09.969> viewing<00:05:10.419> angle<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.500> screen

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
you can see the orientation switching

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.730 
you can see the orientation switching
around<00:05:15.129> works<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.789> all<00:05:15.909> orientations<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.990> I

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
around works in all orientations and I

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.300 
around works in all orientations and I
think<00:05:18.069> a<00:05:18.250> very<00:05:18.569> nice<00:05:19.569> experience<00:05:20.110> actually<00:05:20.710> so

we can scroll round on here
perhaps<00:05:24.159> those<00:05:24.340> cones<00:05:24.580> in<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:24.849> store<00:05:25.349> again

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
perhaps those cones in the store again

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.830 
perhaps those cones in the store again
picks<00:05:26.979> up<00:05:27.159> my<00:05:27.310> touch<00:05:27.729> fine<00:05:28.210> on<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.539> screen

finger<00:05:38.500> gestures<00:05:38.949> so<00:05:39.490> we<00:05:39.610> have<00:05:39.759> to<00:05:39.940> resort<00:05:40.210> to

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
finger gestures so we have to resort to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.629 
finger gestures so we have to resort to
the<00:05:40.569> plus<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.020> minus<00:05:41.409> in<00:05:41.680> this<00:05:41.889> corner<00:05:42.250> here
