00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.990
 this is not the introduction of the kia 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.910
 cee'd of those we have known for a long time but it 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.830
 is a car very happy with it 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.540
 so a car that is very reliable that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.760
 is very safe very efficient just 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.720
 good car immediately what is for most 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 a little space 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.710
 well i brought a blog air pump 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.710
 we are going to pump up a bit 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.730
 ok well then what is that new 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.730
 kia carens 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.050
 the uniqueness of the core is that it 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.550
 a seven-seater is standard 2 seats 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.480
 lie in the floor and I can 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.480
 very simple up 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 how much room do you have there then me 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.329
 've tried myself but point 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.680
 as you can see a little tanner 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.979
 so our junior not you go just a moment 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979
 to attempt 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.860
 well how do you know i am not there but 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.360
 it doesn't end 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.800
 I can I can't lose my legs you 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.509
 head clearly we are not suitable 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.590
 as tony just didn't know before 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.930
 adults 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.190
 ok of course you drive most of the time 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.630
 not even sit down but he really me 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.280
 as a five-seater 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.750
 what does attack you have quite a lot 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.580
 luggage room 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.990
 with that second row up you are already 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.060
 about 410 liters 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.409
 if you fold down it is now even about 800 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.300
 white and quite large for its class 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.470
 and the second is stand out is real 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.149
 everywhere you look for all 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.810
 occupants trays and boxes and 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.840
 cup holders 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.429
 here it starts here cup holders 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.470
 cup holders boxes 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.590
 therefore check box and look very big 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 word 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.250
 how is it going that i looked once 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 a few comments especially about it 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.800
 and they are not all 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.810
 positive 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.220
 the first is that send itself that is best 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
 busy it is a lot 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.450
 buttons for the audio for the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.700
 navigation for the phone for the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.140
 menus and also reason special for it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.550
 send setting 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 you can set a male to 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.580
 normal comfort and sport you think of now 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.530
 then you can handle everything but no in 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.720
 all three classes are those around that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.550
 We are certainly vague on the middle class 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.990
 highway van you are constantly but too 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.470
 correct and steer 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.450
 the view around that was pretty annoying 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 is pretty bad for a mpv only the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.660
 steep the c-styles 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.290
 are the styles behind the rear doors 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.290
 they are somewhat thick 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.050
 in the second row there is sufficient space 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.050
 for legs and head 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.210
 the three seats in the back that can 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.790
 separate from each other just forward to 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.470
 slide back and roll is going to be the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 two outside seats that have isofix 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.770
 child seat attachment 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.380
 but not that special what a very one 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.290
 special is that old is wide enough that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.020
 there are three child seats next to each other on the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.000
 rear seat can with the seating position of 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.010
 a few things negative at first 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.160
 the sessions are as short as you what 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.720
 long thighs have it the second 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.150
 send that can you both in height and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.490
 adjust depth but not far enough 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.870
 bring to you with third is the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.150
 backrest that is not infinitely variable 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.380
 adjustable so chances are you 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.380
 just not completely comfortable 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.200
 because i'm going to be brand new 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.880
 is they have a very interesting first 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.600
 edition version with 1000 euros 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.310
 additional 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.990
 do you have climate control navigation and a 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.220
 control light sensor but you also want it 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.870
 nice alloy and bill you 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.800
 parking sensors and go straight to the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.180
 business pack 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.180
 that will take 4,000 euros 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.039
 drive with the smallest gasoline version with 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.169
 are a point 6 liters 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.900
 directly injected petrol engine with 135 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.960
 pk on sounds pretty nice my this 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.439
 car is quite so well because if you 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.699
 just being kicked then shoot it 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.430
 not really up 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.689
 scoop of heap of sugar from back 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.550
 what does work with it is that 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.349
 six bin turns very quickly very 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.090
 exactly 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.830
 we are economical, it is just the factory 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.270
 calls one or 15 half but good that ar 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.740
 of course never but we come too 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.400
 test consumption of one in 13 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.400
 would be pretty neat 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.950
 because some conclusion about once 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.230
 per inch well it's not really the new one 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.090
 benchmark in its class but there are 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.220
 a few handy things to be able to three 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.280
 high chair next to each other in the back and 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.810
 has a little more number 7 2 times 7 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.940
 it's kia so you have seven years 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.200
 warranty second is it is standard 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.200
 a seven-seater and that is certainly unique 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.640
 find enough like that
