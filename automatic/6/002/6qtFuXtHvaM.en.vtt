00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.150 
I'm gonna go ahead and try it you may
just<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.270> little<00:02:14.540> pop<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:14.960> first<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.560> that's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
just do a little pop up first and that's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.250 
just do a little pop up first and that's
okay<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> we'll<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.270> give<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> little<00:02:18.110> bit

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
okay and we'll just give it a little bit

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
okay and we'll just give it a little bit
more<00:02:18.410> pressure<00:02:18.620> next<00:02:19.130> time<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.490> get<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> go<00:02:19.820> up

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
more pressure next time to get a go up

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:44.680 
more pressure next time to get a go up
to<00:02:20.150> go<00:02:20.270> up<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.570> little<00:02:20.810> bit<00:02:20.990> longer<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:44.540> you'll

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to go up a little bit longer if you'll

00:02:44.690 --> 00:03:24.200 
to go up a little bit longer if you'll
notice<00:02:44.930> while<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.350> made

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.040 

some<00:03:25.210> horses<00:03:25.600> are<00:03:25.990> more<00:03:26.910> built<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.240> able<00:03:28.840> to

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
some horses are more built and able to

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.440 
some horses are more built and able to
hold<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.650> longer<00:03:30.070> rear<00:03:30.310> which<00:03:30.880> actually<00:03:31.270> may<00:03:31.420> be

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
hold a longer rear which actually may be

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.220 
hold a longer rear which actually may be
a<00:03:31.600> Levada<00:03:33.300> Mamie<00:03:34.300> her<00:03:34.750> balance<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.550> not

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
a Levada Mamie her balance is not

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.810 
a Levada Mamie her balance is not
adequate<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.260> doing<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.710> violets<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.670> what

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
adequate for doing the violets so what

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.930 
adequate for doing the violets so what
we<00:03:39.970> do<00:03:40.120> our<00:03:40.420> rears<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:41.800> etherion<00:03:42.310> horses<00:03:42.700> are

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
we do our rears the etherion horses are

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.080 
we do our rears the etherion horses are
phenomenal<00:03:43.690> at<00:03:43.930> doing<00:03:44.200> rears<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.580> holding

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
phenomenal at doing rears and holding

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.180 
phenomenal at doing rears and holding
back<00:03:46.210> at<00:03:46.390> certain<00:03:46.750> angles<00:03:47.110> which<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.800> called<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
back at certain angles which is called a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:04:03.960 
back at certain angles which is called a
Lou<00:03:48.310> Bava<00:03:48.520> so<00:04:01.800> that's<00:04:02.800> about<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.550> thanks

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
Lou Bava so that's about it so thanks

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.550 
Lou Bava so that's about it so thanks
for<00:04:04.060> tuning<00:04:04.240> in<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.900> may<00:04:08.050> have<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.260> part

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
for tuning in and we may have a part

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.970 
for tuning in and we may have a part
three<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.220> thanks
