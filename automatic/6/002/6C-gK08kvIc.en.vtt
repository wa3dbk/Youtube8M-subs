 Hi, I'm me, and you're on my channel. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.750
 sometimes when we make a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 filming we are faced with a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.690
 type problem because it does not get much 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.690
 good 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 type this here when you will avoid 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.480
 make your friends put a video 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.189
 but it 's a lot of effect and sometimes the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 people are faced with a problem that is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 Now, how's this video here? 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
 I know I'll ask rabbit and that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 video I'll show you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 the tools are considered better 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.500
 not everyone is taking treatment and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.270
 video and inside the pt is that it was a thing 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.649
 that the people asked for today, I just want 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 to treat my son I do not 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.800
 I know how to do it so I decided to go 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.020
 show you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 some tools you can control 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 A little bit is the image is the colors of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.390
 your child how they are behaving 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.390
 to try to fix it is prepared 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.680
 When we think and treat it is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.229
 so let's say within the first 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.670
 Sometimes it 's hard to know exactly where to go. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.380
 so I'll show you in this video 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 How do you do that and then I go? 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 I do will leave a small piece here as well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.150
 cool this face here is good and let's go 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.650
 say that I want to apply an effect 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.930
 here then I'll do what I came 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 I'll stay on the left side here 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 bar and drag to the right and I 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.380
 I have this panel and flex reflection of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.939
 all the effects you want to apply 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.979
 they are here are transition effects 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
 and video tapes and audio and everything 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
 we will come here in video 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.329
 effects click here on this little set 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 open some options for you you have 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.579
 several options to work for us 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.500
 to work on this matter of adjusting 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.680
 actually do a treatment in this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 video you came from justi adjust click 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.570
 here or in the triangle you have several 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
 types of effects that you can put 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.619
 To have one, let's say the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.979
 treatment in this video what I like 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.090
 very much and if it is proclaimed as me 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.259
 I do not know, it 's new 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.450
 Sorry, I do not know when he will 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 The premier began to talk like that. 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.750
 but I'll click and drag and drop 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.420
 here on top of my video 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.629
 I dropped 1 on top of the video tank already 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.580
 insert if is going to come here ifet controls 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.379
 which are the effects controls of the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.800
 premier and then you'll see that here I 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.230
 have 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 backpack on test and time and mep eu 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 I have procap because it is actually the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
 effect that I just applied in the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.020
 I then premiere to change what I 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.630
 I'll do it, I can just click. 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.300
 here on the value of blogs but 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.460
 click dragged if you play for 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.620
 right the video will lighten up if you 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.300
 play to the left it gets dark 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.100
 It's logical that everything I 'm going to show 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.070
 for you first of all it depends 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.670
 much of the fact of your video my video 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.290
 here his original is already good does not have 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.270
 So much to play, right? 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.770
 but it depends a lot on the video so it goes 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.930
 depend on your seeing is too dark 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.550
 You 'll have to vary more clearly try 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.530
 It has darkened a little, so here it is. 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.300
 I can hear brightman I'll put a 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.440
 little right and clear how much 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.900
 I think it's cool 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.870
 I do not know if I can even click on 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.490
 up and digital value two dots have 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.870
 a contrast that I can drag to 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.760
 to the right and left of renan 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.890
 I contrast with contrast here in my video 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.930
 and of course I'm standing on top of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.520
 some specific brake on this video only 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.320
 that you have to keep in mind the following everything 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.239
 here is going to be applied this is not going to be 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.100
 applied only to this frame will be 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.739
 applied for this entire video clip 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.360
 I also have the river options here in 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.940
 down where I can play right 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 to the left to tinker with the range of 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.510
 color I do not like to touch it here 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.070
 I always leave 0 and I have the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.260
 china actors where can i put to 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.760
 right and leave more vivid or 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.510
 to the left to leave black and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.070
 White 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.110
 logical that you have to keep in mind the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.150
 depends depends on everything you 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.770
 are doing there are values ​​that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.570
 depends on your video for you to apply 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.750
 another effect that I really like 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.940
 apply also the read if below here 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.400
 Lightweight I'm going to click on program that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.260
 I'll delete and I'll click the light and I'll 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.480
 drag on top of my video trio 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.190
 so I got this second value 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.370
 here where I can drag left foot and 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.800
 to clarify a little more the third value 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.020
 it is also logical to take it more 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.660
 for those who already came from photoshop to speak 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.850
 to let them have no light and only have to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.690
 it's kind of boring salt take the serve inside the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
 premier 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.609
 other options you also have you 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.380
 You can wear this collor high heel 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.850
 try to even apply some options 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.800
 for you options to work but I do not 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.240
 I really like these options. I really like them. 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.570
 to work sometimes when the colors 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.270
 not 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.120
 very good with this option here where 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.010
 collor balance that is within the option 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.070
 put the rating then the pastry 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.300
 put action the option collor balance I 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.100
 I can click and drag 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.470
 only that it is more for those who come from 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.060
 photoshop with the image processing and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.850
 here i have options today to work 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.100
 with the shadows in the shadow the middle tones 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.110
 and light tones where I can by clicking 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.420
 and dragging the first sale value 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.390
 is leaving a little more vivid colors 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.950
 a little bit but he tunes in, right? 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.560
 playing more to the right or to the 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.150
 left I can not touch the tones 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.910
 green and blue reds and 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.860
 more blue or blue removing or placing 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.330
 more green red and everything else I can 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.370
 work with these guys 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.490
 these are some of the options I use 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.860
 to work with colors, so not with 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.510
 the most logical video depends on the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.670
 So much of what you want to do. 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.220
 I advise if these options that I 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.140
 I did not look good, some 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.750
 effects they always have on these 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.240
 adjusting tabs and lap that the 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.310
 good brushing we arrived at the end of this 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.620
 video hope you understand the process 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.930
 you treat things first is a 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.060
 thing or if they do not have much so the 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.010
 what to do if a little notion of the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.930
 things is to know a little of the flowers 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.820
 study a little about it but the 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.350
 tools are these 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.210
 if you liked if you plan to produce 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.800
 also gives a young man and this helps me to 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.150
 to know that you liked what I am 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.560
 doing here 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.130
 if you did not like it and you could also put 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.470
 What do you like, it's okay, we have people. 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.470
 recorded next rides 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.370
 I think the dog is the kaka 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.830
 that's probably your dog too 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.750
 It's also one of those that disturbs my 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.370
 job is to profile your adobe course 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.900
 premiere and enjoyed it very much like to 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.340
 to know if you have any film courses 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.340
 4d in 3d max
