number and having that delay well I

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.700 
number and having that delay well I
tried<00:06:10.060> not<00:06:10.390> to<00:06:10.630> like<00:06:10.840> worry<00:06:11.170> about<00:06:11.440> too<00:06:11.590> much

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.170 
tried not to like worry about too much
but<00:06:12.010> every<00:06:12.220> was<00:06:12.490> starting<00:06:12.730> to<00:06:12.790> look<00:06:12.910> for<00:06:13.090> my

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
but every was starting to look for my

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.120 
but every was starting to look for my
numbered<00:06:13.570> I<00:06:13.960> wasn't<00:06:14.470> exactly<00:06:14.590> sure<00:06:14.830> where<00:06:15.100> I

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
numbered I wasn't exactly sure where I

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.830 
numbered I wasn't exactly sure where I
put<00:06:15.460> it<00:06:15.520> because<00:06:15.850> I<00:06:16.030> took<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.420> out<00:06:16.510> of<00:06:16.570> my<00:06:16.660> bag

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
put it because I took it out of my bag

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.510 
put it because I took it out of my bag
at<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.140> back<00:06:17.380> trip<00:06:17.650> and<00:06:17.830> I<00:06:17.920> guess<00:06:18.370> I<00:06:18.490> just

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
at the back trip and I guess I just

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.520 
at the back trip and I guess I just
forgot<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:18.880> hannahs<00:06:19.180> my<00:06:19.300> coach<00:06:19.510> but<00:06:19.810> on<00:06:19.900> so<00:06:20.230> I

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
tried to come straight but I think I'm

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.310

over to the beam and there's another
delay<00:06:28.880> not<00:06:29.210> your<00:06:29.510> fault<00:06:29.780> but<00:06:30.020> the<00:06:30.110> technical
