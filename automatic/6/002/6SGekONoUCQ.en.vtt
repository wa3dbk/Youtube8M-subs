00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.430
 guys, I liked it a lot because I played 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.120
 in this xi is a real challenge especially 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.000
 if you play in hardcore and said this then 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.010
 also tell you what are you doing and why not 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 too many things brings a pretty thing 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.420
 bestial but does not bring a large amount 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.979
 of things and if you still have not understood me 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.870

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.170

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 beautiful island of the great and vast ocean of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.860

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.580
 blocks 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.580

 is the most rum go guys the truth 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.070
 is that good quantity is put in a 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.800
 small island and well I will leave the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.500
 island and suddenly find yourself 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.630

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.180
 explains pretty galactic to me I like 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.480
 very much especially because what is there 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.980
 another island where we're going to go to her the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.460
 I really like it a lot because 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.230

 sugar cane sugar guys one of the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.290
 most important elements as we could 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.450
 cultivate it web is the block majors no and 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.880
 we have a big tree where you spend 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.910
 I fixed a link toad, that is, the truth is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.700
 that do not make it difficult yes but not so 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.980
 complicated further down here we have dirt 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.930
 Well, if we want to expand the zones 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 from here the sea are bigger and na boys 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.740

 tell you also about these and that there is a 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.150
 triple is pauner of spiders that is 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.880
 quite complicated to go visit him 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.770
 because it 's all a bad little bit out there 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.050
 down then I'll tell you where 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.160
 is the ma af that is a mainz af 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.050
 tremendous 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.050
 let's see around here not here 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.870

 amaz mainz that good has wood by 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.000
 here the spiders begin 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.890
 so then it would be very good that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.690
 he visits 6 because they will be resources 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.330
