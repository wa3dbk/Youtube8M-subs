00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.180
 now we are going to proceed to planting 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.549
 we are going to plant pepper and tomato 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.470
 secret of a good cultivator is 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.420
 get ahead of the crops the most 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.529
 possible you always have to be a little 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.960
 Attentive to the time you are going to do 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.079
 temperature especially to be able 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.119
 get ahead as much as possible not 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.099
 we can see sowing peppers in February 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.509
 because we would leave but good now with 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.670
 the time you are doing we are going to 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.829
 proceed with it with the substrate that we 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.320
 has left and with these trays a 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.030
 Normal plastic tray is not necessary 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.730
 make the hole because we are not going to water 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.230
 so that you can puddle this with this 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.140
 with this plastic 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.950
 fill with a little more earth or 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.950
 less in half 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.590
 about half 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.780
 we were a little bit 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.030
 Well, in principle we are going to plant a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.030
 pepper of the variety that is cayenne 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 which is a tiny spicy pepper that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.750
 it is not going to develop much our 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.060
 planters so it's ideal then 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.510
 we take out this is a selected seed 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.450
 for us by burgo guard and after 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.970
 of a few years of cultivating the the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.979
 we keep in these containers and the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.250
 we sow well we can take it in the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.250
 hand 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.100
 we are going to plant half of the planter 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's throw all and the other half 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.370
 let's put tomato tomato is to expand 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.010
 is a globose variety is a tomato 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.780
 very tasty red here I have a lot 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.780
 seed we are going to throw all 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.680
 we are not going to take a little hand 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.680
 as well 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.270
 and in the seed what he does is in the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.130
 seed is a reservoir of energies the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.610
 which is not going to need a substrate 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.320
 very rich because he precisely the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 plant food comes in the same 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.130
 the seed itself then ever 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.360
 sowed so what we do is take a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 little crumbled a capita for 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.710
 cover just the seed as much 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.000
 we cover 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.000
 a little bit the seed 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.520
 once capped 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.420
 but let's say a little 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.230
 enough 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 and we close the lid well this stage can 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 be closed 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.019
 in the late afternoon we can close 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.030
 the lid in the late afternoon to 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.250
 to keep a little warm but then 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 at the beginning of the day then we can 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.769
 open can even be open vale 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.140
 this on the balcony in a little corner 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.540
 sun try not to put it in the sun with the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.440
 lid closed because it would be known 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.390
 the seeds 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.299
 when we left the sun will 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.099
 we open the lid and leave it like that when 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.099
 germinen we will see what makes use
