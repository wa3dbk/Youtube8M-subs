00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
for a surfboard but we'll go with it

and if you can manage to catch a wave
this<00:02:00.060> thing<00:02:00.299> goes<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.869> bloody<00:02:01.680> fast<00:02:02.010> oh

see flying around which is just part of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.460 
see flying around which is just part of
the<00:02:08.789> mod<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> guess<00:02:09.299> to<00:02:09.840> make<00:02:09.959> things<00:02:10.200> look<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the mod I guess to make things look a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.869 
the mod I guess to make things look a
little<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.799> more<00:02:10.920> stormy<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.580> happens

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
little bit more stormy that happens

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.970 
little bit more stormy that happens
where<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.239> raining<00:02:12.689> or<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.950> a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
where it's raining or not which is a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.460 
where it's raining or not which is a
nice<00:02:14.489> addition<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:15.060> guess<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.870> I'd<00:02:16.019> get<00:02:16.200> off<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
nice addition I guess so I'd get off the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.000 
nice addition I guess so I'd get off the
surfboard<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.239> love<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.389> surfboard<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.010> we

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
surfboard I love that surfboard and we

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.920 
surfboard I love that surfboard and we
will<00:02:20.159> get<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.849> finishing<00:02:21.419> these<00:02:21.599> chests

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
will get on to finishing these chests

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.550 
will get on to finishing these chests
before<00:02:22.319> they

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
before they

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220 
before they
absolutely<00:02:23.190> destroyed<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
absolutely destroyed so there are I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.960 
absolutely destroyed so there are I
think<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.770> five<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.580> five

which have a use sort of do random

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.820 
which have a use sort of do random
things<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> test<00:02:33.780> item<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> moment

with<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.580> up<00:03:05.580> shoots<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.180> load<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.450> blocks

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
with it and up shoots a load of blocks

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.470 
with it and up shoots a load of blocks
just<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.549> ground<00:03:08.790> randomly<00:03:09.360> out<00:03:09.390> of

just out of the ground randomly out of
the<00:03:09.540> ground<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:11.610> generates<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.299> really

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the ground and it generates this really

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.740 
the ground and it generates this really
long<00:03:13.170> brown<00:03:16.190> rectangle<00:03:17.190> I'm<00:03:17.819> not<00:03:18.120> sure<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
long brown rectangle I'm not sure the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.830 
long brown rectangle I'm not sure the
exact<00:03:19.140> use<00:03:19.500> for<00:03:19.739> this<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.450> mix<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.599> long

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
exact use for this I mix a long

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.100 
exact use for this I mix a long
rectangle<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.680> dirt<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.430> stone<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
rectangle of dirt and stone it's a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.020 
rectangle of dirt and stone it's a
little<00:03:25.380> unusual<00:03:25.530> why<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.579> why<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:26.850> called

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
little unusual why it's why it's called

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.910 
little unusual why it's why it's called
the<00:03:27.120> test<00:03:27.329> item<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.620> think<00:03:28.890> I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
the test item because it's I think I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.229 
the test item because it's I think I
guess<00:03:29.100> maybe<00:03:29.340> they're<00:03:29.489> trying<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.670> test<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
guess maybe they're trying to test it to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.210 
guess maybe they're trying to test it to
create<00:03:30.540> structures<00:03:31.049> I'm<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.470> sure<00:03:31.650> but

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
create structures I'm not sure but

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.650 
create structures I'm not sure but
that's<00:03:32.310> pretty<00:03:32.640> cool<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.450> we've<00:03:33.540> got<00:03:33.630> a

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that's pretty cool so we've got a

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.759 
that's pretty cool so we've got a
shockwave<00:03:33.959> item<00:03:34.500> which<00:03:35.160> does<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.900> pretty

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
shockwave item which does this pretty

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.349 
shockwave item which does this pretty
much<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.069> flips<00:03:38.340> over<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.670> ground<00:03:38.880> if<00:03:39.239> you

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
much just flips over the ground if you

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.530 
much just flips over the ground if you
stood<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.769> when<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.069> happens<00:03:41.370> you're<00:03:42.209> sort

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
stood on it when it happens you're sort

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.449 
stood on it when it happens you're sort
of<00:03:42.569> gets<00:03:42.750> stuck<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> ground<00:03:43.430> like<00:03:44.430> that

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
I think he's might be calming down this

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.119 
I think he's might be calming down this
hope<00:06:25.529> it<00:06:25.649> stops
