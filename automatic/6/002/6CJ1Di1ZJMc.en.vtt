00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.440
 hear 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.390
 Dolores goes through the videos of Fernando 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.040
 arms forward fernando pains not you 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.860
 go to bother if we criticize you not 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.190
 be that you leave and then not leave us 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.940
 you leave with pains 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.080
 you leave us with pains the truth that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.570
 when one has already mastered the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.400
 character comes out very naturally already 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.350
 sometimes until one relaxes he did not have to 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.030
 an excellent invitation but I think 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.190
 you should not forget about the energy that 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.180
 puts the singer in each presentation 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.070
 ok many thanks fernando 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.960
 maricarmen marÃ­n we listen to your opinion 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.940
 It has been a correct presentation 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.550
 what Fernando says to you 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.560
 I finish feeling the energy and vocally 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.080
 the shades have been good the breaks 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.640
 characteristic of pains and you have to 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.710
 be careful in tuning so 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.470
 everything else very well many thanks 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.800
 mari carmen lord ricardo now 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.300
 we hear your opinion is obvious no 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.920
 only that you sing very well but that 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.260
 It is a very good imitation of pains 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.700
 o'riordan I'm not going to discuss it I'm going to 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.250
 tell you things that I feel are 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.370
 happening that I think you have to observe 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.630
 and detect I think you 're still with 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.310
 fear here 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.860
 I feel that you have entered a little bit with 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.730
 fear of the scenario and that has not had 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.270
 this presentation until the end when 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.370
 came the shuffle of the shoulders the coast the 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.230
 Spark of joy that has pains 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.150
 throughout the whole reference video 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.710
 when he sings this song I think he has 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.000
 I am missing suddenly I felt that 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.890
 this is a little a little constanza 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.960
 concentrated on singing the benefit has 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.520
 I've been fine, I just feel like I'm missing a 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.280
 little more than chip with a little more than 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.140
 joy I think you should also soften 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.210
 a little bit the import of tubes is 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.210
 a bit hard suddenly you have to warm up 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.790
 and the moment you go up there that 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.200
 granite to raise the falsetto also 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.970
 it's a bit hard and I think you can 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.950
 soften more to look even more like 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.420
 pain or riordan you wanted to do something if 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.350
 I made the mistake of doing a test of 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.700
 sound wrong with mine 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.500
 as I have but I have to tell you a 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.030
 thing else I expected more problems from 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.290
 pronunciation and I did not hear so many 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.570
 that out there we are also better 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.400
 thank you very much jury gentlemen 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.400
 I ask that you please take a seat
