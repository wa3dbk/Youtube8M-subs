00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.899

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.509

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.789
 I had trouble sleeping 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.719
 with trailers 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.319

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.109
 alarm clocks 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.089
 the process goes on 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.099
 I was learning 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.499

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.969

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.320
