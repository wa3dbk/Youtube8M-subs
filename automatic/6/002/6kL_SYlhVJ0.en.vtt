00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
I don't know I'm in two minds whether

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.270 
I don't know I'm in two minds whether
I'm<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.480> man<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.900> job<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:15.010> feel<00:02:15.250> it

I'm the man for the job you feel it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.110 
I'm the man for the job you feel it
might<00:02:15.580> throw<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> towel<00:02:16.620> um<00:02:17.620> I'm<00:02:18.400> not<00:02:18.640> I've

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
might throw in the towel um I'm not I've

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120 
might throw in the towel um I'm not I've
never<00:02:19.360> quit<00:02:19.630> anything<00:02:19.690> I've<00:02:20.560> done<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
never quit anything I've done and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.530 
never quit anything I've done and
possibly<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.820> just<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.120> initial

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
possibly it's just this initial

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
possibly it's just this initial
disappointment<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:24.070> going<00:02:24.340> down<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
disappointment it going down to the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.150 
disappointment it going down to the
fourth<00:02:24.970> division<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:25.650> I'm<00:02:26.650> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> think

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
fourth division but I'm going to think

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.820 
fourth division but I'm going to think
about<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.459> over<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.670> next<00:02:27.970> week<00:02:28.120> or<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.299> but

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
about it over the next week or so but

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.289 
about it over the next week or so but
possibly<00:02:29.830> that'll<00:02:30.220> go<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.580> I've<00:02:30.940> been<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
possibly that'll go and I've been a

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.820 
possibly that'll go and I've been a
fighter<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.780> I'll<00:02:31.900> probably<00:02:32.140> come<00:02:32.410> back<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
fighter and I'll probably come back and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.710 
fighter and I'll probably come back and
hopefully<00:02:33.220> I'll<00:02:33.549> be<00:02:33.580> given<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.180> chance<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
hopefully I'll be given that chance to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.840 
hopefully I'll be given that chance to
to<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.980> team<00:02:36.160> back<00:02:36.220> up<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.730> third

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
to get the team back up to the third

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.270 
to get the team back up to the third

to<00:02:39.310> join<00:02:39.489> Swindon<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.360> ground<00:02:40.630> without<00:02:40.870> him

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
to join Swindon the ground without him

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.990 
to join Swindon the ground without him
would<00:02:41.470> end<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.860> nearer<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.670> at<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> moment

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
would end a nearer but at the moment

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.780 
would end a nearer but at the moment
he's<00:02:43.600> disenchanted<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.769> his<00:02:45.130> football

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
he's disenchanted with his football

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.500 
he's disenchanted with his football
I<00:02:47.769> think<00:02:48.769> you're<00:02:48.860> bound<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.219> I've<00:02:50.180> had<00:02:50.329> my<00:02:50.480> ups

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
I think you're bound to I've had my ups

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.869 
I think you're bound to I've had my ups
and<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.200> said<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.409> got<00:02:51.709> relegated<00:02:52.040> twice<00:02:52.519> as<00:02:52.819> a

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
and as I said I got relegated twice as a

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.170 
and as I said I got relegated twice as a
player<00:02:53.230> nothing<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:55.400> disappointing<00:02:55.819> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
player nothing it's disappointing is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.410 
player nothing it's disappointing is
that<00:02:56.379> but<00:02:57.379> being<00:02:58.010> manager<00:02:58.549> it's<00:02:58.730> even<00:02:59.000> more<00:02:59.209> so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
that but being manager it's even more so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.149 
that but being manager it's even more so
it<00:02:59.569> hits<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.870> harder<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.290> think<00:03:00.530> people<00:03:01.040> are

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
it hits you harder I think people are

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.580 
it hits you harder I think people are
obviously<00:03:01.519> having<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.810> go<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.409> in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
obviously having a go that you're in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.530 
obviously having a go that you're in
charge<00:03:03.799> in<00:03:04.099> your<00:03:04.340> you're<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.000> blame<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.420> all

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
charge in your you're to blame and all

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.259 
charge in your you're to blame and all
this<00:03:05.689> but<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:06.170> would<00:03:06.769> like<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.920> think<00:03:07.129> it's<00:03:07.549> a

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
this but I would like to think it's a

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.390 
this but I would like to think it's a
collective<00:03:09.019> thing<00:03:09.230> why<00:03:09.470> we've<00:03:09.739> gone<00:03:09.920> down<00:03:10.159> it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
collective thing why we've gone down it

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.369 
collective thing why we've gone down it
obviously<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.209> money<00:03:11.420> hasn't<00:03:11.989> been<00:03:12.140> there

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
obviously the money hasn't been there

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.610 
obviously the money hasn't been there
since<00:03:12.439> I<00:03:12.769> took<00:03:12.889> over<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:14.599> I've<00:03:15.079> had<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.379> try<00:03:15.560> to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
since I took over and I've had to try to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.280 
since I took over and I've had to try to
fill<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.730> gaps<00:03:16.909> with<00:03:17.030> maybe<00:03:17.599> younger<00:03:17.959> players

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
fill the gaps with maybe younger players

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.890 
fill the gaps with maybe younger players
who<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:19.700> come<00:03:20.000> on<00:03:20.180> during<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.569> season<00:03:20.870> but

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
who have come on during the season but

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.229 
who have come on during the season but
obviously<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:21.920> can't<00:03:22.189> to<00:03:22.639> replace

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
obviously you can't to replace

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.759 
obviously you can't to replace
experience<00:03:23.959> straight<00:03:24.230> away<00:03:24.439> with<00:03:24.680> the

experience straight away with the
younger<00:03:25.010> players<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.579> it's<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.840> think

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
younger players and it's just I think

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.669 
younger players and it's just I think
I've<00:03:27.230> been<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.409> victim<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.889> circumstances
