00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
stove and start to heat this up now over

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.060 
stove and start to heat this up now over
on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> stove<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> turn<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.860> onto

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
on the stove we want to turn it up onto

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
on the stove we want to turn it up onto
a<00:00:53.219> high<00:00:53.489> heat<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.050> going

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a high heat and then what you're going

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
a high heat and then what you're going
to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.010> mix<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.820> these<00:00:56.969> ingredients

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
to do is just mix all these ingredients

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
to do is just mix all these ingredients
together<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> color<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> start<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.250> blend

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
together get the color to start to blend

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
together get the color to start to blend
with<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> sugar<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
with the sugar and what I like to do is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160 
with the sugar and what I like to do is
just<00:01:01.949> sort<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> shake<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> pan<00:01:02.850> around<00:01:03.049> in<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
just sort of shake the pan around in a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.429 
just sort of shake the pan around in a
circular<00:01:04.500> motion<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.580> stir<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
circular motion and just stir like that

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.929 
circular motion and just stir like that
now<00:01:07.439> fortunately<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.100> us<00:01:08.159> our<00:01:08.400> corn<00:01:08.729> will

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
now fortunately for us our corn will

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
now fortunately for us our corn will
start<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.420> pop<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.170> same<00:01:10.409> sort<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
start to pop at the same sort of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
start to pop at the same sort of
temperature<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.220> our<00:01:11.310> caramel<00:01:11.790> starts<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
temperature that our caramel starts to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.649 
temperature that our caramel starts to
form

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
form

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.870 
form
now<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> shake<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> backwards<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.549> forwards

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
now as I shake it backwards and forwards

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.340 
now as I shake it backwards and forwards
we're<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.240> looking<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.780> first<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
we're just looking for the first of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
we're just looking for the first of the
kernels<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> start<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.430> pop<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.330> be

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
kernels to start to pop but do be

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
kernels to start to pop but do be
careful<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.990> you're<00:01:19.200> dealing<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.560> hot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
careful because you're dealing with hot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.149 
careful because you're dealing with hot
sugars<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.400> watch<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.030> splatters<00:01:22.159> now

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
sugars and watch out for splatters now

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
sugars and watch out for splatters now
look<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> first<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.900> popcorn

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
look there is the first little popcorn

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
look there is the first little popcorn
popping<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> kick<00:01:27.299> off

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
popping so I know it's going to kick off

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
popping so I know it's going to kick off
very<00:01:27.750> shortly<00:01:28.170> let's<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.250> our<00:01:29.369> lid<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.640> there

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
very shortly let's get our lid on there

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
very shortly let's get our lid on there
now<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
now and what I'm going to do is just

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
now and what I'm going to do is just
continue<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.880> shake<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> backwards<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
continue to shake this backwards and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
continue to shake this backwards and
forwards<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.860> don't<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> sugars

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
forwards because I don't want the sugars

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
forwards because I don't want the sugars
to<00:01:35.729> burn<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> does<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to burn now it does take a little bit of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
to burn now it does take a little bit of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
burning sometimes it's a good idea to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
burning sometimes it's a good idea to
turn<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> heat<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.640> can

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
