00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
attacking this base even though it's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
attacking this base even though it's
pretty<00:01:04.140> close<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.559> max<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.189> really

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
worried and the good thing about giants

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
worried and the good thing about giants
and<00:01:07.979> healers<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> tells<00:01:08.850> me<00:01:09.000> where<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and healers is it tells me where the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
and healers is it tells me where the
bombs<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.470> there's<00:01:10.650> four<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> them

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
bombs are so there's four of them

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.890 
bombs are so there's four of them
and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> last<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:13.400> never<00:01:14.400> mind<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
and the last one is right never mind I

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.870 
and the last one is right never mind I
guess<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.170> doesn't<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.610> still

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
guess it doesn't do that but it's still

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
guess it doesn't do that but it's still
a<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.689> overpowered<00:01:19.380> attack<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.250> should

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a very overpowered attack and I should

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.300 
a very overpowered attack and I should
have<00:01:20.759> no<00:01:20.970> problem<00:01:21.390> three<00:01:21.659> starting<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> base

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
have no problem three starting this base

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
have no problem three starting this base
now<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> next<00:01:23.759> question<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.720> am<00:01:24.930> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
now the next question is where am I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.679 
now the next question is where am I
going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> attack<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to attack from but the thing is I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.609 
going to attack from but the thing is I
can<00:01:28.340> restart<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> base<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.270> direction

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
can restart this base from any direction

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.370 
can restart this base from any direction
whatsoever<00:01:32.150> because<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.869> attack<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
whatsoever because this this attack is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
whatsoever because this this attack is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to do all the work for me so I'm going

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.929 
to do all the work for me so I'm going
to<00:01:56.850> start<00:01:57.090> by<00:01:57.240> spamming<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> Giants<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.840 
to start by spamming all the Giants and
making<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.659> path<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.229> them

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
making a little path for them

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.480 
making a little path for them
because<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.450> mean<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.950> don't<00:02:04.040> want<00:02:04.250> them<00:02:04.370> to
