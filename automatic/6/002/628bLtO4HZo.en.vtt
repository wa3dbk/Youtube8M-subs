no<00:00:08.730> Maya<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.180> only<00:00:09.330> use<00:00:09.510> techniques<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.560> are

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
no Maya we only use techniques that are

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.040 
no Maya we only use techniques that are
effective<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:12.570> only<00:00:12.750> way<00:00:12.990> to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
effective and the only way to

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.530 
effective and the only way to
demonstrate<00:00:13.910> what<00:00:14.910> techniques<00:00:15.300> are

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
demonstrate what techniques are

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.000 
demonstrate what techniques are
effective<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.320> which<00:00:16.590> ones<00:00:16.770> aren't

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
effective and which ones aren't

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.790 
effective and which ones aren't
effective<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.790> need<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> tool<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:19.439> show

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
effective we need a tool that can show

immediate results so here at mi we go
through<00:00:23.610> and<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:23.939> use<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.200> no<00:00:25.350> lightweight

as you can see he is covered with marks

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.010 
as you can see he is covered with marks
across<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.870> back<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.290> his<00:03:16.380> neck<00:03:16.670> shoulder

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
across the back of his neck shoulder

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.140 
across the back of his neck shoulder
ribcage<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.380> pelvic<00:03:19.830> region<00:03:20.400> across<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
ribcage and pelvic region across the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.300 
ribcage and pelvic region across the

stomach across the bottom of his neck

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.330 
stomach across the bottom of his neck
area<00:03:27.240> so<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.720> looks<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.800> attacker<00:03:29.130> was

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
area so it looks like the attacker was

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.810 
area so it looks like the attacker was
headed<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.820> neck<00:03:31.130> not<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> good<00:03:32.430> thing<00:03:32.760> to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
headed for the neck not a good thing to

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.240 
headed for the neck not a good thing to
be<00:03:33.090> covered<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.750> blood<00:03:33.990> right<00:03:34.170> now<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.980> again<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
be covered in blood right now so again I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.900 
be covered in blood right now so again I
i<00:03:35.760> present<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> out<00:03:37.310> but<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> whole<00:03:38.610> time

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
i present it out but the whole time

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.480 
i present it out but the whole time

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
again on the street attackers are very

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.480 
again on the street attackers are very
fast<00:03:41.820> they<00:03:42.120> don't<00:03:42.870> stand<00:03:43.470> still<00:03:43.830> like<00:03:44.460> a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
fast they don't stand still like a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.920 
fast they don't stand still like a
target<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.060> square<00:03:45.270> range<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.620> idea<00:03:47.010> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
target on a square range the idea of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.840 
target on a square range the idea of
blocking<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.110> attacker<00:03:49.760> stopping<00:03:50.760> your

the pistol it's not going to work may
not<00:03:57.480> be<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.750> best<00:03:57.930> option<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.950> lot<00:03:59.700> of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
not be the best option and a lot of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.180 
not be the best option and a lot of
schools<00:04:00.090> out<00:04:00.270> there<00:04:00.300> or<00:04:00.660> tell<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.050> that<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:02.040> is
