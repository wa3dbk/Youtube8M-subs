00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
pockets keep your thumb sticking out so

the hand doesn't just go straight down
which<00:03:47.519> gives<00:03:47.759> them<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.970> little<00:03:48.120> pop<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.599> the

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
which gives them a little pop in the

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.319 
which gives them a little pop in the
elbow<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.229> creates<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.729> separation

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
elbow and creates a little separation

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.030 
elbow and creates a little separation
here<00:03:51.689> which<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.290> looks<00:03:52.590> great<00:03:52.739> with<00:03:53.009> a

depending<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.919> pose<00:03:59.099> itself<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.759> I<00:04:00.120> love

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
depending on the pose itself and I love

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.479 
depending on the pose itself and I love
having<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> bride<00:04:01.109> lean<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.829> hand<00:04:02.159> on<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
having the bride lean one hand on the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.879 
having the bride lean one hand on the
groom's<00:04:02.759> shoulder<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.989> creates<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.650> lot<00:04:04.829> of

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
groom's shoulder that creates a lot of

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.710 
groom's shoulder that creates a lot of
nice<00:04:05.159> connection<00:04:05.759> between<00:04:05.939> them<00:04:06.239> versus<00:04:06.569> just

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
nice connection between them versus just

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
nice connection between them versus just
standing<00:04:07.139> there<00:04:07.199> next<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.680> each<00:04:07.799> other<00:04:07.949> when<00:04:08.430> I

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
standing there next to each other when I

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.069 
standing there next to each other when I
photograph<00:04:08.939> the<00:04:08.970> couples<00:04:09.509> I<00:04:09.659> try<00:04:10.019> to

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
photograph the couples I try to

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.809 
photograph the couples I try to
incorporate<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.829> background<00:04:11.340> into<00:04:11.699> my

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
incorporate the background into my

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.209 
incorporate the background into my
images<00:04:12.239> versus<00:04:12.810> losing<00:04:13.229> the<00:04:13.530> background<00:04:14.009> with

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
images versus losing the background with

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.370 
images versus losing the background with
light<00:04:14.430> aperture<00:04:14.909> lenses<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.540> think<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.019> creates

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
light aperture lenses I think it creates

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.680 
light aperture lenses I think it creates
a<00:04:16.530> more<00:04:16.829> creative<00:04:17.459> look<00:04:17.669> especially<00:04:18.239> from

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
a more creative look especially from

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.899 
a more creative look especially from
working<00:04:19.049> with<00:04:19.229> very<00:04:19.769> very<00:04:20.130> unique

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
architecture buildings if you look at

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:08.899 
people and I try to create a look

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.499 
people and I try to create a look
that'll<00:05:09.499> work<00:05:09.679> with<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.949> large<00:05:10.279> party<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:11.270> for

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
that'll work with a large party so for

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.510 
that'll work with a large party so for
example<00:05:12.020> if<00:05:12.139> I<00:05:12.289> have<00:05:12.469> steps<00:05:12.889> in<00:05:13.069> front<00:05:13.309> of<00:05:13.399> me

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
example if I have steps in front of me

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.029 
example if I have steps in front of me
that's<00:05:14.059> great<00:05:14.479> because<00:05:14.839> I<00:05:15.050> can<00:05:15.110> divide<00:05:15.680> people

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
that's great because I can divide people

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.730 
that's great because I can divide people
and<00:05:16.430> pose<00:05:16.969> them<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.449> the<00:05:17.990> steps<00:05:18.259> create<00:05:18.709> a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
and pose them on the steps create a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.369 
and pose them on the steps create a
pyramid<00:05:19.369> of<00:05:19.399> people<00:05:19.849> that'll<00:05:20.749> help<00:05:20.930> instead

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
pyramid of people that'll help instead

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.739 
pyramid of people that'll help instead
of<00:05:21.469> creating<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.860> very<00:05:22.219> very<00:05:22.399> wide<00:05:22.969> photo<00:05:23.479> that

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749 
of creating a very very wide photo that

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.809 
of creating a very very wide photo that
just<00:05:23.959> looks<00:05:24.199> too<00:05:24.409> panoramic<00:05:25.069> if<00:05:25.249> I<00:05:25.430> don't<00:05:25.639> have

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
just looks too panoramic if I don't have

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.359 
just looks too panoramic if I don't have
those<00:05:26.029> steps<00:05:26.330> that's<00:05:27.110> fine<00:05:27.439> I<00:05:27.680> can<00:05:28.069> create

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:28.369 
those steps that's fine I can create

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.939 
those steps that's fine I can create
more<00:05:28.819> separation<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.809> the<00:05:29.899> image<00:05:30.319> by<00:05:30.919> using

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
more separation in the image by using

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.549 
more separation in the image by using
off-camera<00:05:31.789> lighting<00:05:32.270> for<00:05:32.779> example<00:05:33.259> in<00:05:33.349> this

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:33.559 
off-camera lighting for example in this

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.519 
off-camera lighting for example in this
photo<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:34.159> use<00:05:34.459> two<00:05:34.759> speed<00:05:35.209> lights<00:05:35.479> or<00:05:35.749> cue

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
flashes I use two cue flashes to

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.350 
flashes I use two cue flashes to
separate<00:05:39.769> everybody<00:05:40.309> and<00:05:40.490> create<00:05:40.729> a<00:05:40.789> little

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
separate everybody and create a little

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.059 
separate everybody and create a little
more<00:05:41.599> edge<00:05:41.869> in<00:05:42.259> the<00:05:42.409> lighting<00:05:42.709> when<00:05:42.949> I'm

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
more edge in the lighting when I'm
