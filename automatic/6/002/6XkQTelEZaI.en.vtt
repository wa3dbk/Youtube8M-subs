right<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.910> I<00:05:54.180> think<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.479> started<00:05:54.780> like<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.260> talk

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
right and I think I started like to talk

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.980 
right and I think I started like to talk
to<00:05:55.680> my<00:05:55.979> stream<00:05:56.340> um<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.880> got<00:05:57.060> my<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.570> monitor

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
to my stream um I got my to monitor

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.140 
to my stream um I got my to monitor
setup<00:05:58.320> and<00:05:58.560> that<00:05:59.070> means<00:05:59.220> like<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.639> have<00:05:59.880> much

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
setup and that means like I have much

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.310 
setup and that means like I have much
more<00:06:00.210> incentive<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:00.780> streaming<00:06:01.020> out<00:06:01.169> because

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
more incentive to streaming out because

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.480 
more incentive to streaming out because
can<00:06:01.410> actually<00:06:01.800> read<00:06:02.010> what<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:02.220> guys<00:06:02.340> are
