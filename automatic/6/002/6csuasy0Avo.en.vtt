00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the changes to the Protoss units here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.290 
the changes to the Protoss units here
and<00:00:15.470> just<00:00:16.470> showing<00:00:16.770> off<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.940> Nate

and just showing off some of the Nate
major<00:00:18.510> changes<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.199> we'll<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.039> into<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
major changes now we'll go into some of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.620 
major changes now we'll go into some of
them<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:20.939> by<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.710> let's<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:23.039> into<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
them one by one here let's go into the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.599 
them one by one here let's go into the
Oracle<00:00:25.140> Oracle's<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> pretty<00:00:25.890> big<00:00:26.160> very

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Oracle Oracle's got a pretty big very

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.769 
Oracle Oracle's got a pretty big very
pretty<00:00:26.849> big<00:00:27.000> change<00:00:27.210> before<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
pretty big change before it was a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.730 
pretty big change before it was a
raising<00:00:28.349> unit<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.699> um<00:00:30.349> basically<00:00:31.349> what's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
raising unit so um basically what's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
raising unit so um basically what's
happened<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.340> no<00:00:32.489> longer<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.850> raising<00:00:33.840> its

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
happened is it's no longer a raising its

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.799 
happened is it's no longer a raising its
no<00:00:34.350> burn<00:00:34.710> unit<00:00:35.130> where<00:00:35.760> you're<00:00:36.210> running<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> in

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
no burn unit where you're running in in

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.030 
no burn unit where you're running in in
your<00:00:37.350> white<00:00:37.590> boat<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:39.660> wipe<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.040> buildings

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
your white boat you wipe out buildings

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.049 
your white boat you wipe out buildings
with<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
with it as you can see it is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
with it as you can see it is
substantially<00:00:42.600> slower<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.170> moving<00:00:43.500> at

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
substantially slower it is not moving at

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
substantially slower it is not moving at
the<00:00:43.710> high<00:00:43.829> rate<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.040> speed<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.430> used<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.420> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the high rate of speed it used to it is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
the high rate of speed it used to it is
still<00:00:45.780> fairly<00:00:46.020> quick<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:46.890> standards

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
still fairly quick by all standards

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.270 
still fairly quick by all standards
however<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.940> drop<00:00:48.899> ship<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.829> quicker

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
however a drop ship is actually quicker

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.650 
however a drop ship is actually quicker
when<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.899> med<00:00:52.020> evac<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.949> quicker

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
when I can med evac is actually quicker

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.000 
when I can med evac is actually quicker
and<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:54.870> can't<00:00:55.140> shoot<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> buildings<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:58.010> one

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and they can't shoot a buildings and one

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.730 
and they can't shoot a buildings and one
does<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.370> survive

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.320 

we're<00:01:04.130> going<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.310> turn<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:04.610> that's<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:05.270> other

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
we're going to turn on that's the other

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.640 
we're going to turn on that's the other
thing<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.600> have<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.780> turn<00:01:05.990> on<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.530> their

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
thing you have to turn on and their

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.160 
thing you have to turn on and their
attack<00:01:06.980> ability<00:01:07.480> it's<00:01:08.480> just<00:01:08.720> on<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.960> bottom

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
attack ability it's just on the bottom

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.020 
attack ability it's just on the bottom
right<00:01:09.230> C<00:01:09.440> or<00:01:09.590> D<00:01:09.650> depending<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.400> we're<00:01:10.880> just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
right C or D depending and we're just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.880 
right C or D depending and we're just
going<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.180> use<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.320> as<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:12.740> can<00:01:12.860> see

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
going to use that and as you can see

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.940 
going to use that and as you can see
they<00:01:13.160> do<00:01:13.220> make<00:01:13.580> short<00:01:13.970> work<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.540> units<00:01:15.410> sorry<00:01:15.890> I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
they do make short work of units sorry I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.290 
they do make short work of units sorry I
stand<00:01:16.160> corrected<00:01:16.250> they<00:01:16.550> do<00:01:16.610> attack<00:01:16.790> buildings

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
stand corrected they do attack buildings

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.920 
stand corrected they do attack buildings
now<00:01:17.450> are<00:01:18.110> still<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.740> our<00:01:19.580> not<00:01:19.850> 50<00:01:20.210> 25<00:01:20.510> damage

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
now are still and our not 50 25 damage

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.100 
now are still and our not 50 25 damage
like<00:01:21.080> before<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:25.480> wow<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:26.690> they<00:01:26.780> burned

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
like before and wow and they burned

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.690 
like before and wow and they burned
through<00:01:27.350> their<00:01:27.410> energy<00:01:27.860> actually<00:01:28.070> wow<00:01:28.400> that's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
through their energy actually wow that's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.820 
through their energy actually wow that's
actually<00:01:28.910> kind<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.300> scary<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.620> can<00:01:30.680> see

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
actually kind of scary so as you can see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.050 
actually kind of scary so as you can see
they<00:01:31.040> are<00:01:31.070> actually<00:01:31.250> fully<00:01:31.520> charged<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.910> think

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
they are actually fully charged I think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.340 
they are actually fully charged I think
when<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.270> started<00:01:32.510> up<00:01:32.660> so<00:01:32.780> they<00:01:32.900> go<00:01:33.170> through

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
when it started up so they go through

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.410 
when it started up so they go through
their<00:01:33.410> energy<00:01:33.770> pretty<00:01:33.980> quickly<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:34.460> i<00:01:35.060> would

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
their energy pretty quickly so i would

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.840 
their energy pretty quickly so i would
say<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:35.810> they're<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.260> best<00:01:36.680> raising<00:01:37.520> unit

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
say that they're the best raising unit

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.330 
say that they're the best raising unit
out<00:01:37.970> there<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:38.420> uh<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.930> mean<00:01:39.500> they<00:01:39.650> do<00:01:39.710> do<00:01:40.130> some

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
out there but uh I mean they do do some

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.859 
out there but uh I mean they do do some
damage<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.970> you're<00:01:41.180> not<00:01:41.300> as<00:01:41.420> potent<00:01:41.720> as<00:01:41.780> they

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
damage just you're not as potent as they

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.590 
damage just you're not as potent as they
used<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.170> do<00:01:42.229> they<00:01:42.260> do<00:01:42.410> look<00:01:42.710> great<00:01:42.950> on<00:01:43.250> workers

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
used to do they do look great on workers

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.840 
used to do they do look great on workers
we're<00:01:44.600> going<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.470> get<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.860> hot<00:01:46.130> county<00:01:46.580> here

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
we're going to get the hot county here

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.800 
we're going to get the hot county here
so<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.930> get<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.200> over<00:01:48.440> there<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.420> we<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.780> a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
so we get on over there and we do have a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.130 
so we get on over there and we do have a
void<00:01:51.170> rays<00:01:51.380> no<00:01:51.619> flavor<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.160> do<00:01:53.140> basically

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
void rays no flavor as you do basically

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.480 
void rays no flavor as you do basically
how<00:01:54.260> it<00:01:54.320> works<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.800> use<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.280> prismatic

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
how it works is you use the prismatic

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.430 
how it works is you use the prismatic
alignment<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.360> basically<00:01:56.840> pumps<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:57.290> up

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
alignment and basically pumps them up

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.980 
alignment and basically pumps them up
and<00:01:57.890> they<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.310> get<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.640> bonus<00:01:58.910> against<00:01:59.450> massive

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and they do get a bonus against massive

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.130 
and they do get a bonus against massive
sorry<00:02:00.560> against<00:02:00.770> armored<00:02:01.160> units<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.750> it's<00:02:02.750> got

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
sorry against armored units and it's got

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710 
sorry against armored units and it's got
a<00:02:03.170> 60<00:02:03.500> second<00:02:03.860> cooldown<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.510> kind

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
a 60 second cooldown on it so you kind

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.910 
a 60 second cooldown on it so you kind
of<00:02:05.810> got<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.050> hit<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.229> right<00:02:06.500> as<00:02:06.680> you're<00:02:06.800> doing

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
of got to hit it right as you're doing

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.889 
of got to hit it right as you're doing
the<00:02:07.100> attack<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.729> there<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.300> something<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.720> can

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899

shoot and they're already charged as you
can<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:13.010> rip<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.580> nice<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:13.880> quick

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
can see and they rip in nice and quick

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.550 
can see and they rip in nice and quick
it's<00:02:15.710> only<00:02:16.130> good<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.430> 60<00:02:16.910> seconds<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.380> got

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
it's only good for 60 seconds so you got

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.100 
it's only good for 60 seconds so you got
to<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.340> count<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:21.080> now

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
to kind of make this count right now

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.040 
to kind of make this count right now
there<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:22.340> shoot<00:02:22.610> there<00:02:22.820> plus<00:02:23.150> six<00:02:23.510> against

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
there is shoot there plus six against

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.490 
there is shoot there plus six against
against<00:02:24.680> armored<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:25.720> only<00:02:26.720> against<00:02:27.230> armored

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
against armored so only against armored

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.780 
against armored so only against armored
and<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.740> can<00:02:27.860> see<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.100> cools<00:02:28.340> down<00:02:28.460> pretty

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and as you can see it cools down pretty

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.949 
and as you can see it cools down pretty
long<00:02:29.510> cooldown<00:02:29.750> on

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
long cooldown on

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.970 
long cooldown on
let's<00:02:31.959> see<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.319> charges<00:02:32.709> up<00:02:32.830> on

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
let's see if it's charges up on

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.750 
let's see if it's charges up on
buildings<00:02:34.500> no<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.739> does<00:02:35.920> not<00:02:36.069> charge<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.640> on

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
buildings no it does not charge up on

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.910 
buildings no it does not charge up on
buildings<00:02:37.120> anymore<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.959> right<00:02:38.470> now<00:02:38.500> they're

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
buildings anymore so right now they're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.940 
buildings anymore so right now they're
only<00:02:39.010> doing<00:02:39.190> 13<00:02:39.700> with<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.660> bonus<00:02:41.020> they<00:02:41.800> will

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
only doing 13 with the bonus they will

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.380 
only doing 13 with the bonus they will
get<00:02:42.130> more<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:42.970> there's<00:02:43.120> still<00:02:43.180> blood

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
get more so but there's still blood

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.839 
get more so but there's still blood
pooling<00:02:43.720> they're<00:02:43.989> just<00:02:44.170> not<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.400> they'll<00:02:45.400> hang

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
two weapons so the resonance coil which

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.199 
two weapons so the resonance coil which
is<00:03:20.290> for<00:03:20.440> their<00:03:20.560> ground<00:03:20.830> kinetic<00:03:21.790> overload

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
is for their ground kinetic overload

air targets gets a 75 bonus against
ground<00:03:28.239> there<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.450> no<00:03:28.569> bonus<00:03:29.080> right<00:03:29.230> now

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
ground there is no bonus right now

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.380 
ground there is no bonus right now
they're<00:03:29.560> doing<00:03:29.739> 39<00:03:30.160> damage<00:03:30.489> stock<00:03:30.730> they<00:03:30.910> do<00:03:30.970> 30

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
they're doing 39 damage stock they do 30

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.650 
they're doing 39 damage stock they do 30
so<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.380> not<00:03:32.530> super<00:03:33.459> bad<00:03:33.670> let's<00:03:34.450> see<00:03:34.600> if

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
so it's not super bad let's see if

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.819 
so it's not super bad let's see if
there's<00:03:34.840> anything<00:03:35.079> around<00:03:35.290> here<00:03:35.560> that's

there's anything around here that's

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.440 
there's anything around here that's
considered<00:03:36.250> massive<00:03:36.790> maybe<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.090> pile<00:03:37.269> of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
considered massive maybe this pile of

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.730 
considered massive maybe this pile of
rocks<00:03:37.829> no<00:03:38.829> it's<00:03:38.980> an<00:03:39.070> armored<00:03:39.340> structure<00:03:39.820> and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.130 

I<00:03:44.800> know<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:45.910> don't<00:03:46.030> want<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.510> because<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:46.930> want

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
I know we don't want to because we want

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.260 
I know we don't want to because we want
to<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.350> some<00:03:47.530> stuff<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.520> computer<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.240> is

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
to do some stuff the computer it is

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.620 
to do some stuff the computer it is
going<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.870> try<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.170> quit<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.680> me<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.220> guessing

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
going to try and quit on me and guessing

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.180 
going to try and quit on me and guessing
we'll<00:03:52.630> say<00:03:52.810> see<00:03:52.870> tempest<00:03:53.500> roll<00:03:53.770> into<00:03:54.070> their

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
we'll say see tempest roll into their

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.700 
we'll say see tempest roll into their
base<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:55.570> have<00:03:55.720> no<00:03:55.900> workers<00:03:56.410> they're

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
base and they have no workers they're

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.870 
base and they have no workers they're
kind<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.250> screwed<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:59.410> if<00:03:59.500> there<00:03:59.680> is

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
kind of it I screwed so see if there is

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.050 
kind of it I screwed so see if there is
something<00:04:00.880> over<00:04:01.210> here<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.390> could<00:04:01.630> shoot<00:04:01.840> at<00:04:03.060> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
something over here I could shoot at and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.310 
something over here I could shoot at and
you<00:04:04.450> can<00:04:04.570> see<00:04:04.690> they're<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:04.960> all<00:04:05.260> that

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
you can see they're not all that

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.560 
you can see they're not all that
powerful<00:04:05.980> there<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.430> still<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.850> same<00:04:06.880> kind<00:04:07.480> of

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
powerful there is still the same kind of

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.760 
powerful there is still the same kind of
unit<00:04:07.840> but<00:04:08.020> it<00:04:08.200> was<00:04:08.350> supposed<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.590> be<00:04:08.650> good

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
unit but it was supposed to be good

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.770 
unit but it was supposed to be good
against<00:04:09.010> Madison<00:04:09.340> unit<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:09.760> against<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.630> lot

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
against Madison unit so against a lot

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.240 
against Madison unit so against a lot
ultralisk<00:04:11.230> eyes<00:04:11.440> you'll<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.830> someone<00:04:12.100> no

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
ultralisk eyes you'll have someone no

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.540 
ultralisk eyes you'll have someone no
problems<00:04:12.610> with<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.930> big<00:04:13.930> one<00:04:14.170> is<00:04:14.400> let's<00:04:15.400> just

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
problems with that big one is let's just

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.940 
problems with that big one is let's just
grab<00:04:15.730> everything<00:04:16.590> one<00:04:17.590> thing<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.799> do<00:04:17.860> like

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
grab everything one thing I do like

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.050 
grab everything one thing I do like
about<00:04:18.100> heart<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.549> swarm<00:04:18.730> just<00:04:19.000> by

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
about heart of the swarm just by

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.940 
about heart of the swarm just by
pressing<00:04:19.209> f2<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.870> can<00:04:19.989> grab<00:04:20.140> all<00:04:20.350> your<00:04:20.530> units

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
pressing f2 you can grab all your units

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.430 
pressing f2 you can grab all your units
and<00:04:21.420> just<00:04:22.420> basically<00:04:22.510> command<00:04:23.080> them<00:04:23.200> all<00:04:23.320> at

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
and just basically command them all at

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.530 
and just basically command them all at
once<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.770> grabs<00:04:24.040> only<00:04:24.460> your<00:04:24.700> offensive<00:04:25.240> units

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
once it grabs only your offensive units

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.820 
once it grabs only your offensive units
so<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.350> will<00:04:26.500> leave<00:04:26.650> workers<00:04:27.070> blind<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.830> there

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
so it will leave workers blind and there

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.820 
so it will leave workers blind and there
we<00:04:30.070> go<00:04:30.250> now<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.630> recall<00:04:32.050> works<00:04:32.320> exactly<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
we go now the recall works exactly the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.800 
we go now the recall works exactly the
same<00:04:32.920> instead<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.400> being<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.700> rico<00:04:34.030> forward<00:04:34.600> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
same instead of being a rico forward it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.620 
same instead of being a rico forward it
is<00:04:34.990> only<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.290> recall<00:04:35.740> back<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:36.370> by<00:04:37.090> using<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
is only a recall back so by using the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.170 
is only a recall back so by using the
recall<00:04:38.050> ability<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:39.310> can<00:04:39.340> recall<00:04:39.850> all<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
recall ability you can recall all the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.940 
recall ability you can recall all the
forces<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.600> are<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.990> area<00:04:41.140> over<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
forces that are in the area over to the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.740 
forces that are in the area over to the
nearest<00:04:42.160> nexus<00:04:42.610> 4nexus<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:43.180> click<00:04:43.390> on<00:04:43.510> rather

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
nearest nexus 4nexus you click on rather

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.260 
nearest nexus 4nexus you click on rather
and<00:04:44.220> that's<00:04:45.220> basically<00:04:45.610> about<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.030> gist<00:04:46.180> of

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
and that's basically about the gist of

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.910 
and that's basically about the gist of
it<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:46.540> as<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.720> can<00:04:46.810> see<00:04:46.990> those<00:04:47.650> are<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.830> big

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
it so as you can see those are the big

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.280 
it so as you can see those are the big
ones<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.370> prismatic<00:04:48.670> beam<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> pretty<00:04:50.080> big

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
ones a prismatic beam is a pretty big

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.490 
ones a prismatic beam is a pretty big
change<00:04:50.910> tempest<00:04:51.910> okay<00:04:52.450> yeah<00:04:52.660> fleet<00:04:52.990> beacon<00:04:53.320> is

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
change tempest okay yeah fleet beacon is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.340 
change tempest okay yeah fleet beacon is
a<00:04:53.530> problem<00:04:53.980> so<00:04:54.160> it's<00:04:54.310> no<00:04:54.430> longer<00:04:54.460> like<00:04:55.350> it's

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
a problem so it's no longer like it's

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.740 
a problem so it's no longer like it's
not<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.530> mid-game<00:04:57.190> unit<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.240> still<00:04:58.480> have<00:04:58.570> you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
not a mid-game unit you still have you

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.450 
not a mid-game unit you still have you
have<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.050> get<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.170> free<00:04:59.380> beacon<00:04:59.680> as<00:04:59.830> well<00:05:00.010> as<00:05:00.220> the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
have to get a free beacon as well as the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.380 
have to get a free beacon as well as the
the<00:05:02.250> Stargate<00:05:03.250> as<00:05:03.370> well<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:03.850> kind<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.270> a

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
the Stargate as well so kind of a

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.810 
the Stargate as well so kind of a
trade-off<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.110> way<00:05:05.500> Oracle<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.610> nice

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
trade-off that way Oracle is nice

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.490 
trade-off that way Oracle is nice
however<00:05:07.090> keep<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.480> mind<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.840> energy<00:05:08.350> does

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
however keep in mind that energy does

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.960 
however keep in mind that energy does
burn<00:05:08.740> through<00:05:09.010> let's<00:05:09.190> just<00:05:09.400> grab<00:05:09.580> these<00:05:09.730> guys

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
burn through let's just grab these guys

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.530 
burn through let's just grab these guys
who<00:05:10.240> still<00:05:10.450> do<00:05:10.800> against<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:12.610> structure<00:05:13.300> here

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
who still do against this structure here

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.670 
who still do against this structure here
and<00:05:13.780> see<00:05:13.870> how<00:05:13.930> long<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.200> takes<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.500> them<00:05:14.590> to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and see how long it takes for them to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.480 
and see how long it takes for them to
burn<00:05:14.920> it<00:05:15.070> down<00:05:15.100> we<00:05:16.920> Paula<00:05:17.920> Marines<00:05:18.220> are<00:05:18.340> going

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
burn it down we Paula Marines are going

I've<00:05:20.020> got<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.170> lot<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.530> shields<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.310> they're

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
I've got a lot of shields and they're

I've got a lot of shields and they're
going<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.790> be<00:05:21.880> flying<00:05:22.170> alright<00:05:23.170> so<00:05:23.320> we<00:05:23.440> do<00:05:23.530> have

going to be flying alright so we do have
a<00:05:23.710> lot<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.950> units<00:05:24.250> here<00:05:24.430> let's<00:05:25.120> just<00:05:25.300> turn

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
a lot of units here let's just turn

how long it takes for them to burn
through<00:05:34.060> all<00:05:34.210> this<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:34.720> expend<00:05:35.260> all<00:05:35.380> over

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
quickly and through that very nice job

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.800 
quickly and through that very nice job
there<00:05:42.610> let's<00:05:42.970> really<00:05:43.120> see<00:05:43.330> them<00:05:43.420> work<00:05:43.570> on<00:05:43.690> the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
there let's really see them work on the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.260 
there let's really see them work on the
building<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:45.400> building<00:05:45.760> is<00:05:45.880> going<00:05:46.060> pretty

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
building the building is going pretty

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.490 
building the building is going pretty
good<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:46.570> they're<00:05:46.840> actually<00:05:46.990> with<00:05:47.260> a<00:05:47.290> lot<00:05:47.470> of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
good so they're actually with a lot of

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.000 
good so they're actually with a lot of
energy<00:05:47.740> they<00:05:48.070> are<00:05:48.160> not<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:48.760> bad<00:05:49.590> they<00:05:50.590> do<00:05:50.650> take

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
energy they are not so bad they do take

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.760 
energy they are not so bad they do take
a<00:05:51.040> little<00:05:51.280> bit<00:05:51.430> more<00:05:51.550> time<00:05:51.790> than<00:05:51.970> before<00:05:52.770> to

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
a little bit more time than before to

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.980 
a little bit more time than before to
kill<00:05:54.010> a<00:05:54.280> structure<00:05:55.090> such<00:05:55.270> as<00:05:55.300> art<00:05:55.930> and

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
kill a structure such as art and

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.590 
kill a structure such as art and
structure<00:05:56.350> like<00:05:56.520> command<00:05:57.520> center<00:05:57.790> but

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
structure like command center but

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.000 
structure like command center but
against<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.960> softer<00:05:59.290> stuff<00:05:59.470> it's<00:05:59.650> not<00:05:59.740> so<00:05:59.860> bad

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
against the softer stuff it's not so bad

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.410 
against the softer stuff it's not so bad
and<00:06:01.860> they<00:06:02.860> are<00:06:03.040> now<00:06:03.220> out<00:06:03.610> of<00:06:03.670> energy<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.360> the

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
and they are now out of energy for the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.380 
and they are now out of energy for the
most<00:06:04.600> part<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.050> that's<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.390> that's

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
most part and that's it so that's

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.910
