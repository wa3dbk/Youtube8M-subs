00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the first one that my school suggested

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340 
the first one that my school suggested
was<00:01:50.100> nursing<00:01:50.640> diagnosis<00:01:51.210> handbook<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
reason why I like this one and also it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
reason why I like this one and also it's
by<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:55.130> betty<00:01:56.130> j<00:01:56.369> Ackley<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> Gail<00:01:57.119> Pete<00:01:57.329> lab

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.980 
by a betty j Ackley and Gail Pete lab
league<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.860> those

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
league and for those

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.700 
league and for those
it's<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.700> publisher<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:03.259> reason<00:02:03.409> why<00:02:03.649> I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
it's the publisher so the reason why I

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.889 
it's the publisher so the reason why I
kind<00:02:04.189> of<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.640> one<00:02:04.850> first<00:02:05.119> off<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.509> has<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
kind of like this one first off it has a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.949 
kind of like this one first off it has a
whole<00:02:06.170> lot<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.490> information<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.810> looks

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
whole lot of information in it it looks

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.600 
whole lot of information in it it looks
it<00:02:09.349> looks<00:02:09.410> kind<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.800> small<00:02:09.920> compared<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.520> that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it looks kind of small compared to that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.729 
it looks kind of small compared to that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
already own the book if you want to look

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.559 
already own the book if you want to look
at<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.300> certain<00:02:29.569> nursing<00:02:29.930> diagnosis<00:02:30.470> um<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
at a certain nursing diagnosis um the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.750 
at a certain nursing diagnosis um the
reason<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.049> don't<00:02:33.140> like<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.890> book<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.430> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
reason I don't like this book is that it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
reason I don't like this book is that it
can<00:02:34.940> be<00:02:35.090> very<00:02:35.410> complicated<00:02:36.410> like<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:38.200> it's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
can be very complicated like it's it's

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.380 
can be very complicated like it's it's
hard<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:39.830> for<00:02:40.069> first<00:02:40.459> semester<00:02:40.670> students

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
hard I think for first semester students

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.070 
hard I think for first semester students
to<00:02:41.540> use<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:43.670> you're<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.840> learning

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
to use this because you're just learning

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.680 
to use this because you're just learning
about<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.530> staff<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.220> just<00:02:46.600> doesn't<00:02:47.600> make

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
about the staff and it just doesn't make

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.199 
about the staff and it just doesn't make
a<00:02:47.750> whole<00:02:47.840> lot<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.140> sense<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.640> mean<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.030> does

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
a whole lot of sense so I mean it does

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.240 
a whole lot of sense so I mean it does
make<00:02:50.390> sense<00:02:50.540> once<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.049> get<00:02:51.290> into<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
make sense once you get into it but I

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
make sense once you get into it but I
when<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:52.970> first<00:02:53.150> got<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.630> was<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.810> wow

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
when I first got this I was like wow

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.680 
when I first got this I was like wow
that<00:02:54.410> crap<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.100> doesn't<00:02:55.430> make<00:02:55.580> any<00:02:55.640> sense<00:02:55.940> so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
that crap this doesn't make any sense so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.479 
that crap this doesn't make any sense so
that's<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.650> other<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.280> my

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
going to do it in actual sections

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.950 
going to do it in actual sections
instead<00:06:06.830> of<00:06:07.330> doing<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.419> whole<00:06:08.450> thing<00:06:08.810> in<00:06:08.930> one

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960

instead of doing the whole thing in one
video<00:06:09.260> because<00:06:09.620> that's<00:06:09.800> just<00:06:10.039> gonna<00:06:10.220> be<00:06:10.310> long

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030
