00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
jokes read Pierre dragons to get the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.760 
jokes read Pierre dragons to get the
legendary<00:01:11.890> one<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.460> um<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.990> exactly<00:01:14.500> what

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
legendary one so um that's exactly what

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.820 
legendary one so um that's exactly what
i<00:01:14.800> use<00:01:15.160> but<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:16.090> dragon<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.720> basically<00:01:17.620> a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
i use but this dragon is basically a

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.580 
i use but this dragon is basically a
time-based<00:01:18.610> dragon<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.240> I'm<00:01:19.720> assuming<00:01:19.990> that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
time-based dragon so I'm assuming that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.880 
time-based dragon so I'm assuming that
the<00:01:21.310> story<00:01:21.970> behind<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.690> dragon<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.410> he

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
the story behind this dragon is that he

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.120 
the story behind this dragon is that he
is<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.070> time<00:01:24.520> traveler<00:01:24.960> anywho<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.200> have<00:01:26.860> used

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
is a time traveler anywho I have used

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.570 
is a time traveler anywho I have used
the<00:01:27.430> pure<00:01:27.880> metal<00:01:28.330> dragon<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.100> appeared<00:01:30.100> dark

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
the pure metal dragon and appeared dark

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.000 
the pure metal dragon and appeared dark
dragon<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.360> get<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:31.720> dragon<00:01:32.260> now<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.890> there

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
dragon to get this dragon now is there

dragon to get this dragon now is there
other<00:01:33.160> combinations<00:01:33.880> out<00:01:33.970> there<00:01:34.150> yeah

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
other combinations out there yeah

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.860 
other combinations out there yeah
there's<00:01:35.050> probably<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.530> ton<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:35.920> combinations

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
there's probably a ton of combinations

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870 
there's probably a ton of combinations
but<00:01:37.870> it'll<00:01:38.500> probably<00:01:38.770> take<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.370> while<00:01:39.580> to

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
but it'll probably take you a while to
