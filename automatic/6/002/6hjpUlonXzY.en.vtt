 because I was in sneakers and today I go 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.090
 available in the online kraft application 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.090
 online service forceps 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.680
 in 2006 the break 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.780
 so it can have support that can be 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.150
 followed or something similar 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.960

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.310
 English harry potter who is watching 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.849
 which already had on several varieties already 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.849

 one thing is possible to use 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:33.720

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.720
 she missed the goal 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.069
