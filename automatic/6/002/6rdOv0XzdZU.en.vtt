00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.730
 we have new genesis treatments with 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.350
 important news some new 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.990
 images that we had not seen 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 previously if the manager's boy 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.560
 of the edition or me inside the mouse 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.970
 do not make a mistake here you have to leave 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.820
 one of the new law cards of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.860
 information that can take you to the video 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.290
 initial that we made about the analysis 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.930
 of the first trailer of terminator genesis 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.850
 now we go with the new images that 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.800
 we have found more interesting 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.360
 directly to them starting with the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 news of the final trailer of 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.440
 terminator genesis we have to talk about 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.900
 doomsday the much-vaunted 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.730
 moment in which skynet takes control 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.800
 and the offensive against the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.870
 humanity is portrayed in a couple of 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.390
 scenes that really are very very 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.790
 chulas very accomplished as you see in the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.079
 images we continue with the moment 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.190
 comedian of arnold and is that 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.780
 I inevitably have to laugh watching 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.449
 we had already contemplated in these 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 You're the good guy by Arnold Schwarzenegger 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.940
 although here the sphere has surprised us 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.729
 it's like that sarah connor says I'm 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.560
 trying to integrate and its action 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.340
 yesterday put this cart that you see in 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.780
 total epic screen ends with Sara 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.250
 saying I know what I know you have to polish it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.479
 these points of humor can come very 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 well to the movie and is that the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.820
 autoparodia is never over john 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.830
 connor the tape seems to not only have 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.450
 puzzling temporal paradoxes 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.399
 but also because of what we have seen 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 in this final trailer jon color could 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.580
 not being human or being half human half 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 machine or knowingly leaves us with the intrigue 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.710
 of it will end up being even good or 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 bad and to finish of course action 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 and more action iconic motorcycles in the saga 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.360
 buses flying and it's that all this does not 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.619
 may be missing in all the good movie 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 Terminator self - respecting 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.420
 I am a baby has been all 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.310
 if you like you subscribed you will have more 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.500
 videos of this saga and especially the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 criticized movie when you go out to the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160
 next video 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.470
 two
