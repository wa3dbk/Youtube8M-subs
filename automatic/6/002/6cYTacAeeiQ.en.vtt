00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.800
 hello everyone with you veike is our 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.130
 regular skyrim mod 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.590
 In general, this mode is about magic 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.399
 or rather, no, it’s not likely to 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.100
 this is an ability called 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.070
 relocation this ability is in 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.980
 magic change 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.280
 called she moved to move here 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.840
 and move the main and the test is in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.600
 general let's start with the main atoms in 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.280
 you 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.489
 what else should okay let's test 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.489
 at 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.770
 another thing which is just here 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.520
 it costs her an animation just to stand and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.690
 do nothing and not get out of it 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:18.860
 sea ​​and so I understand how to get out of it 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:22.010
 fashion horror just in this fashion 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.900
 there was talk about what you can do and 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.110
 where you character inventory 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.549
 moved now do not understand how it is 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.340
 do here in general i got out of maine and 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.799
 try to move right now that's fun winter 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 It does not work for us and the test should 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:45.920
 work here in general we are for the winter and here you are 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:54.710
 finally manage our own 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:02:00.320
 you can't do a sprint why you 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.619
 fly nazim fall to the ground so here 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.040
 we see ourselves, plus everything, you can 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.040
 do 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.629
 You can sketch out his character 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.180
 here for example right now, show it to the action 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.890
 move nasim 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.890
 then take the cleaned thin 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.739
 character and for example and remove such 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.560
 beautiful frame art stands there and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.690
 cameras it passes through it afterwards 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.099
 slow down there in adobe likeness or 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.220
 least in sony vegas and however 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.810
 further here somehow thought right away if 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 You can really move in this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 then you can move to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.160
 Jarl himself, I now wondered why 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.380
 No, it would be cool if this mod 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.230
 added the fact that when we land in 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.080
 people we can safely go into their 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.030
 house and brothers things by the way it was 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.260
 It is indicated that this can be done but for now 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.500
 I never see this in general 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:21.650
 Earl let me wanna come hallak mansions 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:28.450
 yarla general here is our yar our yar again 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:33.760
 flies cool in general then so 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:37.910
 let's go all the same into a fight not limit anyone 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.480
 that is, you can simply use about as 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.760
 the camera is probably the best way 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.160
 use this mod because he 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.489
 nothing special does that 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.799
 there we can not take for example go 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.230
 Plowman vision character here here 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.239
 the guards have such as 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.850
 ability that they just stand they 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.569
 do nothing i can not and nothing 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.090
 do u even 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.090
 microphone closer to the keyboard I will substitute 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.510
 they do nothing when they press on 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.569
 also happens very much though it should 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.729
