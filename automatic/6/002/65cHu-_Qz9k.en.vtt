00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the front which I think sounds a lot

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.310 
the front which I think sounds a lot
better<00:01:57.869> than<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.649> original<00:01:59.040> iPhone<00:01:59.159> design

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
better than the original iPhone design

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.609 
better than the original iPhone design
on<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> bottom<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.390> four<00:02:04.170> LEDs

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
on the bottom here you have four LEDs

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230 
on the bottom here you have four LEDs
that<00:02:04.649> show<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.369> charge<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.759> left<00:02:05.880> in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that show you how much charge is left in

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
that show you how much charge is left in
the<00:02:06.329> case<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> right<00:02:07.950> side<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> have

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the case on the right side here you have

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.880 
the case on the right side here you have
the<00:02:09.060> sync<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.690> charge<00:02:09.770> port

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.710 

then<00:02:13.250> over<00:02:13.460> here<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.450> switch

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
then over here you have a little switch

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.900 
then over here you have a little switch
this<00:02:15.350> lets<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.650> use<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.040> case<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.850> a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
this lets you use the case as just a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
this lets you use the case as just a
case<00:02:17.090> by<00:02:17.300> itself<00:02:17.630> or<00:02:18.260> when<00:02:18.620> you're<00:02:18.740> ready<00:02:18.890> to

case by itself or when you're ready to
start<00:02:19.250> charging<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.819> flip<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.180> switch<00:02:20.209> down

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
start charging you flip the switch down

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.020 
start charging you flip the switch down
and<00:02:20.980> there<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.069> go<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.520> phone<00:02:22.700> will<00:02:22.880> start

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
and there you go your phone will start

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.470 
and there you go your phone will start
charging<00:02:23.530> now<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.709> case<00:02:25.069> does<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.640> 1500

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
charging now this case does have a 1500

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480 
charging now this case does have a 1500
milliamp<00:02:26.870> battery<00:02:27.010> which<00:02:28.010> means<00:02:28.280> absolutely

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
milliamp battery which means absolutely

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
I'm going to give you a real-world

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.870 
I'm going to give you a real-world
experience<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.440> had<00:02:33.890> my<00:02:34.070> phone<00:02:34.280> drained<00:02:34.700> all

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
experience I had my phone drained all

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.850 
experience I had my phone drained all
the<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.060> down<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.390> zero<00:02:35.660> when<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.410> turn<00:02:36.709> this

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the way down to zero when I turn this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 
the way down to zero when I turn this
case<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.730> charged<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.690> all<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> way<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
case on it charged it all the way up to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.580 
case on it charged it all the way up to
75%<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.300> not<00:02:41.420> going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.020> full

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
75% so it's not going to do a full

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.350 
75% so it's not going to do a full
charge<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.340> it'll<00:02:43.550> charge<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.940> enough<00:02:44.209> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
charge but it'll charge it enough to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.330 
charge but it'll charge it enough to
where<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.930> know<00:02:45.050> if<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.800> need<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.130> home

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
where you know if you need to get home

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.460 
where you know if you need to get home
and<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> charge<00:02:47.480> you'll<00:02:47.930> make<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.260> just

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
and then do a charge you'll make it just

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.710 
and then do a charge you'll make it just
fine<00:02:48.970> as<00:02:49.970> far<00:02:50.150> as<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.330> lay<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> table

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
fine as far as the lay on the table

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.410 
fine as far as the lay on the table
design<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.620> doesn't<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.100> very<00:02:52.340> much<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:52.910> you

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
design it doesn't have very much so you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.580 
design it doesn't have very much so you
know<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.570> wouldn't<00:02:53.780> trust<00:02:53.989> laying<00:02:54.230> your<00:02:54.380> phone

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
know I wouldn't trust laying your phone

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.350 
know I wouldn't trust laying your phone
down<00:02:54.800> like<00:02:55.040> that

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
down like that

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.509 
down like that
as<00:02:56.600> far<00:02:56.930> as<00:02:56.959> drop<00:02:57.290> protection<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:58.160> know<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
as far as drop protection you know it is

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.460 
as far as drop protection you know it is
a<00:02:58.550> really<00:02:58.850> thick<00:02:59.239> case<00:02:59.540> that's<00:02:59.900> probably<00:03:00.320> one

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
a really thick case that's probably one

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.070 
a really thick case that's probably one
of<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.650> minuses<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:02.750> thick

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of the minuses is that it's really thick

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.930 
of the minuses is that it's really thick
and<00:03:03.110> add<00:03:03.530> some<00:03:03.890> bolt<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.310> iPhone<00:03:04.640> which<00:03:04.820> is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and add some bolt to the iPhone which is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.690 
and add some bolt to the iPhone which is
already<00:03:05.120> slim<00:03:05.800> but<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.920> does<00:03:07.070> add<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.459> drop

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
already slim but it does add that drop

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.880 
already slim but it does add that drop
protection<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.450> if<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.110> were<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.350> drop<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.739> I

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
protection so if I were to drop this I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.180 
protection so if I were to drop this I
would<00:03:10.160> feel<00:03:10.370> okay<00:03:10.700> okay<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.470> thanks<00:03:13.070> for
