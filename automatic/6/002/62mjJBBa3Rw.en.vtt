00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.680
 the garbage cans there and there 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.680
 and then we do it differently 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:38.969
 namely , the easy way then build 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 it this way the way to go then the road 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.670
 ding complex it's good course here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.670
 somehow a chancellor 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.129
 ok so now but the away then we would have 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.969
 Definitely again 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.660
 little space for this purpose a few things 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.260
 the garbage can do it again 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.790
 here from the stadium is in four places 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 there is the diner where you can get fast 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 you can feed when you 're at it 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.540
 get away and we still have one 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.310
 has little bigger space for 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 Any new buildings are just us 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.650
 so she is expected in the near future 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 also finished and then look again 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.900
 to buy the eschatology consumerism 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 business in dry the money from the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.829
 to pull bag 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 yes then we just do it and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.720
 Build a quickie market here 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 down 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.869
 The business counts so take 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.869
 simply quickie market ever 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.640
 and because it is so beautiful and me 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 However, we still do it in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.820
 restaurant 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.530
 then we will have it soon 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.120
 due but still 13,000 can 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.680
 Quasi relatively quickly build something or else 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.620
 react relatively quickly if still 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.629
 any buildings are coming to us 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 and yes, I would just go now 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.430
 the people always on the tasks 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.599
 years or what is already tonight 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.060
 noon where I go tonight 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.829
 are 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:46.379
 some immediately 24 hours gave it up 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.040
 well worth it so how do you like mine 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.290
 season 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.060
 That's why the schoolyard needs an ecosystem 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.790
 bats types the behavior of the current 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.590
 must be offered 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.180
 Report that even if it's okay that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.620
 is so a shit so money 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.409
 now you want the house 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.329
 to build 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:11.129
 people that must shit now that 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.780
 I'm just waiting for a puke 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:20.940
 I should probably just it 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:24.180
 exactly what will happen to me 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.430
 not again in this strange situation 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.000
 come that is in hindsight 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.079
 is displayed but he has too 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.370
 just the exclamation point that 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.569
 faded in as have you back then 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 you would not have that before 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:42.030
 Well , well, now is just stupid run 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.959
 have and would not have seen so 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.109
 no longer creates before 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:50.370
 bowtie prefabricated as well maybe 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.490
 work out if possible the day after tomorrow 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.560
 stash 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.320
 Well, I do my episode and then that 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.280
 Children want to build things before 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.290
 instruct what he has to do with it fell 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.440
 that also properly continue the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.250
 whole thing and that works as well 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
 we left that 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.650
 but there just trust that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:29.160
 he can do that while I'm in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:30.390
 bulgaria martin in which now the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.910
 have to build racquet types 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.500
 alexey petrov it could be me 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.540
 that it barely had touched rich 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.090
 because he has finished playing his loud 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.800
 and in seconds 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.090
 that can be natural but no matter what 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.440
 Worth doing here for our stars 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:52.170
 can not hurt a bit either 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:55.380
 more money money and experience yes 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.460
 have well weigh more and even indeed 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.100
 That's not why it is not quite so 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.540
 tragically it's a bit annoying 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:10.950
 You could have finished that now 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:13.130
 But maybe you would be me then 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.830
 through the people to send tasks 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.700
 and I would be full for this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.070
 say goodbye and see you at 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.570
 Next time we will be there 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.850
 hopefully enough money around the house 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.500
 to build something, of course, somehow 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.960
 40,000 costs me a bit 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.960
 Well, that's the job
