00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.170 
applies to the the motion I'm not really
sure<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.890> mean<00:01:37.130> are<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.520> talking<00:01:37.820> about

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.750 

Oh

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.960 

or<00:01:46.760> I'm<00:01:47.470> kind<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.650> movement<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:51.970> mix

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
or I'm kind of a movement like this mix

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.660 
or I'm kind of a movement like this mix
with<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:56.050> fully<00:01:57.050> understand<00:01:57.500> because<00:01:57.920> I've

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
with this fully understand because I've

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.600 
with this fully understand because I've
heard<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.940> lot<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.720> lot<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.230> guitar

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
heard a lot of a lot of guitar

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.220 
heard a lot of a lot of guitar
instructors<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.820> people<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.110> can

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
instructors and people say that you can

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.320 
instructors and people say that you can
only<00:02:03.320> get<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:03.590> fast<00:02:04.040> with<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.520> because<00:02:05.090> you

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
only get so fast with this because you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.880 
only get so fast with this because you
can<00:02:05.510> only<00:02:05.570> manipulate<00:02:05.870> those<00:02:06.380> muscles<00:02:06.800> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
can only manipulate those muscles to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.270 
can only manipulate those muscles to
move<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.250> fast<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.350> that's<00:02:09.530> why<00:02:09.680> you

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
move so fast so I think that's why you

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.380 
move so fast so I think that's why you
are<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:12.350> add<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.430> wrist<00:02:13.670> cuz<00:02:14.120> you

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
are you like add in the wrist cuz you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.110 
are you like add in the wrist cuz you
know<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.570> he's<00:02:14.930> incredibly<00:02:15.830> fast<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.180> uh

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
know you he's incredibly fast and so uh

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650 
know you he's incredibly fast and so uh
um<00:02:21.610> only<00:02:22.610> gets<00:02:22.790> fast<00:02:23.030> as<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.270> can't<00:02:23.480> like

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
um only gets fast as I can't like

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
um only gets fast as I can't like
watching<00:02:24.080> your<00:02:24.410> songs<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.640> your

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
style of playing it seems very

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.330 
style of playing it seems very
comfortable<00:02:27.410> enough<00:02:27.620> I've<00:02:28.100> been<00:02:28.280> practicing
