 as it forms in the arc camilo vargas in 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.280
 the defense juan david roa meza garcía 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.080
 marino garcía and luís carlos arias in the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.969
 Midfield by Manuel Molina Julian 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.750
 Guillermo Gerardo Bedoya william zapata 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.609
 and forward jefferson leather and caicedo yes 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.669
 lady caicedo at the end the man who 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.679
 he came from national independent with neko 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.990
 peralta enríquez and murillo line of three 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.199
 back streets pérez arias and farid díaz 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.200
 Baloy as he hooked him up and Duke and 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.260
 I miss many absences in Santa Fe 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.539
 forced by a complicated injury to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.120
 professor gutierrez to put together in the game 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.370
 and to arm the holder of holy faith and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.399
 knowing that he faced national not 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.379
 andreas and that he is missing an apple but 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.780
 please and back and Carlos Valdez would be 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.629
 yulián anchico that is, it was not easy 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.160
 It was not easy and nationals also 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.170
 having a coach like me are you 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.109
 both their rival teams then they 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.250
 understood where it was look like 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.850
 sebastián but it was very important in the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 first time it came floating sometimes 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.030
 free coming obviously from behind 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.470
 this double opportunity when sebastián 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.330
 by waiting for it the stick 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.970
 he knows that they are players that I liked 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.560
 pretty and youngsters with a hierarchy 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.930
 as it entered with arsenal that is me 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 it seems of the good thing that there is and holy faith it 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.619
 they arrive above what happens with holy faith 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.570
 and good until recent has had the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.250
 problem of the aerial game and santafé good 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.560
 I do not want to judge so strong 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 santafe today for those absences of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.700
 Andreas complicated was the party besides 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.610
 I needed holy faith to recover 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.860
 trust and without knowing what it was for 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.070
 I think that today the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.920
 first of the match get this action and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.860
 the end by putting a hug to the very 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.860
 good vacuum ball and finish 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.690
 receiving well duke nothing can do 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.890
 Here I tried what I could but I know 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.530
 ball went inside 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 the truth is that holy faith let's say that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.900
 have another expulsion if the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.000
 have expulsion data that I want to hate 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.550
 expelled by party as well as 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 had expulsions for double yellow and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.480
 this and this expulsion by direct red 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.770
 I knew I had suffered expositions of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.900
 areas of towers and now of manuel molina 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.030
 no or it has not been able santa faith that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.459
 certain negatives with the eleven 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.989
 headlines but do not get hurt false look 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.550
 This move to me I really like it is 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.930
 when santa faith does not finish the play 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 they ask for a penalty that is in my opinion 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.959
 outside the area and here comes the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.910
 backlash to make balconies still 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.800
 what's missing is that probably 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.709
 it was not criminal, not what you say 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.239
 without finishing the national backlash 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.590
 of very fast national team plays you 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.750
 national short list short playing 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 long does not have any problem and very 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.010
 good definition of duke jugadorazo 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.650
 another golazo here santa faith trying to 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.250
 do what he knows best how to handle the ball 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.739
 quiet and close at this time 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.860
 And neither Andrea nor I are seeing the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.430
 party and we were already fixing the 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.219
 for it 's late 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.840
 very very ready for you prepared 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.870
 then these last minutes the same 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.180
 but they were already on the court sister and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.069
 Duke that almost already left the tri 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.019
 way and also Juan Carlos Osorio had 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.960
 prevention in that it took out the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.880
 three cautioned 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.290
 It was the changes that the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.000
 three cautioned I did not want to run the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.290
 risk of getting ten and I say one 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.450
 thing andrés and i was wilson gutiérrez 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 in me every game leaves me with ten of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.830
 true that the scolding would be immense 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.560
 because there are no clear derivatives here street 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.980
 for duke or again you really vary 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.860
 Vargas prevented an epic night for 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.390
 duke and santafe then ends 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.100
 staying with few possibilities 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.750
 although he is still alive after 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 loses that match with the athletic 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.200
 national faith santa can not condition 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.670
 in the field with the defeat in that 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 national athletic team cardinal 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.330
 prolongs its three-year streak without power 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.590
 defeat the verdolagas in the field 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.810
 the last victory of holy faith is 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.850
 records on April 4, 2010 in the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.620
 opening where the reds won between 0 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.200
 with goals from luis yanes omar pérez and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.550
 mario gonzález since then add up for 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.140
 League three draws and two defeats 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.530
 cardenas so the quadrangular 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.050
 Then all three of them played 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.910
 national parties leader by the point 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.800
 invisible ties junior chord that the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.180
 two tied in the previous match 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.340
 and they remain with the same points but 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.549
 national is first precisely for that 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.620
 Sports advantage santa fe third with 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.460
 three points itagüí 0 points on Sunday 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.410
 Santa Fe 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.410
 and then junior national
