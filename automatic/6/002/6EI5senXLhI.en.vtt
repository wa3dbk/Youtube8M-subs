00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
we're gonna actually add some of this

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.170 
we're gonna actually add some of this
around<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:14.690> edges<00:06:16.510> because<00:06:17.510> we<00:06:18.050> need<00:06:18.230> to<00:06:19.180> just

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
around the edges because we need to just

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.840 
around the edges because we need to just
because<00:06:20.419> you<00:06:20.480> don't<00:06:20.600> want<00:06:20.720> to<00:06:20.780> fall<00:06:20.900> off<00:06:21.080> I

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
because you don't want to fall off I

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.580 
because you don't want to fall off I
don't<00:06:22.850> know<00:06:22.970> do<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:23.330> yeah<00:06:23.930> is<00:06:24.200> that<00:06:24.350> it<00:06:24.440> let's

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
don't know do you yeah is that it let's

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.000 
don't know do you yeah is that it let's
just<00:06:24.710> add<00:06:24.800> just<00:06:24.830> a<00:06:25.100> little<00:06:25.370> just<00:06:25.580> one<00:06:25.820> layer<00:06:27.010> is

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
just add just a little just one layer is

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.710 
just add just a little just one layer is
all<00:06:28.250> we're<00:06:28.370> gonna<00:06:28.490> need<00:06:28.550> because<00:06:29.419> it<00:06:29.630> just

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
all we're gonna need because it just

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.659 
all we're gonna need because it just
gives<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.080> less<00:06:30.470> likelihood<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.190> falling

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
gives you the less likelihood of falling

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:32.980 
gives you the less likelihood of falling
off<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.150> it<00:06:32.330> just<00:06:32.510> kind<00:06:32.690> of<00:06:32.720> blends

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
off and it just kind of blends

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.360 
off and it just kind of blends
everything<00:06:33.410> in<00:06:33.590> with<00:06:33.890> the

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
everything in with the

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.629 
everything in with the
rest<00:06:34.550> of<00:06:34.699> the<00:06:34.940> deck<00:06:35.510> here<00:06:36.050> of<00:06:36.830> course<00:06:37.070> now<00:06:37.280> like

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
rest of the deck here of course now like

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.490 
rest of the deck here of course now like
skeletons<00:06:38.120> are<00:06:38.210> gonna<00:06:38.389> jump<00:06:38.660> over<00:06:38.960> and<00:06:39.199> kill

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
skeletons are gonna jump over and kill

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.240 
skeletons are gonna jump over and kill
you<00:06:39.740> if<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.880> get<00:06:41.030> two<00:06:41.260> at<00:06:42.260> nighttime<00:06:42.620> I<00:06:43.070> guess

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
you if you get two at nighttime I guess

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.500 
you if you get two at nighttime I guess
the<00:06:43.400> creepers<00:06:43.729> will<00:06:43.850> better<00:06:44.060> reach<00:06:44.270> you<00:06:44.419> as

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
the creepers will better reach you as

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.629 
the creepers will better reach you as
well<00:06:44.660> too<00:06:44.840> which<00:06:45.020> is<00:06:45.139> kind<00:06:45.350> of<00:06:45.380> not<00:06:45.680> good<00:06:45.889> but<00:06:46.220> I

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
well too which is kind of not good but I

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.100 
well too which is kind of not good but I
think<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.300> maybe<00:06:47.449> it'll<00:06:47.690> blow<00:06:47.810> up<00:06:47.960> from

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
think that maybe it'll blow up from

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.670 
think that maybe it'll blow up from
there<00:06:48.760> any<00:06:49.760> more<00:06:49.970> wood<00:06:50.150> no<00:06:51.050> we've<00:06:51.290> used<00:06:51.470> it<00:06:51.590> all

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
there any more wood no we've used it all

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.590 
there any more wood no we've used it all
up

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
up

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.790 
up
and<00:06:53.600> I<00:06:53.720> don't<00:06:53.840> think<00:06:53.990> that's<00:06:54.199> gonna<00:06:54.290> be<00:06:54.410> enough

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
and I don't think that's gonna be enough

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.900 
and I don't think that's gonna be enough
oh<00:06:54.830> yeah<00:06:55.220> well<00:06:55.400> it<00:06:55.639> probably<00:06:55.729> will<00:06:55.970> be<00:06:56.000> okay

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
oh yeah well it probably will be okay

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:07.779 
oh yeah well it probably will be okay
and<00:07:01.479> here<00:07:02.479> we<00:07:02.570> go<00:07:04.479> a<00:07:05.530> little<00:07:06.530> bit<00:07:06.680> more<00:07:06.789> should

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
and here we go a little bit more should

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.210 
and here we go a little bit more should
do<00:07:07.970> it

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
do it

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.110
