00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
you lower down like that it should line

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
same spot it was before now we can put

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.600 
same spot it was before now we can put
the<00:02:44.750> 5/16<00:02:45.470> screw<00:02:45.680> back<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.070> we're<00:02:46.430> going<00:02:46.519> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the 5/16 screw back in we're going to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.670 
the 5/16 screw back in we're going to
use<00:02:46.700> our<00:02:46.820> nut<00:02:47.030> driver<00:02:47.299> as<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.470> tightening

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
use our nut driver as you're tightening

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.800 
use our nut driver as you're tightening
down<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.040> 5/16<00:02:49.610> screw<00:02:49.850> it's<00:02:50.180> very<00:02:50.420> important

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
down the 5/16 screw it's very important

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.210 
down the 5/16 screw it's very important
to<00:02:50.930> make<00:02:51.080> sure<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.410> your<00:02:51.500> switch<00:02:51.739> adjustment

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
to make sure that your switch adjustment

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.690 
to make sure that your switch adjustment
is<00:02:52.280> correct

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
is correct

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.370 
is correct
otherwise<00:02:53.330> it<00:02:53.570> could<00:02:53.690> cause<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.049> fuse<00:02:54.260> to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
otherwise it could cause the fuse to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.170 
otherwise it could cause the fuse to
short<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.280> basically<00:02:55.610> want<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.970> pull

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
short out you basically want to pull

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.070 
short out you basically want to pull
down<00:02:56.299> on<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> whole<00:02:56.690> lid<00:02:56.870> switch<00:02:57.049> assembly

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
down on the whole lid switch assembly

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.050 
down on the whole lid switch assembly
until<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.130> hear<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> click<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.880> black

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
until you hear the click of the black

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.009 
until you hear the click of the black
switch<00:03:02.500> once<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.590> hear<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.769> click<00:03:04.870> then<00:03:05.870> you

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
switch once you hear that click then you

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.199 
switch once you hear that click then you
can<00:03:06.170> tighten<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.530> down<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.910> that's<00:03:07.910> where<00:03:08.120> it

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
can tighten it down and that's where it

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.220 
can tighten it down and that's where it
needs<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.480> be<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:11.480> way<00:03:11.600> once<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.080> place

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
needs to be that way once it's in place

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.789 
needs to be that way once it's in place
and<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.860> lift<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.220> lid<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:14.420> activated<00:03:15.110> to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
and you lift the lid it's activated to

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.830 
and you lift the lid it's activated to
tell<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.100> washer<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.700> lid<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:16.880> open<00:03:17.180> so

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
tell the washer that the lid is open so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.880 
tell the washer that the lid is open so
another<00:03:18.080> way<00:03:18.170> have<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.350> tighten<00:03:18.560> down<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.830> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
another way have it tighten down in a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.250 
another way have it tighten down in a
spot<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:19.549> can<00:03:19.700> reconnect<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> wires<00:03:20.360> we're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
spot we can reconnect the wires we're

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.530 
spot we can reconnect the wires we're
gonna<00:03:21.380> hook<00:03:21.830> up<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.070> double<00:03:22.310> red<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:23.420> the

goes to the fuse holder on the other

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.370 
goes to the fuse holder on the other
side<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:33.190> brown<00:03:34.190> went<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.760> fuse<00:03:34.970> holder
