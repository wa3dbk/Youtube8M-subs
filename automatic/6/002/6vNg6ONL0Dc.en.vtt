actually i'm happy to say that after a
slower<00:00:29.720> than<00:00:30.050> anticipated<00:00:30.350> start<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.220> the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
slower than anticipated start to the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.850 
slower than anticipated start to the
flight<00:00:31.550> test<00:00:31.820> program<00:00:32.470> partially<00:00:33.470> due<00:00:33.650> to<00:00:33.680> the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
flight test program partially due to the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.130 
flight test program partially due to the
the<00:00:34.310> weather<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.880> in<00:00:35.060> this<00:00:35.480> time<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.840> year<00:00:35.989> in

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the weather and in this time of year in

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.530 
the weather and in this time of year in
the<00:00:36.170> canada<00:00:36.680> is<00:00:36.830> that<00:00:37.040> very<00:00:37.220> demanding<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.420> I'm

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
the canada is that very demanding so I'm

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.990 
the canada is that very demanding so I'm
happy<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:38.930> say<00:00:39.140> now<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:39.410> we<00:00:39.860> have<00:00:40.040> F<00:00:40.460> TV<00:00:40.670> one

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
happy to say now that we have F TV one

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.400 
happy to say now that we have F TV one
and<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.540> flight<00:00:41.690> test<00:00:41.900> program<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.230> course

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and the flight test program of course

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.049 
and the flight test program of course
had<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.559> be<00:00:42.650> to<00:00:42.890> entered<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.340> program<00:00:43.520> and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
had to be to entered the program and

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.940 
had to be to entered the program and
we're<00:00:44.570> really<00:00:44.720> building<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.350> lot<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.650> traction

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
we're really building a lot of traction

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.880 
we're really building a lot of traction
so<00:00:46.340> I'm<00:00:46.460> very<00:00:46.930> excited<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.080> about<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
so I'm very excited now about the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.260 
so I'm very excited now about the
momentum<00:00:49.340> that<00:00:49.430> we're<00:00:49.610> building<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
momentum that we're building in the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.020 
momentum that we're building in the
flight<00:00:50.480> test<00:00:50.660> program<00:00:51.110> actually<00:00:52.100> ft<00:00:52.460> b1<00:00:52.820> as

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
flight test program actually ft b1 as

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.330 
flight test program actually ft b1 as
you<00:00:53.180> know<00:00:53.329> my<00:00:54.020> last<00:00:54.200> update<00:00:54.620> was<00:00:54.800> about<00:00:55.130> to

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
you know my last update was about to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.580 
you know my last update was about to
leave<00:00:55.489> for<00:00:55.670> Wichita<00:00:56.079> aircraft<00:00:57.079> arrived<00:00:57.410> in

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
leave for Wichita aircraft arrived in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.400 
leave for Wichita aircraft arrived in
Wichita<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.399> is<00:00:58.670> now<00:00:59.120> dedicated<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.960> doing<00:01:00.200> a

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
Wichita and is now dedicated to doing a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.840 
Wichita and is now dedicated to doing a
testing<00:01:01.070> there<00:01:01.280> basically<00:01:02.239> F<00:01:02.390> 2<00:01:02.540> b1<00:01:02.720> is<00:01:03.320> doing

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
testing there basically F 2 b1 is doing

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.609 
testing there basically F 2 b1 is doing
the<00:01:04.850> handling<00:01:05.300> tests<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.140> it's<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.320> quality

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
the handling tests so it's a quality

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.490 
the handling tests so it's a quality
assessment<00:01:07.270> they've<00:01:08.270> done<00:01:08.479> also<00:01:08.720> engine

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
assessment they've done also engine

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.280 
assessment they've done also engine
tests<00:01:10.220> some<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.000> those<00:01:11.149> tests<00:01:11.540> also<00:01:11.690> involves

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
tests some of those tests also involves

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.469 
tests some of those tests also involves
shutting<00:01:12.649> down<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.009> engine<00:01:13.390> doing<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
shutting down the engine doing the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.460 
shutting down the engine doing the
engine<00:01:14.840> relights

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
engine relights

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.460 
engine relights
critical<00:01:16.160> for<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> program<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.270> I'm<00:01:18.170> happy

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
critical for the program and I'm happy

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.200 
critical for the program and I'm happy
to<00:01:18.590> say<00:01:18.830> actually<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.369> those<00:01:19.759> tests<00:01:20.149> have

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
to say actually that those tests have

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.749 
to say actually that those tests have
gone<00:01:20.420> extremely<00:01:20.899> well<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:22.100> engine<00:01:22.430> relight

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
gone extremely well the engine relight

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.600 
gone extremely well the engine relight
it<00:01:23.000> went<00:01:23.289> actually<00:01:24.289> better<00:01:24.679> than<00:01:24.860> expected<00:01:25.429> as

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
it went actually better than expected as

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.880 
it went actually better than expected as
well<00:01:25.759> within<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.179> envelope<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.649> allows

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
well within the envelope and that allows

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.340 
well within the envelope and that allows
actually<00:01:28.340> further<00:01:28.610> tests<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.119> be<00:01:29.420> done<00:01:29.450> on<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
actually further tests to be done on the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.949 
actually further tests to be done on the
program<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.610> coming<00:01:32.060> soon<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:32.600> see<00:01:32.780> here

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
program and coming soon as you see here

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.010 
program and coming soon as you see here
this<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.110> ft<00:01:33.440> b3<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.940> now<00:01:35.209> handed<00:01:35.630> over<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
this is ft b3 is now handed over to the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.800 
this is ft b3 is now handed over to the
flight<00:01:36.229> test<00:01:36.440> program<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.220> actually<00:01:38.119> will<00:01:38.630> go

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
flight test program and actually will go

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.719 
flight test program and actually will go
to<00:01:38.869> flight<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.679> coming<00:01:40.069> week<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:40.520> that

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
to flight in the coming week so that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.090 
to flight in the coming week so that
will<00:01:40.850> help<00:01:40.940> us<00:01:41.119> also<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.899> building<00:01:42.500> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
will help us also in building the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.430 
will help us also in building the
momentum<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> flight<00:01:44.330> test<00:01:44.509> program<00:01:44.929> so

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
momentum on the flight test program so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.169 
momentum on the flight test program so
this<00:01:45.590> aircraft<00:01:46.009> actually<00:01:46.310> will<00:01:46.670> do<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> first

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
this aircraft actually will do the first

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.960 
this aircraft actually will do the first
way<00:01:47.450> gear<00:01:47.869> out<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.050> Mirabel<00:01:48.560> will<00:01:49.429> do<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.580> number

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
way gear out of Mirabel will do a number

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.850 
way gear out of Mirabel will do a number
of<00:01:50.119> flights<00:01:50.360> really<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.110> just<00:01:51.319> build<00:01:51.530> up<00:01:51.709> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
of flights really to just build up the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.949 
of flights really to just build up the
maturity<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.520> aircraft<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.179> then<00:01:53.810> it

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
maturity on the aircraft and then it

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.219 
maturity on the aircraft and then it
will<00:01:54.050> be<00:01:54.170> ferried<00:01:54.619> down<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.490> Wichita<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.240> do

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
will be ferried down to to Wichita to do

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.279 
will be ferried down to to Wichita to do
the<00:01:57.470> avionics<00:01:58.369> testing<00:01:59.060> why<00:01:59.840> we<00:01:59.959> doing<00:02:00.200> the
