00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.920
 in my house 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:57.060

 you understand to have a huge potential and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.660
 I have a lot to learn from you and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.660
 honestly what a barbarian 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.069
 from truth 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.660
 the things he does as I felt like what 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.849
 as the transported channel scenarios 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.830
 incredible and I love that too 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.050
 Although he was sick in fret 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.390
 like a hurricane like always grab you and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.709
 take over the stage and this song 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:41.360
 and I ask you for a single one little thing they do 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.360
 Now that little step please see 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 what 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.170
 it makes me one click 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:16.690
 I do not know if a kind of a rare species 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.060
 they are are divine daddy my god is 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.840
 impressive the power it has of 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.840
 announcement 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.710
 good night to heaven 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.710
 your daddy what's his name 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.670
 white salmon robot if I like it 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.220
 much as sung as I eat you 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.740
 you play on stage but Juan 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.130
 ramón 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.560
 Beware of marking so many things 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.389
 we are over demanding it seems to me angel 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.810
 or someone is already an innate artist 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:01.949
 let's move away from the cliché of some gestures 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.289
 that are already sometimes overdone 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.539
 because I know they are all artists in this 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.719
 family and let him go 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.449
 finding his own course because he 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:16.090
 He has enough voice and enough 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.780
 personality to say here I am and 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.330
 point so always go back to angelo and 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.400
 it is not secret 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.800
 alicia please good night 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.780
 angelo the truth that I did not know I was 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.199
 Sick to take care of children 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.669
 because there really are many diseases 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.340
 respiratory a lot of strength and safety 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.099
 on the track before the truth that you have the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.099
 pinta de david that is indisputable is 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:45.279
 they were together a lot of potential really 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.469
 antelo I congratulate you I give you a 99 angelo 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.469
 of qualification then and finally 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.580
 Álvaro Ayala has closed the round 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.240
 absolutely agree with what he said 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.500
 emily the chair chair is a singer quoted 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.620
 of right chi 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.130
 every time better you do not need anything and 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.410
 only for that detail I do not put a 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.410
