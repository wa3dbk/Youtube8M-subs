all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.680> what<00:00:01.860> I'd<00:00:01.949> like<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> bit

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right what I'd like to talk a bit

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.010 
all right what I'd like to talk a bit
about<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:05.210> subcultures<00:00:06.210> or<00:00:06.450> cost<00:00:06.720> per

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
about today is subcultures or cost per

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.180 
about today is subcultures or cost per
cm<00:00:07.680> anus<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.220> especially<00:00:08.580> Siena<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:10.070> one<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
cm anus and especially Siena and one of

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.499 
cm anus and especially Siena and one of
the<00:00:11.280> main<00:00:11.490> things<00:00:11.759> I'd<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.179> talk<00:00:12.360> about

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the main things I'd like to talk about

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.259 
the main things I'd like to talk about
is<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:13.200> much<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.530> increase<00:00:13.679> cultures<00:00:14.610> from

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
is how much you increase cultures from

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.390 
is how much you increase cultures from
the<00:00:16.049> point<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.560> having<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.570> single<00:00:18.570> point

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
the point of having a single point

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.250 
the point of having a single point
inoculation<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:21.029> having<00:00:21.330> lawns<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.840> Canadia

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
inoculation to having lawns of Canadia

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
inoculation to having lawns of Canadia
--that<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.710> used<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.250> inoculate<00:00:23.460> liquid

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
--that can be used to inoculate liquid

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140 
--that can be used to inoculate liquid
cultures<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.750> DNA<00:00:25.080> extraction<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> here's<00:00:27.029> an

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
cultures for DNA extraction so here's an

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
cultures for DNA extraction so here's an
example<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.710> culture<00:00:30.170> that<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.470> we

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
example of a culture that is we

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.650 
example of a culture that is we
inoculated<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.210> grown<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.260> probably<00:00:35.660> around

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
inoculated and grown for probably around

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.080 
inoculated and grown for probably around
two<00:00:37.020> weeks<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> case<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> can

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
two weeks in this case and as you can

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.290 
two weeks in this case and as you can
see<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.950> culture<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.070> uneven<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.790> color<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
see the culture is uneven in color and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
see the culture is uneven in color and
morphology<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.969> regions<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
morphology but there are regions that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990 
morphology but there are regions that
are<00:00:45.210> producing<00:00:45.960> Canadian<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.489> those<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
are producing Canadian and so those can

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
are producing Canadian and so those can
be<00:00:48.030> cut<00:00:48.840> using<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.440> panning<00:00:49.800> technique

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
be cut using the panning technique

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.350 
be cut using the panning technique
described<00:00:50.670> earlier<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:53.360> gradually

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
described earlier and gradually

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
described earlier and gradually
amplified<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:56.059> produce<00:00:57.140> lawns<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.590> Canadia<00:00:59.250> as

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
amplified to produce lawns of Canadia as

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
amplified to produce lawns of Canadia as
you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.000> here

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
you can see here

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.130 
you can see here
in<00:01:02.129> time<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.179> can<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.780> cut<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:06.140> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
in time that can then be cut out to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.130 
in time that can then be cut out to
produce<00:01:07.320> increasingly<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.520> uniform<00:01:09.060> loans

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.310 

until<00:01:13.140> finally<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> fairly<00:01:14.189> consistent

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
until finally a fairly consistent

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.480 
until finally a fairly consistent
uniformly<00:01:16.320> committee<00:01:16.740> ated<00:01:17.040> culture<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
uniformly committee ated culture is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.249 
uniformly committee ated culture is
obtained<00:01:18.350> these<00:01:19.350> cultures<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.369> turn<00:01:20.729> be

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
obtained these cultures can in turn be

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.520 
obtained these cultures can in turn be
scraped<00:01:22.310> with<00:01:23.420> sterile<00:01:24.420> water<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.200> hockey

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
scraped with sterile water and a hockey

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.270 
scraped with sterile water and a hockey
stick<00:01:25.920> spreader<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.180> obtain<00:01:28.130> solutions<00:01:29.130> of

stick spreader to obtain solutions of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.210 
stick spreader to obtain solutions of
Canadia<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> plated<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.439> rapidly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
Canadia which can be plated to rapidly

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.210 
Canadia which can be plated to rapidly
increase<00:01:32.570> production<00:01:33.570> committee<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> an

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
increase production committee so an

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
increase production committee so an
example<00:01:36.470> would<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> nice<00:01:39.659> uniform

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
example would be this is a nice uniform

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.330 
example would be this is a nice uniform
culture<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.759> oip<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.860> strain<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> circus

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
culture of the oip a strain of circus

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.600 
culture of the oip a strain of circus
for<00:01:44.549> siena<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.679> show<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
for siena and just to show the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.919 
for siena and just to show the
difference<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.659> suspension<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
difference this is a suspension a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.949 
difference this is a suspension a
Canadian<00:01:52.920> suspension<00:01:53.520> culture<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.840> has

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
Canadian suspension culture that has

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.340 
Canadian suspension culture that has
gone<00:01:55.110> too<00:01:55.350> long<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.429> as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.850> see

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
gone too long so as you can see

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.130 
gone too long so as you can see
certainly<00:01:58.350> there's<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.069> lot<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.539> white<00:02:00.539> areal

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
certainly there's a lot of white areal

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
certainly there's a lot of white areal
high<00:02:01.409> feed<00:02:01.679> being<00:02:01.920> formed<00:02:02.399> vegetation<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
high feed being formed vegetation and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.440 
high feed being formed vegetation and
the<00:02:03.479> culture<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.590> does<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.670> recover<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the culture which does not recover and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
the culture which does not recover and
if<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> were<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.710> scraped<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
if this were to be scraped and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.029 
if this were to be scraped and
inoculated<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> plates<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:10.500> certainly<00:02:10.859> would

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
inoculated to plates it certainly would

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.180 
inoculated to plates it certainly would
not<00:02:11.090> generate<00:02:12.090> very<00:02:12.690> many<00:02:12.870> Canadian<00:02:13.350> it's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
not generate very many Canadian it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
not generate very many Canadian it's
less<00:02:14.430> than<00:02:14.579> ideal<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.570> inoculation

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
less than ideal to use for inoculation

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.190 
less than ideal to use for inoculation
of<00:02:16.739> cultures<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.430> genomic<00:02:17.850> DNA

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.530 

so<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> process<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.160> start<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:23.000> liquid<00:02:23.330> culture

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
so the process to start a liquid culture

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.320 
so the process to start a liquid culture
is<00:02:24.160> actually<00:02:25.160> quite<00:02:25.580> straightforward<00:02:25.849> and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
is actually quite straightforward and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.070 
is actually quite straightforward and
simple<00:02:27.910> usually<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> add<00:02:29.239> about<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.510> mil<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
simple usually I add about a mil of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.339 
simple usually I add about a mil of
sterile<00:02:30.560> water<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> plate<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:35.319> with<00:02:36.319> a

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
sterile water to a plate and with a

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.160 
sterile water to a plate and with a
spreader

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.080 

gently<00:02:42.040> scrape<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:43.480> surface<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.470> plate

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
gently scrape the surface of the plate

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.580 
gently scrape the surface of the plate
the<00:02:46.090> most<00:02:46.270> important<00:02:46.660> thing<00:02:46.810> here<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.230> just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
the most important thing here is to just

as so and then with a usually I would

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.960 
as so and then with a usually I would

get a fresh sterile hockey spreader

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.400 
get a fresh sterile hockey spreader
but<00:04:25.970> then<00:04:26.120> simply<00:04:26.479> played<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.930> lot<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.290> you

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
but then simply played it a lot like you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.070 
but then simply played it a lot like you
would<00:04:27.560> bacteria<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.580> plate<00:04:29.320> uniform

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
would bacteria on the plate uniform

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
would bacteria on the plate uniform
spread<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.169> around<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.770> then<00:04:34.729> normally<00:04:35.000> what

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
spread it around and then normally what

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.240 
spread it around and then normally what
I<00:04:35.360> would<00:04:35.419> do<00:04:35.750> would<00:04:36.200> be<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.410> transfer<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
I would do would be to transfer the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.830 
I would do would be to transfer the
plate<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.760> front<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.419> laminar<00:04:38.780> flow
