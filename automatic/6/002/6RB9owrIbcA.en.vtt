00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
won't be skating around too much it runs

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.039 
won't be skating around too much it runs

on a 114 octane race fuel which actually
makes<00:01:50.319> it<00:01:50.439> burn<00:01:50.590> slower<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.520> gets<00:01:51.670> more

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
makes it burn slower so it gets more

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.819 
makes it burn slower so it gets more
power<00:01:52.090> out<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:52.479> small<00:01:53.350> wheels<00:01:53.560> usually

underneath<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.079> see<00:03:35.260> here<00:03:35.530> little

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
underneath this you can see here little

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.580 
underneath this you can see here little
wheels<00:03:36.099> here<00:03:36.430> inside<00:03:36.849> outside<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:38.290> relieve

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
wheels here inside outside to relieve

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.710 
wheels here inside outside to relieve
the<00:03:38.769> pressure<00:03:38.940> from<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> track<00:03:40.329> from<00:03:40.540> hitting

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the pressure from the track from hitting

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.659 
the pressure from the track from hitting
the<00:03:40.870> height<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.590> rail<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:41.859> aluminum<00:03:42.430> rail

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
the height the rail and aluminum rail

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.729 
the height the rail and aluminum rail
here<00:03:42.909> we<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> chain<00:03:43.840> back<00:03:44.169> here<00:03:44.470> wrapped

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
here we have a chain back here wrapped

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.009 
here we have a chain back here wrapped
in<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.340> back<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.699> the<00:03:45.760> suspension<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:46.870> can

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
in the back of the suspension so we can

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.629 
in the back of the suspension so we can
pull<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.379> back<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.799> sled<00:03:47.949> down<00:03:48.250> three

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
pull the back of the sled down three

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.490 
pull the back of the sled down three
inches<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.180> can<00:03:49.299> get<00:03:49.449> lower<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.409> ground

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
inches so we can get lower to the ground

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.080 
inches so we can get lower to the ground
so<00:03:50.859> we<00:03:50.919> can<00:03:51.040> get<00:03:51.190> more<00:03:51.729> speed<00:03:53.849> it's<00:03:54.849> got<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
so we can get more speed it's got the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.789 
so we can get more speed it's got the
Fox<00:03:55.329> shocks<00:03:55.629> on<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.260> really<00:03:56.379> easy<00:03:56.680> to

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
Fox shocks on it so it's really easy to

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.309 
Fox shocks on it so it's really easy to
do<00:03:57.040> we<00:03:57.699> only<00:03:57.849> put<00:03:58.030> like<00:03:58.180> 25<00:03:58.720> pounds<00:03:58.989> of

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
do we only put like 25 pounds of

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.619 
do we only put like 25 pounds of
pressure<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.459> eat<00:04:00.579> shocks<00:04:00.909> would<00:04:01.180> lower<00:04:01.419> the

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
pressure and eat shocks would lower the

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.229 
pressure and eat shocks would lower the
front<00:04:01.840> end<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.229> then<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.220> went<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.639> shortened

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
front end and then we went and shortened

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.599 
front end and then we went and shortened
up<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.510> strap<00:04:04.810> on<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.889> suspension<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.489> the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
up the strap on the suspension on the

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.430 
up the strap on the suspension on the
front<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:06.909> the<00:04:07.000> suspension<00:04:07.419> widget<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.169> can't

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
front of the suspension widget you can't

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.559 
front of the suspension widget you can't
see<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:08.829> they<00:04:08.919> have<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.069> strap<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.669> we<00:04:09.790> shorten

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
see but they have a strap so we shorten

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.689 
see but they have a strap so we shorten
