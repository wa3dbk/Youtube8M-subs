00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to all youtubers in this video 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.870
 we'll see how to make the samsung router 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 galaxy next then it is very simple 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.150
 just download a zip file that you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 I leave in description and once 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.859
 unloaded veil pass on the microsd of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 telephone via the cable a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 micro sd adapter once 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 you have just passed this file 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 on the micro sd not to put it in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.519
 no subfolder so put it on 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.140
 directly in the main micro sd 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.460
 without copying it to subfolders 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:44.750
 put it directly on the micro sd 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.750
 anyway turn off the phone we turn off 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 and then we have to go into recovery for 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 go the recovery we have to click the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:02.719
 home button at the same time as the button 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.719
 ignition then only more between stone 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 ok now we are in recovery this yes 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 call clockworkmod recovery that has us 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.100
 installed just me however generally the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.009
 Normal phone recovery is done 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.920
 let's say they are a little different knows less voices 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.930
 for example, however, the general principle is yes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 that you have this that you have another 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.290
 you have to go up using the arrow keys 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 volume you have to go its more than the roms sd 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.250
 card confirm us with the waves button then 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 go and look for the file the zip file of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.479
 ruth then there will be written ruth point 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 zip something like that and confirm with 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.939
 the home button and install it puts us 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 a few seconds to install it once 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.490
 that installed just that you click 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.430
 with the home sure box in stand now 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.070
 so the system restarts perfect now 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.340
 your phone and root and then 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.560
 Just turn it on 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.420
