00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.640

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:10.759

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.030
 Hey I was playing under Dom old days also there was no longer ride Dom system itself 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.440
 Ger Mari Please 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 Oh , it will be taken relay 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.030
 Well then look at the general purpose-see here in the broadcast 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 I will run away 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 Itee sp 2 are the Is it in the sand 2 without 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.490
 sp 2 house 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.010
 Let's stop and let's start with clothes first 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.480
 Hmmm I can not help it 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:45.510
 Gercah has fallen too, and can you prepare the side ? 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.510
 Smoke is also ready ok at most one 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 I aim 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 ok I get in the way, so avoid it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.210
 Affix Come on front 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:05.100
 Tsukasa Sosan, this is the Zeon, so let's attack it ok 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 Luckily the fighters are on the front and will stop 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.539
 Smoke shield 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.069
 Green tea rushes out 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.749
 Caught Uwatto 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.019
 Thrusts it not a problem that was delayed one tempo but it is 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:26.590
 Stop it-that beam hurts 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:32.090
 Recent flagship is thought to come era of what you want b Yeah, you and cut skin wax to beam 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:40.129
 You know, all the new aircraft all beam extraction this installed Jim Ca 2 or me 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:46.550
 I think that it is the direction I would like to make 5% development at the New Year event if I absolutely make it. 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.870
 Ecp 325 I wonder if hard work how much people have already been completed took 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.890
 but 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.750
 I'm tired of being honest and I'll do my best so far 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.090
 Stop now 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.310
 I left in Miri favorite in the Uwa calculation This is a retreat 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.340
 Aoi pinch sweet ow 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.480
 Even ed alone will take you along 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.920
 All around 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.920
 Why hit 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.210
 Sortie Depending again over 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:25.770
 Smoke screen mmi found that speed will be bd 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:27.530
 At the speed of my favorite Muco coming, I 'm slightly lacking in stealth effect 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.860
 If you sit 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.090
 Stenvai 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.900
 There in the fire mission completed 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:41.459
 I've made it here too, but I still don't have enough points 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.940
 Go Oh put say this gel Mari amazing Wow forcibly relay 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:49.590
 It is safe because I support it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.220
 I guess I will write a smoke screen for teaching 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.410
 &amp; Kawabe 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.410
 I wonder if it will come 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.760
 I won't come because I'm buying points 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:05.870
 Oh yes, do you go ? 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.870
 Anyway, it looks good 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:16.180
 Or 8 arrangement was aimed was generally found 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.970
 Also take ally of the other to have taken relay 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.890
 Well so network 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.310
 Wow ah ah come I took 's it what it is also disadvantageous I convex in this state 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.220
 I caught up with Tegel Mari 2 back back 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.580
 Wow your true it or go even us 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.949
 Stealth effect activated 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.190
 &amp; Jump Fighting Machine Find It All, leave it to me 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:45.509
 One who says ok dowaji swordsmanship 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.620
 The aircraft Ne slip Year from generation to generation in the wholesale Hona earth 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:53.360
 And Gerukya's is targeted while toying dangerous 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:00.750
 If it is a nice counter, I will chase it 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:06.120
 In addition, I will do my best to keep up with the pursuit 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.940
 I'm sorry for the counter bronze statue to go down the fighting machine like this 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.200
 As expected 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.900
 Gerka can survive with this 8 groups hp or 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.550
 It's a critical moment, let's just do it 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.560
 Toma Smoke Shield 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:28.180
 It 's okay to go down one after another 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:33.330
 I'm also defeated , but fp 2 behind is a bother 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:37.330
 It last romp good at this if not come down Well 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:41.480
 Point difference is to withdrawal after you are using 500 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.750
 Finally let me go down- I'm also chasing 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.840
 Dissolution I will go to the left if Miggie District 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:56.090
 It will move on to the radar because pinch is triggered Oh this Futaba has suffered it joined later 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:01.310
 Now I'm out of the radar to bear either way 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.570
 It is late and the opponent's advance is delayed by the absence effect. 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:12.280
 Goon I already had a bit, but did I get in the sp 2 lane? 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:13.710
 Rely not in and yo me bd's ask is stop here 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.280
 The 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:22.720
 The remaining 48 seconds I can not fall 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.550
 Like ally Naa I want to return to base awaits here 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.440
 What should I do 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.310
 It's safe if you go down like this, but I 'll try to send you a message 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.710
 Do not lower the front line 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.700
 Yaoi line gel is out too much in front 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:41.300
 Wow I was tackled-I have to do it 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.810
 It's Oh I think it was unreasonable off 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.889
 You can not lose unless you drop one tree 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:52.770
 I survived somehow but this is a bad thing 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:55.210
 I want to do this Pajimu Geruka's unsatisfied pursuit request I will run away 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.009
 The old woman who avoids 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.330
 It was dangerous 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:04.470
 Oh, Mr. Engel 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:09.680
 In time for the sound's Ae' Well over the last minute 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.680
 There is for the time being tired like N 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:20.509
 This was the last moment I won 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:23.750
 The last head-to-head but I just I had fled the scene is the best regards because it reflected on my screen 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:29.790
 Well it was a terrible movement of the game even if it 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:33.710
 I can't help it but this time it will be up to here 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.710
 I said Thank You
