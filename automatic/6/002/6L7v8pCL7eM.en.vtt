00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
car from creo parametric and bring into

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.209 
car from creo parametric and bring into
a<00:00:10.290> game<00:00:10.590> called<00:00:10.920> GTA<00:00:11.309> 4<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.650> basically<00:00:13.980> if

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
a game called GTA 4 so so basically if

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
you have a camera you can even pull into

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.480 
you have a camera you can even pull into
a<00:00:17.940> game<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.810> there's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.500> number<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> steps<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
a game and there's a number of steps you

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.599 
a game and there's a number of steps you
need<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.650> bring<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> game<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.519> have

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
need to do to bring into a game and have

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.890 
need to do to bring into a game and have
some<00:00:23.850> fun<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.480> here's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.070> model<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.699> car

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
some fun so here's a model of a car

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
some fun so here's a model of a car
parametric<00:00:28.910> I've<00:00:29.910> done<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> number<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:31.140> throws

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
parametric I've done a number two throws

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.010 
parametric I've done a number two throws
on<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> model<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> car<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.059> I'll<00:00:33.450> create<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
on how to model a car and I'll create a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.119 
on how to model a car and I'll create a
car<00:00:34.399> which<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.969> Lamborghini<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.440> after<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
car which is a Lamborghini so after you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
car which is a Lamborghini so after you
have<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.309> model<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.730> bring<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.469> free<00:00:40.469> max

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
have your model we bring into free max

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420 
have your model we bring into free max
here's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> feeling<00:00:41.820> max<00:00:42.000> model<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
here's a feeling max model you need to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.389 
here's a feeling max model you need to
break<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:45.239> surfaces<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.399> individual

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
break up two surfaces in individual

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.080 
break up two surfaces in individual
parts<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:49.520> they're<00:00:50.520> separate<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.570> can

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
parts so they're separate and they can

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
parts so they're separate and they can
they<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.710> interact<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.980> four<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> came

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
they can be interact with four I came

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.990 
they can be interact with four I came
like<00:00:57.300> GTA<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.920> after<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.460> parts

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
like GTA so after you have your parts

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
like GTA so after you have your parts
you<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.420> export<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.590> program

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you would export that into a program

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
you would export that into a program
called<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.379> mall<00:01:04.379> version<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.810> can

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
called the mall version two and you can

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
called the mall version two and you can
use<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> format<00:01:07.830> called<00:01:09.530> free<00:01:10.530> deists<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
use a format called free deists so you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.570 
use a format called free deists so you
you<00:01:12.360> sell<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.900> patterns<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.770> arrest<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you sell your patterns of arrest and you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.960 
you sell your patterns of arrest and you
bring<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.600> molar<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.070> program<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
bring to the molar and this program that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.630 
bring to the molar and this program that
you<00:01:18.390> configured<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.409> car<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.250> works<00:01:20.490> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you configured the car so it works in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.080 
you configured the car so it works in
jail

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
jail

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.770 
jail
gtfo<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:23.100> exports<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> car<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:26.450> WFT<00:01:27.450> file

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
gtfo it exports the car as a WFT file

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
gtfo it exports the car as a WFT file
and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.740> let<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:30.530> import<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> game

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and that will let you import to the game

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.679 
and that will let you import to the game
and<00:01:32.790> work<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> game<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.270> K<00:01:36.540> I'll

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and work in the game so so that's K I'll

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
and work in the game so so that's K I'll
show<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.320> game<00:01:37.590> foolish<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.640> see

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
