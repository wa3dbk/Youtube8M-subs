00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.100
 comments in Spanish of sixto quiroga 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 Moment moment is going to start the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.320
 party and I from the bench we are going to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 is what you see look at how the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.479
 coach enrique rarest moves 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 let's go back there because my debut in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.310
 brief and we're going to hear about the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.070
 narration of the announcers comes in and it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 fulfills the dream of all his life good his 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 first match of the nba 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.900
 this player woke up a lot 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.940
 spectacular of that night of the draft 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.590
 He was one of the first elected 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:34.110
 that his team is very happy with him 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.920
 Let there be when it arrives in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.180
 first that is a triple one pass no 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.649
 come let's give a pass because what of the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.820
 triple seems to me excessive go landry 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.460
 get it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.010
 doing very well you are doing very 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.479
 well there are many people we are debuting 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.690
 in phoenix where it is very hot or the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.510
 black see how you are we go there happens 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 block attention that the mind does not the 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.440
 bounce bounce bounce bounce we will 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.940
 counterattack let's go let's use loyal and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.979
 no no no no no terror controls us 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.590
 control, control, control 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.970
 good pass give me back the landry that the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.350
 it pulled negative from the Latin earth less 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.030
 another triple 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.250
 so he achieves his first basket in the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.490
 Exactly you have heard how canijo says 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.440
 he achieves his first canijo basket achieves his 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.440
 first basket to see what telling me 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.950
 exact work ethic 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.349
 exact exact work ethic is what 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.270
 It distinguishes me less when at night 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.040
 so I do not do anything but ethics of 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.050
 clear work that yes I already changed what you have 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.330
 well done good return soon 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.500
 coach voucher is worth but it has not 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 given time to nothing like that is that what was done 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.410
 all good to see when it's two or 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.810
 three minutes 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.120

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.500
 sheet metal they give me a lot for good defense 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.000
 clear shot itself goes out there 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 triple attention on your face 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.370

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.940
 two triples in a match I'm going overcoming 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.100
 challenges and challenges six points a 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.580

 get to rest follow rock consumer 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.730
 good pass you have to say that in this 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.440
 game has greatly improved the passes before 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.210
 a pass that seemed obvious and what 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.980
 you could do with any player and 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.900
 I also had a lot to pass always 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.430
 I chose the worst option and I always 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 they stole and here are the things that have 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.940
 improved and that benefits me 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.250
 terribly if he pulls yours and 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.810
 calm do not worry so I'm 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.630
 very happy because the passes are already with 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.880
 a little bit of meaning example there I'm going to 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.650
 give assists and put it in but not good 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.150
 they are going to give you something in order that I am very 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.430
 happy with that I'm doing a 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.540
 I have not done anything wrong yet 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.420
 that we are about to finish the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.700
 rest and everything is fine to see what I 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.440
 he says I really like what you are what 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.390
 I'm seeing it go on like that, thanks Marc 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.290
 you are marc was a base base of the 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.380
 new york knicks of the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.040
 Marc Jackson many teams a veteran 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.080
 an illustrious of the world of the basket but 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.400
 I want to do another look now I get the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.290
 played a lot of people ask me how 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.700
 you make for the moves to come out 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.110
 idea because they do not always come out 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.980
 they started sometimes yes sometimes not the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.070
 attention another triple 3 of 3 yes 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.770
 three of three canijo do not walk short of 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.330
 talent said she is not short talent 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.850
 Of course, yes, daimiel, I repeated all 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.230
 with me I want to go in your house canijo 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.510
 does not go short of talent good to see 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.310
 let's go you've done it very well 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.410
 you will come back very well very soon 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.009
 the last quarter to see how I come back in 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.710
 I know that 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.869
 that took a match will be your son of your 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.529
 mother, what have you read? 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:13.969
 you will come back immediately and immediately and 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.249
 I was ten minutes on the bench but 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.259
 you are good in order three of three in 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.539
 triple shots two assists 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.119
 excellent my debut at the nba and you have already 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.309
 heard from daimiel it seems to me that the canijo 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.699
 walks short of talent look look 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.699
 as it says 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.550
 192 little coins, I hope I have 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.289
 liked the game we are going to see a 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.999
 musical composition with my best 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.949
 moments look what triplazo with the uncle in 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.990
 the good face this looks very good I think 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.389
 that will go much better than in the 2k 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.009
 12 and who knows how far I'm going to get 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.419
 Well, I'm going to make a video 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.550
 little analyzing the good and the bad of 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.889
 I play for you to make one for you 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.860
 make an idea remember each day until 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.749
 next Friday a video of nba 2k 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.129
 13 those who do not like it so they go 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.419
 directly to the weekend and it 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.860
 jump all these vouchers to see what I 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.839
 questions are made of slut the nba 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.729
 we wait for more minutes or consider that 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.039
 are successful debut let's say that has 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.270
 been a good start I would like to say 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.039
 I'm disappointed but let's say 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.000
 we are very beginning we liked 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.020
 I hope 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.020
 as always 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.390
 it seems that canijo does not walk short of 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.390
 talent 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.370
 for the same
