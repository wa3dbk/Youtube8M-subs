00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
as a first layer 2 over I looked at

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
as a first layer 2 over I looked at
layer<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.010> please<00:00:47.340> make<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.969> full<00:00:48.360> size<00:00:48.600> but

position it just above the middle so it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290 
position it just above the middle so it
should<00:00:52.469> look<00:00:52.559> something<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.300> now

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
layer 3 you want to buy a Venn which is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080 
layer 3 you want to buy a Venn which is
on<00:00:59.699> page<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.550> make<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> first

layer and the venue want to color the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.590 
layer and the venue want to color the
same<00:01:06.150> yellow<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> background<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:08.600> position

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
same yellow as a background and position

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100 
same yellow as a background and position
that<00:01:10.700> rotator<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.000> angle<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.659> should

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that rotator on an angle so you should

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.280 
that rotator on an angle so you should
get<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.000> start<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> left<00:01:15.840> side<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
get the start off the left side of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.280 
get the start off the left side of the
batwing<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:17.540> don't<00:01:18.540> worry<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.110> about

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
batwing now don't worry too much about

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
batwing now don't worry too much about
positioning<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.090> size<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> now

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
positioning and the size of it for now

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.660 
positioning and the size of it for now
because<00:01:22.350> we'll<00:01:22.590> fix<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.070> later<00:01:23.369> but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because we'll fix it all up later but

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.050 
because we'll fix it all up later but
just<00:01:24.390> roughly<00:01:25.110> position<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
just roughly position it how you you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.410 
just roughly position it how you you
think<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
think they are it would look so that's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899 
think they are it would look so that's
too<00:01:31.229> big<00:01:31.439> now<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> smaller

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
too big now so I want to make it smaller

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.140 
too big now so I want to make it smaller
and<00:01:33.770> position<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.520> more<00:01:35.820> towards

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and position a little bit more towards

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200 
and position a little bit more towards
the<00:01:36.360> left's<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:38.159> play<00:01:38.759> around<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the left's and just play around with it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
the left's and just play around with it
you<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.720> takes<00:01:40.079> some<00:01:40.320> fidgeting<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you know it takes some fidgeting but you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
you know it takes some fidgeting but you
get<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.450> happy<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.170> now

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
get there so I'm happy with that for now

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
get there so I'm happy with that for now
and<00:01:43.560> we'll<00:01:43.950> buy<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.520> another<00:01:45.210> pen<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.399> do<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and we'll buy a another pen and do the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
and we'll buy a another pen and do the
same<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.570> rotate<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.110> opposite<00:01:49.500> way

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
same but just rotate at the opposite way

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.410 
same but just rotate at the opposite way
so<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.610> other<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so you can get the other side of the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
so you can get the other side of the
wing<00:01:51.540> happening<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:54.259> let's<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.439> roughly

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
wing happening and let's just roughly

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
wing happening and let's just roughly
see<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> looks<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.509> now<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.020> we'll

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
see what it looks like for now but we'll

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
see what it looks like for now but we'll
fix<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.130> properly<00:01:59.369> later<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.380> for

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
fix it up properly later on so just for

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
fix it up properly later on so just for
now<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.189> show<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.210> idea<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now I want to get show you the idea of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859 
now I want to get show you the idea of
how<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.469> wings<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> just

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
how the that wings would look so just

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
how the that wings would look so just
play<00:02:07.049> around<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> till<00:02:07.920> you're<00:02:08.099> happy

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
play around with that till you're happy

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.770 
play around with that till you're happy
with<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.539> should<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:10.619> looking<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.629> to<00:02:12.629> get

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
with it you should be looking for to get

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
with it you should be looking for to get
it<00:02:12.959> properly

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it properly

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
it properly
the<00:02:13.920> opposite<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.549> other<00:02:14.670> side<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.239> you

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the opposite of the other side so you

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.479 
the opposite of the other side so you
want<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.569> get<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:15.900> even<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:17.190> if<00:02:17.340> it's

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
want to get it all even because if it's

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.710 
want to get it all even because if it's
not<00:02:17.549> even<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.060> he'll<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.239> look<00:02:18.390> pretty

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
not even then he'll just look pretty

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.710 
not even then he'll just look pretty
stupid<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:20.030> play<00:02:21.030> around<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.569> little

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
idea so just gonna keep positioning a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.670 
idea so just gonna keep positioning a
little<00:02:44.010> bit<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.989> I'm<00:02:45.989> happy<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.470> for

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.949 
little bit and I'm happy with that for
now<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.700> next<00:02:47.879> thing<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.180> want<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.359> buy<00:02:48.569> is

now so the next thing you want to buy is

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.009 
now so the next thing you want to buy is
a<00:02:49.910> circle<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.989> on<00:02:52.200> page<00:02:53.989> three<00:02:54.989> I

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
a circle and that is on page three I

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.680 
a circle and that is on page three I
think<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:56.819> want<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> make<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.569> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
think and you want to make that the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.940 
think and you want to make that the
first<00:02:57.900> layer<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.530> color<00:02:59.220> yellow<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
first layer and color yellow and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.349 
first layer and color yellow and
position<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.069> fairly<00:03:02.370> small<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.209> that's

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
position it fairly small and that's

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.080 
position it fairly small and that's
gonna<00:03:03.569> act<00:03:04.319> as<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> separation<00:03:05.700> between<00:03:05.879> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
gonna act as the separation between the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.130 
gonna act as the separation between the
top<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.810> wing<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.489> bat<00:03:08.489> head<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.140> you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
top of the wing and the bat head so you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.020 
top of the wing and the bat head so you
want<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> position<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.400> little<00:03:11.790> bit<00:03:11.879> to

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
want to position that a little bit to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.330 
want to position that a little bit to
the<00:03:12.120> left<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.599> middle<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.129> don't<00:03:14.129> have

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
the left of the middle and don't have

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.089 
the left of the middle and don't have
the<00:03:14.489> whole<00:03:14.730> circle<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.720> probably<00:03:16.260> cut

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
the whole circle in just probably cut

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.659 
the whole circle in just probably cut
the<00:03:17.220> top<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.849> yeah<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.169> it<00:03:19.709> looks<00:03:20.400> quite

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
the top off it yeah so it looks quite

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.839 
the top off it yeah so it looks quite
like<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> bat<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.930> makes<00:03:22.709> sense<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.609> Batman

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
like a bat that makes sense the Batman

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.960 
like a bat that makes sense the Batman
so<00:03:24.389> I'm<00:03:25.579> now<00:03:26.579> by<00:03:27.510> another<00:03:28.019> circle<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
so I'm now by another circle and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.550 
so I'm now by another circle and
position<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.959> opposite<00:03:31.319> side<00:03:33.560> there

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
position that on the opposite side there

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.879 
position that on the opposite side there
should<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.919> okay<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.810> layer<00:03:36.810> 74<00:03:37.530> last<00:03:37.680> layer

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
should be okay and layer 74 last layer

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.470 
should be okay and layer 74 last layer
you<00:03:38.099> want<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> buy<00:03:38.459> batteries<00:03:38.819> which<00:03:39.209> are<00:03:39.329> on

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
you want to buy batteries which are on

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.400 
you want to buy batteries which are on
page<00:03:39.780> three<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.540> make<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> first<00:03:43.139> layer

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
page three and make that the first layer

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.559 
page three and make that the first layer
and<00:03:43.970> color<00:03:44.970> them<00:03:45.060> black<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:47.030> make<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> smaller

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
and you want to position the middle of

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.990 
and you want to position the middle of
the<00:03:52.199> head<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.650> batteries<00:03:53.099> on<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.519> top<00:03:53.790> of

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
the head of the batteries on the top of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.990 
the head of the batteries on the top of
the<00:03:54.569> cut<00:03:54.780> off<00:03:55.129> so<00:03:56.129> right<00:03:56.400> about<00:03:56.549> there<00:03:56.879> you

the cut off so right about there you
don't<00:03:57.180> want<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.389> have<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.660> whole<00:03:58.290> head

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
don't want to have the whole head

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.089 
don't want to have the whole head
showing<00:03:59.129> just<00:03:59.790> about<00:03:59.970> half<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.099> now

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
showing just about half of it and now

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.349 
showing just about half of it and now
i'm<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.430> play<00:04:02.579> around<00:04:02.699> a<00:04:02.910> bit<00:04:02.940> with<00:04:03.150> the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
i'm going to play around a bit with the

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.580 
i'm going to play around a bit with the
circle<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.199> looks<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.500> bit<00:04:04.590> more<00:04:04.739> better<00:04:04.919> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
circle so it looks a bit more better and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.729 
circle so it looks a bit more better and
that<00:04:07.590> should<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.889> all<00:04:07.919> right<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.870> now<00:04:09.870> i'm

going to play around with the venza bit

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.150 
going to play around with the venza bit
to<00:04:12.540> make<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.690> look<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.989> little<00:04:13.109> bit<00:04:13.260> better<00:04:13.379> so

so<00:04:27.160> it's<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> bit<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.790> resizing<00:04:28.180> here<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.690> there

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.320 

and<00:04:31.960> once<00:04:32.380> I'm<00:04:32.530> done<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.889> should<00:04:32.919> see<00:04:33.330> roughly

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
and once I'm done you should see roughly

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.900 
and once I'm done you should see roughly
what<00:04:34.509> it<00:04:34.600> would<00:04:34.690> look<00:04:34.810> like<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.789> mean<00:04:36.789> you'd

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
what it would look like I mean you'd

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.490 
what it would look like I mean you'd
obviously<00:04:37.120> spend<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.750> little<00:04:37.900> bit<00:04:38.020> more<00:04:38.199> time

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
obviously spend a little bit more time

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.300 
obviously spend a little bit more time
with<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:38.800> than<00:04:39.009> I<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.340> because<00:04:40.590> I've<00:04:41.590> live

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
with this than I have because I've live

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.740 
with this than I have because I've live
at<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.460> time<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.820> I<00:04:42.880> can<00:04:43.030> only<00:04:43.150> record<00:04:43.479> with

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
at a time that I can only record with

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.070 
at a time that I can only record with
but<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:45.220> just<00:04:45.250> keep<00:04:45.880> resizing<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.600> now<00:04:46.900> you're

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
but so just keep resizing it now you're

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.409 
but so just keep resizing it now you're
going<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.259> get<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:47.530> little<00:04:47.940> black<00:04:48.940> triangle

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
going to get this little black triangle

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.840 
going to get this little black triangle
towards<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.780> bottom<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.639> that's<00:04:51.639> that's

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
towards the bottom and that's that's

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.400 
towards the bottom and that's that's
really<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:52.960> it's<00:04:53.169> going<00:04:53.350> to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
really going to it's like it's going to

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.100 
really going to it's like it's going to
show<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:54.330> background<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.479> want<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.810> cover

that up I mean you can buy an extra
layer<00:04:58.509> but<00:04:58.930> it's<00:04:59.530> not<00:04:59.770> worth<00:04:59.979> an<00:05:00.370> extra<00:05:00.520> five

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880
