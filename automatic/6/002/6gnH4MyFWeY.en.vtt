00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.850 

okay<00:00:00.599> so<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.810> thought<00:00:01.110> it<00:00:01.230> might<00:00:01.350> be<00:00:01.500> easier<00:00:01.800> if

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
okay so I thought it might be easier if

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.919 
okay so I thought it might be easier if
I<00:00:02.040> made<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:03.179> instead<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.629> trying

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
I made a video of this instead of trying

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.120 
I made a video of this instead of trying
to<00:00:03.959> explain<00:00:04.319> it<00:00:04.470> through<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.710> thousand

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
to explain it through a thousand

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.259 
to explain it through a thousand
pictures<00:00:05.279> so<00:00:06.270> what<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.550> usually<00:00:08.730> start

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
pictures so what I do is I usually start

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.220 
pictures so what I do is I usually start
by<00:00:09.360> cutting<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.320> top<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> bottom<00:00:12.230> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
by cutting the top and the bottom this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.269 
by cutting the top and the bottom this
is<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.679> weird<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.800> sides<00:00:20.039> like

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is going to be weird of the sides like

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.810 
is going to be weird of the sides like
this<00:00:20.550> I'll<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.300> both<00:00:21.480> sides<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.310> then<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.670> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
this I'll do both sides and then so that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
this I'll do both sides and then so that
it's<00:00:24.000> free<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.019> cut<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it's free then I'm going to cut all the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.089 
it's free then I'm going to cut all the
way<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.849> same<00:00:27.119> way<00:00:27.619> when<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
way up the same way when I get to this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.820 
way up the same way when I get to this
part<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.670> usually<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.199> layers<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
part I usually take it in two layers and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
part I usually take it in two layers and
I'll<00:00:32.009> cut<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.880> same<00:00:33.149> way<00:00:33.230> just<00:00:34.230> using<00:00:34.590> my

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
I'll cut the same way just using my

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
I'll cut the same way just using my
scissors<00:00:34.980> towards<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> seam<00:00:36.059> sorry<00:00:36.660> my

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
scissors towards the seam sorry my

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.580 
scissors towards the seam sorry my
camera<00:00:37.079> strap<00:00:37.850> towards<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> seam<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
camera strap towards the seam and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.360 
camera strap towards the seam and
sometimes<00:00:40.590> I'll<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.160> layers

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
sometimes I'll do that in two layers

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.500 
sometimes I'll do that in two layers
like<00:00:41.520> I'll<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.180> white<00:00:42.329> part

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
like I'll do this little white part

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000 
like I'll do this little white part
first<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.230> under<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> finish<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
first and then go under and finish the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
first and then go under and finish the
blue<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> cuts<00:00:45.899> clean<00:00:46.170> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
blue just so that it cuts clean just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.930 
blue just so that it cuts clean just
what<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.820> you're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
what you want to make sure when you're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
what you want to make sure when you're
cutting<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:48.570> sure<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:48.989> cut<00:00:49.260> past

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
cutting is make sure you don't cut past

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.010 
cutting is make sure you don't cut past
the<00:00:49.829> scene<00:00:50.360> because<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.510> they'll<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.780> holes

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the scene because then they'll be holes

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.619 
the scene because then they'll be holes
in<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.350> blanket<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.239> same<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:54.270> with

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
in your blanket and same thing with

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
in your blanket and same thing with
right<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.649> flaps<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.489> make<00:00:56.610> sure

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
right here on the flaps just make sure

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
right here on the flaps just make sure
you<00:00:56.850> don't<00:00:57.059> cut<00:00:57.210> past<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> seams<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.739> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
you don't cut past the seams when you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.380 
you don't cut past the seams when you
get<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> middle<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.460> same<00:01:02.640> thing<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
get to the middle I do the same thing so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.990 
get to the middle I do the same thing so
I<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.660> cut<00:01:03.870> either<00:01:04.379> side<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
I would cut either side right here and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
I would cut either side right here and
right<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.229> flap

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right here so that I have just a flap

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
right here so that I have just a flap
that's<00:01:07.740> free<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> cut<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> way

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that's free then I cut all the way

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's free then I cut all the way
across<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> same

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
across and when I get here I do the same

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
across and when I get here I do the same
thing<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> come<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.659> cut<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:12.840> here

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thing I just come up and cut right here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
thing I just come up and cut right here
come<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.070> cut<00:01:14.220> right<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:14.850> go

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
come up and cut right here and then go

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
come up and cut right here and then go
under<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> cut<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> rest<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.100> sure

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
under and cut the rest just make sure

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390 
under and cut the rest just make sure
that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that you and then this is what it's like

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
that you and then this is what it's like
when<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.850> done<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.710> cut<00:01:23.100> them

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when it's done so just I just cut them

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.539 
when it's done so just I just cut them
all<00:01:23.369> parallel<00:01:24.170> I've<00:01:25.170> cut<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.310> way

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
all parallel I've cut them this way

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.130 
all parallel I've cut them this way
before<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.360> where<00:01:27.509> I've<00:01:27.600> gone<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
before you know where I've gone in and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.350 
before you know where I've gone in and
and<00:01:28.350> I'll<00:01:29.009> cut<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.400> row<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> then

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and I'll cut this row this way and then

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.109 
and I'll cut this row this way and then
cut<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.070> way<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.610> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
cut these this this this way but it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.359 
cut these this this this way but it's
just<00:01:33.240> easier<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.200> remember<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
just easier for me to remember to and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
just easier for me to remember to and
and<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.869> some<00:01:37.140> falls<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and if you if some falls off it's not a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
and if you if some falls off it's not a
big<00:01:38.729> deal<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> frays<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.320> its

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
big deal because when it frays up its

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
big deal because when it frays up its
going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> enough

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
going to it's going to have enough

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
going to it's going to have enough
fabric<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:43.020> anyway<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.070> too

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
fabric there anyway so don't be too

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
fabric there anyway so don't be too
concerned<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.820> cut<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> piece<00:01:45.570> off<00:01:45.960> what

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
concerned if you cut a piece off what

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
concerned if you cut a piece off what
I'd<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.890> concerned<00:01:47.220> about<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.149> cut

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I'd be concerned about is if you cut

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.760 
I'd be concerned about is if you cut
past<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> seam<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.530> they'll<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
past the seam because then they'll be a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.730 
past the seam because then they'll be a
hole<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.220> blanket<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:52.530> really

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
hole in your blanket so it really

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.230 
hole in your blanket so it really
doesn't<00:01:52.920> matter<00:01:53.130> which<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> cut<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.939> but

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
doesn't matter which way you cut it but

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
doesn't matter which way you cut it but
I<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.979> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I just like to do it that way so if you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.730 
I just like to do it that way so if you
see<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.430> what<00:01:57.240> I've<00:01:57.360> done<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
see up here what I've done on you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.899 
see up here what I've done on you
probably<00:01:58.979> can't<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.280> tell<00:01:59.520> cuz<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.820> all

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
probably can't really tell cuz it's all

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.069 
probably can't really tell cuz it's all
cut<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:03.210> cut<00:02:03.450> straight<00:02:03.750> across<00:02:03.810> here

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
cut but I just cut straight across here

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.069 
cut but I just cut straight across here
and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:05.000> soon<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.329> ones<00:02:06.509> are<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.780> cut

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and then soon so these ones are all cut

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.940 
and then soon so these ones are all cut
if<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.560> look<00:02:07.740> at<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.069> they're<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.119> cut<00:02:09.450> down

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
if you look at it they're all cut down

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.940 
if you look at it they're all cut down
and<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.000> they're<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.110> cut<00:02:13.349> down<00:02:13.380> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and right here they're all cut down and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890 
and right here they're all cut down and
then<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.490> finished<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.270> did<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> little

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
then I just finished and did this little

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
then I just finished and did this little
section<00:02:16.349> right<00:02:16.380> here<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.459> little

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
section right here in this little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300 
section right here in this little
section<00:02:17.940> right<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.980> doesn't<00:02:20.040> really

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
section right here so it doesn't really

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
section right here so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:20.550> which<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> cut<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.110> be

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
matter which way you cut it but just be

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.490 
matter which way you cut it but just be
careful<00:02:22.470> not<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> cut<00:02:22.830> through<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> seam<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
careful not to cut through the seam and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.990 
careful not to cut through the seam and
and<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.190> you're<00:02:26.310> done<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.760> cut

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and then when you're done you can cut

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
and then when you're done you can cut
see<00:02:27.750> over<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.230> cut<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> perimeter<00:02:28.980> of
