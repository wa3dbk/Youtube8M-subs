that it already started to peel a couple

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.340 
that it already started to peel a couple
of<00:00:14.940> days<00:00:15.030> ago<00:00:16.640> last<00:00:17.640> night<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.180> broke<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
of days ago last night I broke out and a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
of days ago last night I broke out and a
bunch<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.949> bumps<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.609> don't<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> don't

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
bunch of bumps I don't know I don't

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.070 
bunch of bumps I don't know I don't
think<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.810> TCA<00:00:22.199> related<00:00:23.029> they<00:00:24.029> might<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
think it was TCA related they might be a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
think it was TCA related they might be a
combination<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:26.689> weather<00:00:28.400> change<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.670> weather

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
combination of weather change of weather

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.770 
combination of weather change of weather
conditions<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.080> well<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:32.059> didn't<00:00:33.059> wash<00:00:33.300> my

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

conditions as well as I didn't wash my
face<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.829> um<00:00:36.050> same<00:00:37.050> face<00:00:37.350> wash<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.950> left

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
face with my um same face wash I left

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.560 
face with my um same face wash I left
that<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.520> home<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> used<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> seize<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that at home so I used to seize the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.139 
that at home so I used to seize the
water<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.680> toner<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> used

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.310 

mouthwash<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:45.450> probably<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> bad<00:00:46.289> idea

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
mouthwash which probably was a bad idea

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.779 
mouthwash which probably was a bad idea
I<00:00:46.590> probably<00:00:46.800> could<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.070> deceased<00:00:47.430> rubbing

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I probably could have deceased rubbing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
I probably could have deceased rubbing
alcohol<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.300> something<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.079> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
alcohol or something probably would have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
alcohol or something probably would have
been<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.410> better<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.890> witch<00:00:50.160> hazel<00:00:50.610> what

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
been way better or witch hazel what

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
been way better or witch hazel what
