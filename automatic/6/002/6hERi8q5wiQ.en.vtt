into the left the final level the game

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.810 
into the left the final level the game
is<00:01:27.350> actually<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.979> easier<00:01:28.340> ones<00:01:28.429> in

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
is actually one of the easier ones in

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.290 
is actually one of the easier ones in
terms<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.119> finding<00:01:29.360> all<00:01:29.630> 12<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.080> people<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.610> at

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
terms of finding all 12 the people so at

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.520 
terms of finding all 12 the people so at
least<00:01:32.450> that's<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.780> it's<00:01:33.080> not<00:01:33.200> too<00:01:33.410> difficult

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
least that's not it's not too difficult

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.870 
least that's not it's not too difficult
but<00:01:34.039> it<00:01:34.130> also<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.399> kind<00:01:34.700> of<00:01:34.759> disappointing

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
but it also is kind of disappointing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.060 
but it also is kind of disappointing
that<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.450> final<00:01:35.840> level<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.380> easiest<00:01:36.740> one

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
that the final level is the easiest one

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.169 
that the final level is the easiest one
to<00:01:37.100> find<00:01:37.460> all<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.670> people<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:40.190> anyway<00:01:40.789> head

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
to find all the people but anyway head

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.270 
to find all the people but anyway head
up<00:01:41.360> here<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:42.289> going<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.740> right<00:01:42.890> here<00:01:43.159> and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
face or that red pulsating thing I think

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.120 
face or that red pulsating thing I think
it's<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> red<00:02:03.540> pulsating<00:02:04.080> thing<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.979> since

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
it's the red pulsating thing but since

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's the red pulsating thing but since
when<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> usually<00:02:05.700> shoot<00:02:06.030> him<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.420> end<00:02:06.600> up

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
when I usually shoot him I end up

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.229 
when I usually shoot him I end up
hitting<00:02:06.869> him<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.619> through<00:02:07.710> his<00:02:08.100> face<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
hitting him going through his face you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.240 
hitting him going through his face you
just<00:02:09.450> saw<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.890> red

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
just saw there so I think it's that red

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.340 
just saw there so I think it's that red
that<00:02:11.670> red<00:02:11.910> thing<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.480> could<00:02:12.690> hit<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> go

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that red thing that I could hit but I go

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.199 
that red thing that I could hit but I go
through<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.709> whole<00:02:13.950> part<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.459> his<00:02:14.580> body<00:02:14.730> so

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
through that whole part of his body so

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.360 
through that whole part of his body so
her<00:02:15.959> than<00:02:16.140> either<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.830> since<00:02:17.250> that's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
her than either one but since that's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
her than either one but since that's
like<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.850> glowing<00:02:18.150> red<00:02:18.569> target<00:02:19.110> i'm<00:02:19.530> ninety
