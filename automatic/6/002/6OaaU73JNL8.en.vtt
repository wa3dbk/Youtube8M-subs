 kosovo this segment growing in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 the market and about five cars 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.410

 vision of renault to save 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.620
 highly coveted segment c segment kutcher 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.809
 is developed on a platform 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.730
 common alliance and for us it's 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.370
 a real opportunity because at 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.559
 benefit from all the experience of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.190
 the alliance one with the superb proportions 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.519
 and it was to us added our dna on 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.559
 these proportions there catllar settles 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.260
 in the design strategy recover 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.720
 not explore that feat this time ago 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.019
 still a little talent of the ofs 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.019
 in 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.909
 lincou their launch these red but 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.850
 red flame so that's so really 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.850
 a warm side at 7 the crossover 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 on the upper part it is a 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.260
 very fluid body that is carved 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.630
 and sensual with well-muscled wings 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.240
 it gives him an athletic posture on 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.010
 has the impression that he will leap and on the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.500
 bottom part we have elements 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.650
 black protectors who reassures who 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.240
 express any way with a ski that 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.380
 sign very strongly also the face 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.100
 before that's really the spirit of the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.830
 car but finally we asked 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.470
 the ideas of all our design studios 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.140
 satellite all over the world and this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.960
 are r dc e our design studio at 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 bucharest and the cooperative laboratory 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.420
 of innovation here in paris who won 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.570
 this competition 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.480
 after we finished the design and the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.130
 concussion here in paris 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.990
 there was a lot of quality work 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.610
 perceived done on the car especially at 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.200
 level of side windows 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.580
 we have a chrome that makes the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.530
 around all the side life that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.510
 emphasizes both the fluidity of the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.130
 silhouette of the car his muscle without 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.170
 the back part is what romance does 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.940
 never interrupts and it takes 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.940
 really a refinement to the car 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 on the front we wished the 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.450
 chrome rim of the grille continue 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.910
 in the optical block and really pulls the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.010
 look at the car we find the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.510
 c-shaped light signature that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 had already been unveiled on the new 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.670
 space 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500
 this time the signature is 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.600
 much more dynamic we integrated it 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.540
 in a very solid chrome is the 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.950
 embarrassment a little crossover found at 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.910
 the back we put some magic with 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.230
 led technology 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.090
 we can now draw the light 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.610
 we created a luminous line that is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.650
 suspended in the void and thanks to that we 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.620
 can reproduce light shows and 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.490
 reflections daumas main saissac here 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.490
 to calm me down 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.100
 by the way these cars international 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.340
 do not know that destiny in europe 1 will be 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:22.680
 Also sold is made in China to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.660
 from 2007 the first impression 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.710
 it's already magic because this object 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.600
 which is part of the blank sheet 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.890
 they start to see the light of day and we did not 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.090
 that a haste is to see him in the street and 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.510
 to realize if we did well 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.090
 our job 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.850
 if you see the cadiÃ¨re you see a 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.270
 nice well proportioned car and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.640
 finally this home of true 4 4 6 1 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.830
 4 2 then a proposal really 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.970
 complete for families and who are at 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.970
 looking forward more
