00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.700 
than the bun you're putting on because
that<00:02:00.880> will<00:02:01.120> shrink<00:02:01.540> once<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.990> fat<00:02:02.290> inside

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
that will shrink once that fat inside

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.530 
that will shrink once that fat inside
starts<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.280> cook<00:02:03.490> down<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.880> render<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.300> little

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
starts to cook down and render a little

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.899 
starts to cook down and render a little
bit<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:05.200> will<00:02:05.470> shrink<00:02:05.830> in<00:02:06.010> size<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:06.580> just<00:02:06.760> keep

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
bit it will shrink in size so just keep

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.839 
bit it will shrink in size so just keep
repeating<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.360> process<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:08.590> your<00:02:09.129> patties
