00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.570 

there

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.330 

plan<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.470> got<00:03:04.590> fast<00:03:04.860> after<00:03:07.340> good

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
plan and it just got fast after good

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.210 
plan and it just got fast after good
kind<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.970> x<00:03:09.200> count<00:03:10.200> ourselves<00:03:10.440> trouble

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
kind of you x count ourselves trouble

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240 
kind of you x count ourselves trouble
with<00:03:12.260> grace<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:13.650> step<00:03:13.860> forward

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
with grace and then step forward

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.160 
with grace and then step forward
obviously<00:03:14.880> for<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.090> last<00:03:15.330> two<00:03:15.510> World<00:03:15.690> Cup<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
obviously for the last two World Cup so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.040 
obviously for the last two World Cup so
a<00:03:17.600> miracle<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.210> what<00:03:21.630> would<00:03:21.780> make<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
a miracle so so what would make the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.720 
a miracle so so what would make the
difference<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.770> one<00:03:22.980> compared<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.580> last

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
difference this one compared to the last

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.400 
difference this one compared to the last
because<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.720> could<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.990> both<00:03:25.140> wrote

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
because you could you both wrote

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.210 
because you could you both wrote
together<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:27.450> beijing<00:03:27.960> right<00:03:27.990> no<00:03:28.470> no<00:03:28.980> we

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
together and in beijing right no no we

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.830 
together and in beijing right no no we
haven't<00:03:30.000> okay<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.670> you're<00:03:32.670> gonna<00:03:32.760> think<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
haven't okay so you're gonna think the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.100 
haven't okay so you're gonna think the
difference<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.650> again<00:03:34.740> was<00:03:36.110> ticketed

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
difference this one again was ticketed

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.199 
difference this one again was ticketed
too<00:03:37.590> conservative<00:03:38.190> planning<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:40.040> bonfire

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
too conservative planning the bonfire

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.170 
too conservative planning the bonfire
and<00:03:42.209> effort<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:43.080> had<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.709> there<00:03:43.830> likes

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
and effort that we had in there likes

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.260 
and effort that we had in there likes
effectively<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
effectively so

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
effectively so
that's<00:03:46.810> something<00:03:47.560> that

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that's something that

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.589 
that's something that
so<00:03:48.620> all<00:03:48.920> three<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.459> us<00:03:49.670> Martin<00:03:50.000> right<00:03:50.299> I've

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
so all three of us Martin right I've

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.140 
so all three of us Martin right I've
been<00:03:50.780> working<00:03:51.049> on

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
been working on

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.420 
been working on
we<00:03:52.299> managed<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.200> make<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.620> work<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.920> images

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.350 

so<00:03:57.969> what<00:03:58.209> was<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.719> what<00:03:59.140> was<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.530> plan

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
so what was the what was the plan

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.570 
so what was the what was the plan
rayssa<00:04:01.960> rays<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.770> limits<00:04:03.130> not<00:04:03.310> involve

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
rayssa rays that are limits not involve

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.670 
rayssa rays that are limits not involve
our<00:04:03.670> limit<00:04:04.000> still<00:04:04.210> try<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.420> try<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.170> pull<00:04:05.410> some

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
our limit still try to try to pull some

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.470 
our limit still try to try to pull some
miracle<00:04:06.130> boots<00:04:06.430> or<00:04:06.640> anything<00:04:06.910> like<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.060> I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
miracle boots or anything like that I

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.750 
miracle boots or anything like that I
guess

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
guess

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.990 
guess
first<00:04:10.760> half<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.390> then

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.610 

energy<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.450> we<00:04:14.570> have<00:04:14.750> being<00:04:15.260> conservative

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
energy that we have being conservative

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.150 
energy that we have being conservative
in<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.040> second<00:04:16.340> half

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.010 

so<00:04:21.730> overall<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.150> mean<00:04:22.390> where<00:04:22.570> do<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.690> feel<00:04:22.870> you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
so overall I mean where do you feel you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.520 
so overall I mean where do you feel you
are<00:04:23.200> as<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:24.370> team<00:04:24.730> as<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.480> program<00:04:25.960> is<00:04:26.140> obviously

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
are as a team as a program is obviously

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.980 
are as a team as a program is obviously
this<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> big<00:04:27.100> step<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:27.760> what's<00:04:28.690> going<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
this is a big step but what's going to

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.820 
this is a big step but what's going to
happen<00:04:29.230> now<00:04:29.350> say<00:04:29.650> for<00:04:29.830> Copenhagen<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.720> think

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
happen now say for Copenhagen I think

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.790 
happen now say for Copenhagen I think
pretty<00:04:33.550> positive<00:04:33.820> because<00:04:34.210> up

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.239 

for<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.889> reason<00:04:42.190> we<00:04:42.520> were<00:04:42.669> still<00:04:43.600> able<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.990> me

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
for this reason we were still able to me

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.810 
for this reason we were still able to me
previous<00:04:45.999> results

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
previous results

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.660 
previous results
I<00:04:47.880> think

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.700 

more<00:04:53.090> healthy<00:04:53.420> ethnic<00:04:53.690> fest<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.110> that<00:04:54.320> when

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
more healthy ethnic fest of that when

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.540 
more healthy ethnic fest of that when
they<00:04:54.860> were<00:04:55.010> makes

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
they were makes

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.640 
they were makes
the<00:04:56.970> technical<00:04:57.480> attacked

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.239 

where<00:05:01.860> they<00:05:01.979> were<00:05:02.040> six<00:05:02.759> months<00:05:02.820> ago
