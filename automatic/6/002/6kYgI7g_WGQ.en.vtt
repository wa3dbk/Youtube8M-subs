hey<00:00:02.490> guys<00:00:02.730> hopefully<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.419> will<00:00:03.570> be<00:00:03.720> actually

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hey guys hopefully this will be actually

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.499 
hey guys hopefully this will be actually
in<00:00:04.380> focus<00:00:04.980> because<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.819> don't<00:00:05.970> know<00:00:06.089> how<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
in focus because I don't know how this

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.780 
in focus because I don't know how this
actually<00:00:06.930> kind<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.649> works<00:00:07.859> when<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.519> mirror

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
actually kind of works when the mirror

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.640 
actually kind of works when the mirror
bit<00:00:09.059> hopefully<00:00:09.480> isn't<00:00:09.900> focused<00:00:10.349> because

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
bit hopefully isn't focused because

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.169 
bit hopefully isn't focused because
otherwise<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.340> would<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.030> waste

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
otherwise it would be a bit of a waste

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.350 
otherwise it would be a bit of a waste
of<00:00:12.389> video<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.830> thinking<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.639> doing<00:00:14.670> it's

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
of video so I'm thinking of doing it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.090 
of video so I'm thinking of doing it's
just<00:00:15.570> kind<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.929> sorting<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.560> front<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> my

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
hair because at the moment my firend

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
hair because at the moment my firend
drawbridge<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.119> had<00:00:21.359> put<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.800> when<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> got

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
drawbridge that I had put in when I got

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.310

of<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.160> bit<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> range<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
of like a little bit of the range that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
of like a little bit of the range that
kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.449> merges<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.800> rest<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> my

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
generally what I do I just take a little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.149 
generally what I do I just take a little
bit<00:01:46.830> first<00:01:47.479> slice<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> small<00:01:48.960> layer<00:01:49.320> okay<00:01:49.950> you

bit first slice a small layer okay you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.590 
bit first slice a small layer okay you
can<00:01:50.310> imagine<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.180> separate

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
can imagine like you can just separate

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
can imagine like you can just separate
your<00:01:51.659> sections<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.470> generally<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.550> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
your sections I generally do it like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
your sections I generally do it like
that<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.569> find<00:01:54.929> my<00:01:55.110> even<00:01:55.409> though<00:01:55.530> it's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that because I find my even though it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.290 
that because I find my even though it's
a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.190> more<00:01:56.369> time-consuming

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
a little bit more time-consuming

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.809 
a little bit more time-consuming
I'm<00:01:58.050> able<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.610> doing

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
basically and generally might even like

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.710 
basically and generally might even like
things<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.399> don't<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.759> any<00:02:02.970> mistakes

even though you were only getting to
them<00:02:16.019> about<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.380> now<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.569> I'm<00:02:18.870> gonna<00:02:19.019> stop

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319

them about this now so I'm gonna stop
with<00:02:19.620> different<00:02:20.280> paths<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.180> furnace

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
with different paths of this furnace

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.410 
with different paths of this furnace
maybe<00:02:22.100> I'm<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.400> gonna<00:02:23.579> make<00:02:23.850> sure<00:02:23.910> my<00:02:24.120> it's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
maybe I'm just gonna make sure my it's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.560 
maybe I'm just gonna make sure my it's
all<00:02:24.540> straight<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
all straight and then I'm just going to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.070 
all straight and then I'm just going to
kind<00:02:27.570> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
kind of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.670 
kind of
to<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.920> oh<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:31.020> gives<00:02:31.170> more<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to it like this oh it gives more of a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.950 
to it like this oh it gives more of a
better<00:02:32.040> effect<00:02:32.520> rather<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.810> straight

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
better effect rather just going straight

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.930 
better effect rather just going straight
right<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> need<00:02:34.740> some<00:02:34.950> money

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.330 

okay<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.420> looks<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.960> lot<00:02:40.680> different<00:02:40.710> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
okay so that looks a lot different and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.130 
okay so that looks a lot different and
quite<00:02:41.760> nice<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.430> else<00:02:44.430> keep<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.240> I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
quite nice actually I else keep up I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
quite nice actually I else keep up I
think<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.590> came<00:02:46.770> out<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.370> end<00:02:47.520> up<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
think I came out this will end up and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.190 
think I came out this will end up and

careful with the longer parts of her

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.610 
careful with the longer parts of her
because<00:03:08.880> sometimes<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.630> really<00:03:10.110> easy

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
