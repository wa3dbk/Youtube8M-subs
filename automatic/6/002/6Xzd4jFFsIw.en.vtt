00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
 [Music] 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 but 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:21.670
 [Music] 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.460
 hello friends we are again the 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.650
 Welcome to our channel in our 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.279
 second video we will give one of several 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.930
 ways to make our molds 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.530
 we need with a sheet material or 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.410
 pom plates 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.140
 Opal cardboard or cartonboard 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.180
 metal scissors or cutter 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 standard work 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.690
 pencil backgrounds 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.550
 and our patterns that previously 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.550
 They were designed on bond sheets 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.990
 the first thing is to perform the transfer 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.960
 of our pattern design to the 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.809
 cardboard this we can do 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.570
 using decal paper and reviewing with 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.260
 a pencil the outline of the pattern 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 [Music] 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.730
 another way is to make a copy 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.710
 photostatic of our patterns 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.660
 directly on the cardboard or 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.790
 cartonboard 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.790
 [Music] 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.210
 since we have ready the transfer to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.740
 the cardboard then we can use 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.740
 scissors cutter 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.140
 we must cut the contour accurately 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:47.760
 Of the piece 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 [Music] 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.920
 It is recommended to use cardboard or 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
 cartonboard so that we molds 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.080
 work longer and that all our 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.080
 pieces of foami are exactly the same 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.070
 It is good that each mold has its own 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.319
 number or name and even better file in 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.600
 folders or bags the blows of each 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:19.490
 project that we have 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:22.970
 [Music] 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.700
 ready our mold we put it 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.670
 on top of the coming sheet and the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.830
 we mark either with a down with the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.830
 pencil or with a metal tip 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:52.070
 [Music] 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.100
 then the figure is cut with 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.350
 scissors or with the cutter trying cuts 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.350
 continuous and accurate material 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:17.259
 [Music] 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.860
 potatoes 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:57.610
 [Music] 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.620
 one of the advantages of the mold is that 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.380
 we can accommodate it to take advantage of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.260
 material and have the least waste 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.000
 possible I hope you liked it and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.590
 thank you very much and see you in the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:43.670
 next videos
