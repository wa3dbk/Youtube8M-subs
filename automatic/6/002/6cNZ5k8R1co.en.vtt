00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
start off with here just two regular a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
start off with here just two regular a
NURBS<00:00:27.269> plain<00:00:28.279> thing<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> want<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.699> make

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
NURBS plain thing is you want to make

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
NURBS plain thing is you want to make
sure<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.260> bit<00:00:31.380> above<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
sure that it is a little bit above the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.910 
sure that it is a little bit above the
grid<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.870> being<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.170> text<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
grid and being that I have text here it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
grid and being that I have text here it
isn't<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.430> matter<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> kind<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
isn't really matter that I kind of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.110 
isn't really matter that I kind of
attack<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> text<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.820> going

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
attack with the text because it's going

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.040 
attack with the text because it's going
to<00:00:39.860> serve<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> purpose<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.370> purpose<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.910> not

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
to serve the purpose of purpose of not

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.389 
to serve the purpose of purpose of not
being<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> grid<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> actually

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
being in the grid so when you actually

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
being in the grid so when you actually
paint<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:45.840> try<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
paint on it they will actually try to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
paint on it they will actually try to
paint<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> grid<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
paint on the grid and so when you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.970 
paint on the grid and so when you
actually<00:00:48.149> move<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:49.020> plane<00:00:49.350> around<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.890> would

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
actually move your plane around it would

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
actually move your plane around it would
not<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.579> will<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:51.059> spaces<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> these

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
not you will have spaces in it and these

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.170 
not you will have spaces in it and these
from<00:00:52.980> my<00:00:53.070> experience<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.110> it<00:00:55.110> won't<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:56.180> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
from my experience that it won't be it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.490 
from my experience that it won't be it
gives<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> issues<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> lot<00:00:58.350> better

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
gives you issues so it's a lot better

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
gives you issues so it's a lot better
just<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> grid<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.699> have<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
just to have it off the grid or have the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
just to have it off the grid or have the
grid<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.750> period<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.859> we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
grid off period and then we're going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
grid off period and then we're going to
go<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.280> render<00:01:02.760> any<00:01:02.910> gonna<00:01:03.059> hit<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> little

here<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.890> paint<00:01:41.100> operators<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
here we go so paint operators can go to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
here we go so paint operators can go to
smear<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> I'll<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:44.040> smear

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
smear and I'll see I can just now smear

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.700 
smear and I'll see I can just now smear
this<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.720> texture<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.560> painted

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
this this texture that I just painted

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.999 
this this texture that I just painted
right<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.780> nerves<00:01:48.780> plane<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
right here on to the nerves plane and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.749 
right here on to the nerves plane and
it's<00:01:50.430> also<00:01:50.579> bad<00:01:50.960> blur<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.159> blur<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.640> on

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's also bad blur you can blur it on

there

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.310 
there
and<00:01:55.159> this<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.420> under<00:01:56.630> paint<00:01:56.810> effects<00:01:57.079> and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and this is this under paint effects and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.760 
and this is this under paint effects and
under<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.280> under<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.200> artisan<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.649> also

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770

logo this kind of this shows you know
the<00:03:03.319> mixture<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.739> paint<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:06.100> paint

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
the mixture of paint in and paint

the mixture of paint in and paint
effects<00:03:07.510> which<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.630> really<00:03:08.810> cool<00:03:08.959> because<00:03:09.109> you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
effects which is really cool because you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.720 
effects which is really cool because you
can<00:03:09.319> put<00:03:09.530> them<00:03:09.650> right<00:03:09.769> together<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.609> know

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
can put them right together you know

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.180 
can put them right together you know
it's<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.350> if<00:03:12.350> you're<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.769> Photoshop

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
it's just like if you're in Photoshop

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's just like if you're in Photoshop
having<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.579> layer<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.819> texture<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.420> something

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
having to layer a texture on something

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.870 
having to layer a texture on something
that<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.019> painted<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.650> pulling<00:03:16.459> textures

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
that you painted and pulling textures

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.530 
that you painted and pulling textures
and<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.299> are<00:03:17.420> at<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.780> resolution<00:03:18.109> is<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
and that are at this resolution is a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.680 
and that are at this resolution is a
little<00:03:20.540> bit<00:03:20.660> more<00:03:20.720> tedious<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.600> also

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
little bit more tedious and you can also

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.879 
little bit more tedious and you can also
load<00:03:23.930> your<00:03:24.079> own<00:03:24.139> textures<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.680> which<00:03:24.799> is

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
load your own textures and which is

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.550 
load your own textures and which is
really<00:03:25.040> cool<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:27.109> takes<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.319> little<00:03:27.470> getting

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
really cool it takes a little getting

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.910 
really cool it takes a little getting
used<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:29.139> however<00:03:30.139> how<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.500> paint<00:03:30.709> effects

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
used to it however how the paint effects

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.289 
used to it however how the paint effects
work<00:03:31.100> because<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.459> gets<00:03:31.760> kind<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.030> sticky

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
work because it gets kind of sticky

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.870 
work because it gets kind of sticky
sometimes<00:03:32.660> where<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.930> feels<00:03:33.079> like<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.410> not

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
sometimes where it feels like it's not

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.059 
sometimes where it feels like it's not
going<00:03:34.880> out<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.450> but<00:03:35.989> just<00:03:36.410> got<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.010> kind
