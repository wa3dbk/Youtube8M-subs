00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
here's a quick demo of my homemade disk

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.960 
here's a quick demo of my homemade disk
sander<00:00:03.529> the<00:00:04.529> motor<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.520> power<00:00:05.759> switch

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
sander the motor and the power switch

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.230 
sander the motor and the power switch
were<00:00:06.270> taken<00:00:06.629> from<00:00:06.779> an<00:00:06.899> old<00:00:07.109> cheap<00:00:08.059> table<00:00:09.059> saw

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
were taken from an old cheap table saw

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.200 
were taken from an old cheap table saw
and<00:00:09.590> which<00:00:10.590> had<00:00:10.769> finally<00:00:11.370> rusted<00:00:11.730> through<00:00:11.759> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and which had finally rusted through so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.450 
and which had finally rusted through so
I<00:00:12.240> salvaged<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> motor<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.920> switch<00:00:14.219> where

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
I salvaged the motor and switch where

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.240 
I salvaged the motor and switch where
they're<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.880> good<00:00:15.030> condition<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.039> got<00:00:17.039> rid<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
they're in good condition and got rid of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.240 
they're in good condition and got rid of
the<00:00:17.490> rest<00:00:17.869> it's<00:00:18.869> currently<00:00:19.230> hooked<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the rest it's currently hooked up to a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.210 
the rest it's currently hooked up to a
small<00:00:21.180> shop<00:00:21.449> back<00:00:23.150> when<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.359> building<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
small shop back when I was building it I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
small shop back when I was building it I
was<00:00:26.220> deciding<00:00:26.910> whether<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.990> fixed

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
was deciding whether to use a fixed

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.049 
was deciding whether to use a fixed
table<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:30.890> just<00:00:31.890> abort<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.279> Bellini<00:00:32.820> end<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
table or a just abort a Bellini end I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.600 
table or a just abort a Bellini end I
decided<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> fixed<00:00:35.100> tables<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
decided that the fixed tables all I

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.130 
decided that the fixed tables all I
needed

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
needed

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
needed
save<00:00:37.140> lot<00:00:37.350> complexity<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> gave<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> lot

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
save lot complexity and gave it a lot

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.020 
save lot complexity and gave it a lot
more<00:00:38.790> rigidity<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.520> far<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
more rigidity so what they are far up

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.500 
more rigidity so what they are far up
now<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> demonstration<00:00:50.510> when

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
now and I can be a demonstration when

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
now and I can be a demonstration when
it's<00:00:51.660> running<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.379> still<00:00:52.770> pretty<00:00:52.980> quiet<00:00:53.399> but

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it's running it's still pretty quiet but

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
it's running it's still pretty quiet but
I've<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:54.989> shop<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.440> online<00:00:55.710> too

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I've just put the shop back online too

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:52.319 
I've just put the shop back online too
so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.340> add<00:00:56.670> those<00:00:56.879> prep<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.750> tough

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.350 

overall<00:01:53.329> very<00:01:53.360> pleased<00:01:53.869> with<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.229> sander<00:01:55.360> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
overall very pleased with the sander it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.169 
overall very pleased with the sander it
should<00:01:56.539> so<00:01:56.750> be<00:01:56.959> well<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:58.579> far<00:01:58.819> I<00:01:58.850> think<00:01:58.939> has

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
should so be well and so far I think has

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.569 
should so be well and so far I think has
cost<00:01:59.420> me<00:01:59.630> about<00:02:00.670> twenty<00:02:01.670> pounds<00:02:02.289> for<00:02:03.289> the

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
cost me about twenty pounds for the

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.199 
cost me about twenty pounds for the
backing<00:02:04.579> sheet<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:06.350> velcro<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.189> my<00:02:07.850> first

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
backing sheet of velcro and my first

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.100 
backing sheet of velcro and my first
sounding<00:02:08.539> disc

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
sounding disc

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.170 
sounding disc
I<00:02:10.720> used<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.170> hook<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.040> loop<00:02:13.190> ones<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
I used the hook and loop ones to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.500 
I used the hook and loop ones to
changing<00:02:14.630> hue<00:02:15.019> fairly<00:02:15.349> easy
