00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.130
 This is 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.719
 now at 2 TV we are here at approx 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.240
 can see more than once more 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.030
 I have a Therapist Rescue with Dementia Elser from FM Art Allofs only though 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.600
 Replacement Jantscher Montag took place and welcome! Thank you 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.300
 most likely such a Sonnyboy pressed into the hand that's such a premiere, then 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.220
 What is this about, yes, that's what I explain to him 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.560
 like to know the so-called transporter's base 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 and Russia and security system it not 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.390
 the Taunus mobile and I would him in the first step just the easy 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.420
 Assembly and disassembly 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.650
 will keep this system 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.210
 Yates Kerner 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 then the last time will be here below 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.050
 Recording stuck but since they have about 1 off a pin Yalom is one 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.450
 corresponding counterpart 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.760
 and then it goes over a quick release clamped up 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 closed and already this distance is fixed in the vehicle and before 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.680
 as fast 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.860
 did not arrive 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.740
 remove again 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.880
 so here's the first impression of the federal government the difference in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.000
 our system 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.950
 becomes clear before other systems 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 we are concerned that we have high mobility dog 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.760
 the simplicity it is and the ability to expand the system 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.750
 at any time 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.770
 in and in principle, as in the past so beautifully said 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.600
 easy operation 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.869
 Pröll sees that we like to stay here, we have Siro on the other side 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.420
 Act and that is just as we just shown 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.320
 Now this is fixed so tight and that was already 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 everything has been this young shop between boys 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.060
 the app shows exactly to know we need each two posts if we have one 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.730
 this complete unit 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.719
 that is with these points 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.640
 wait with these places 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.850
 are fixed in the floor under the roof 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.990
 beautiful hip appropriate shelves are used so that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 Band end effect this kept advised 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.430
 is fixed 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.840
 without the vehicle's body being damaged without a screw 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.269
 necessary is 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.780
 By pure glue and the burdock mechanism according to each other 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.039
 connected and then can 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.899
 Sutters are also easily removed without residue 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.760
 Return of the vehicle no damage in the vehicle 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.859
 through the obligation to advise from the start 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.439
 I also see the one meter slide here 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.389
 aap deep from the plains that means year over which deep I am now 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.829
 Here lived that is the variant 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.059
 with the 400 ten millimeters we already have 3 in the principle or propose i5 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:43.259
 that means around 410 the 310 the 210 millimeters that are common dimensions so 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.609
 that actually all the containers in the market 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.829
 Red are present accordingly 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.119
 can be imported and stored here 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.469
 suddenly open again 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.169
 Schildhauer boxes parked here quite normal boxes, of course, lives here 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.849
 Reason why he also originally come our systems which of course you too 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.420
 marvelous in this system 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.859
 Minden kn 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.090
 and so to speak, the thing mobility we have in our systems with the 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.569
 Boxes that you can link stacks together 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.380
 that now once again a vehicle be merged 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.130
 in the form of a load securing and a closed system then form with it 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.740
 where the customer in our view has a scorn dozen 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.609
 that's one thing 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.319
 the appeals mechanism with velcro what about the looks 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.120
 Safety standards, yes, good that I appeal 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.980
 Invitation yourself from the system 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.680
 must of course be offered if it lives right picture tested Wick 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.280
 checked is of course we have crash test 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.299
 performed sore 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.730
 the system had load securing approved by the Dekra that is quite a 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.599
 very important story Mr. Banga because this system is introduced to the market 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
 We will start now in April 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.170
 ple April 2007 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.569
 and will then match these systems through specialty retailers 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.699
 can market 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.939
 From our point of view, Löw also knows the advantage of this system 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.870
 the simple handling 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.180
 the easy one the customer of the trade can itself this system then a tree 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.289
 So what you see here with the three shelves 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.379
 I would guess between one and a half and two hours 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.979
 finished with that and they saw it quite a bit of installing and expanding then who 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.369
 with the configured system that works much faster you just solve it 

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:33.639
 correspond to the quick release 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.169
 Tip TuS Nentershausen and within a few minutes Hartmanns expanded and 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.440
 appropriate Taylor reinstated who can he makes all the bigger ones 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.120
 Materials transport flash mob at the parade and and and 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.590
 Place with more 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.610
 that's very very very innovative story I think so and I hope 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.590
 also that our viewers find that way thanks the first sentence and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.910
 Wish him good luck with the launch of this new product 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.199
 Thanks a lot to fruits what 2 TV from international 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.500
