 to see ezequiel very well ezequiel if well 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:40.010
 it goes serving as measuring your 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.960
 excess energy if it's jumping into the vacuum if 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.060
 abigail you had very well you owe a lot 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.680

 you have to follow very very very very soon 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.770
 disposition is a subject that has a lot 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.350
 mischief and that's where they have to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.970
 keep grabbing and maybe it serves them 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.950
 when they touch the topics look for a 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.360
 little some versions or whatever for 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.640
 have to do because if they do not always go 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.710
 to be imprisoned is a ballad is a 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.400
 tempo and this song is from a movie 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.740
 I say something happens that can help them use 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.669
 the tools for the best of the 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.669
 night thanks

 good 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.550
 If I think they were the best 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.260
 they sang in English they sing both very 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.750
 all right 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.070
 ezequiel I really liked your energy 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.080
 you have to measure a bit to go growing 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.600
 because at the beginning if you put all the 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.930
 energy they fall but I liked them a lot 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 the two and good congratulations and 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.190

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.070
 Ezequiel 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.130
 good they took advantage of an excellent topic that 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.169
 it's so they can really look 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:08.139
 I think they were encouraged that there was a 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:10.210
 attitude that I put a commitment to him 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.850
 They put claw that was nice to see and 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.620
 that was very nice to hear is 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.210
 say we did we had this level with 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.620
 all the participants the projects 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.090
 that we will feast on the days 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.580
 Saturdays and we would all be running 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.620
 behind the television so I love it 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.540
 what they have done I know that this is what 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.060
 minimum and this is the floor of what they are going to 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.610
 do because we obviously expect that 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.669
 for the next one directly that we do 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.550
 defendants on this site but what 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:39.570

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.570
 I put a very note 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.990

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.290

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.959
 at the end of the night 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:57.330
 here nobody loses salt 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.770
 but also in individual score 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.370
 for each one that they are going to take to 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.370
 your own duo standings 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.370
 but
