 he wants us this is the new range 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.620
 it's not that it's a new range in 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.190
 anyway it's a 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.470
 so the biko highway that has the 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.939
 particularity to be very beautiful and to be 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.550
 by high-end apart completely 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.750
 upscale but married a little bit 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.970
 hybrid this phone what there are 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.710

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.250
 and others 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 so he has one for all aluminum very 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 So pretty and the room upscale 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 a tempered glass rear window so 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 that's really 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.970
 we find a screen 2 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.680
 5 inches 1080p 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.750
 gorilla glass 2 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.070
 a processor 8 hearts cuda cores of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.590
 gigaset of media library 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.630
 he has a 16-megapixel camera 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.130
 here you are who is very pretty very 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 well integrated to the hull and a device 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.940
 front photo of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.880
 8 megapixels we can take the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.910
 photos years mental 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.750
 8 million pixels it has 16 giga of 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.470
 internal storage of giga of ram 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.330
 that was for the party 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.350
 rather high-end but in my opinion 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 to keep a price extremely 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 competitive they had to do some 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 concessions 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 for example we are packaged here 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.170
 like that it's said he's just 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.640
 3g h lower than 4g surely for 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.100
 keep a very good price because my 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.100
 opinion it sticks commercialized at the price 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.820
 my opinion to do very very badly 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.480
 what I think a lot of people who 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 mathieu them 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.189
 to have a phone 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.189
 top of the line 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.720
 what else do we have 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.260
 android 4 points two points 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.520

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.520

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.430
 phones this one being 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.659
 almost to the diamond being part of 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.159
 high- end chirico there is no 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.900
 of reason 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.430
 there are no reasons why 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.080
 do not update then we stay at 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.729
 know if they will really do it and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.440
 if the bottom is what it will be towards 4 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.630
 points 3 or 4 points head in the ideal 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.420
 it's small infos to follow closely 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.080
 in any case hardware level this phone 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.720
 is extremely pretty 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.170

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.440

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.110

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.190
