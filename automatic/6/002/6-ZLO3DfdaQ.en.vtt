what's up guys welcome to wasted space

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.619 
what's up guys welcome to wasted space
and<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.399> back<00:00:02.490> in<00:00:02.550> space<00:00:02.909> engineers<00:00:03.419> and

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
and we're back in space engineers and

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.390 
and we're back in space engineers and
seeing<00:00:03.870> us<00:00:04.080> it's<00:00:04.350> quite<00:00:04.620> busy<00:00:04.799> leading<00:00:05.069> up<00:00:05.279> to

Christmas and I'm a really boring bit of
the<00:00:07.830> production<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> carrier<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
the production of the carrier at the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.040 
the production of the carrier at the
moment<00:00:09.360> where<00:00:09.480> I'm<00:00:09.570> doing<00:00:09.809> all<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
moment where I'm doing all the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.980 
moment where I'm doing all the
structural<00:00:10.440> work<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.040> thought<00:00:11.730> I'd<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> quick

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
structural work I thought I'd do a quick

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.720 
structural work I thought I'd do a quick
video<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.559> show<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.190> intend<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
submit for the exploration mode that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
submit for the exploration mode that
keen<00:00:18.060> software<00:00:18.270> house<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.840> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> asking

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
keen software house are kind of asking

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.870 
keen software house are kind of asking
for<00:00:19.619> stuff<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:20.010> submitted<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> moment

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
for stuff to be submitted at the moment

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.060 
for stuff to be submitted at the moment
in<00:00:21.510> particular<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.080> Thursday<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.740> asked<00:00:23.039> for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
in particular on Thursday they asked for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
in particular on Thursday they asked for
stuff<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.430> was<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> faction

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
stuff that was kind of faction

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.920 
stuff that was kind of faction
orientated<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> limited<00:00:26.820> within<00:00:27.090> some<00:00:27.390> terms

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
orientated and limited within some terms

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.050 
orientated and limited within some terms
of<00:00:28.199> constraints<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
of constraints so what we have here is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.640 
of constraints so what we have here is
what<00:00:30.359> I've<00:00:30.480> sort<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> come<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
what I've sort of come up with for that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.940 
what I've sort of come up with for that
and<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:31.980> take<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.950> mining

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and my take on it was to do a mining

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000 
and my take on it was to do a mining
corporation<00:00:35.579> base<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.570> small<00:00:37.350> outpost<00:00:37.800> base

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
corporation base so small outpost base

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.209 
corporation base so small outpost base
that<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> case<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> W<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.530> extraction

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that in this case the W for extraction

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.639 
that in this case the W for extraction
group<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:42.090> set<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.840> somewhere<00:00:43.379> near<00:00:43.559> an

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
group have set up out somewhere near an

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.979 
group have set up out somewhere near an
asteroid<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:45.000> manage<00:00:45.600> their<00:00:45.780> mining

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
asteroid to manage their mining

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
asteroid to manage their mining
operations<00:00:46.559> refine<00:00:46.890> their<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.700> send

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
operations refine their or and then send

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.750 
operations refine their or and then send
it<00:00:48.059> back<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.840> main<00:00:49.020> operations<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.340> I've

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it back to the main operations so I've

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
it back to the main operations so I've
gone<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.199> grey<00:00:52.770> orange<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
gone we the kind of this grey orange and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
gone we the kind of this grey orange and
black<00:00:53.879> theme<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> try<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> going

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
black theme and try to keep that going

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.450 
black theme and try to keep that going
through<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> things<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
through this is one of the things that

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.160 
through this is one of the things that
keen<00:00:56.699> were<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.120> interested<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
keen were really interested in was that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
keen were really interested in was that
the<00:00:58.680> design<00:00:59.039> should<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.370> consistent<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the design should be consistent and so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
the design should be consistent and so
here<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:01.980> mining<00:01:02.250> crafts

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
here is one of my little mining crafts

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
here is one of my little mining crafts
and<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> these<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.629> they're

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and there are two of these on they're

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
and there are two of these on they're
very<00:01:04.409> very<00:01:04.559> basic<00:01:04.949> things<00:01:05.280> might<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.549> quite

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
very very basic things might do quite

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
very very basic things might do quite
well<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.000> replace<00:01:06.299> my<00:01:06.600> basic<00:01:07.020> mining<00:01:07.290> craft

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
well to replace my basic mining craft

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.250 
well to replace my basic mining craft
video<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.070> fact<00:01:08.570> nothing<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
video in fact nothing much do them a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.480 
video in fact nothing much do them a
couple<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.560> drills<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> front<00:01:11.130> feet<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
couple of drills on the front feet on

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550 
couple of drills on the front feet on
the<00:01:11.580> bottom<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> connector<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the bottom and connector on the back and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
the bottom and connector on the back and
I've<00:01:13.740> gone<00:01:13.950> again<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> orange<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> grey

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I've gone again for the orange and grey

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
I've gone again for the orange and grey
motif<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> side<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.220> we've<00:01:17.369> got

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
motif and on the side there we've got

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
motif and on the side there we've got
these<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:19.140> shape<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.210> that's<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.930> what

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
these this shape and that's kind of what

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
these this shape and that's kind of what
I've<00:01:22.200> done<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> theme<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I've done is the theme for things so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.480 
I've done is the theme for things so
that<00:01:23.880> shape<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.479> repeated<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.170> over<00:01:25.490> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that shape is repeated all over this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
that shape is repeated all over this
structure<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.420> over<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> ships<00:01:28.080> around

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
structure and all over the ships around

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
structure and all over the ships around
it<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.890> jump<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> go

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it so if I just jump out of this and go

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.230 
it so if I just jump out of this and go
for<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.780> tour<00:01:31.079> around<00:01:31.110> inside

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
for a little tour around inside

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.340 
for a little tour around inside
obviously<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.329> got<00:01:33.420> full<00:01:33.600> gravity<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.229> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
obviously we got full gravity so this is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.520 
obviously we got full gravity so this is
the<00:01:34.470> main<00:01:34.770> deck<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.420> our

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the main deck and in here we have our

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.920 
the main deck and in here we have our
kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.460> core<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
kind of the the the core of the the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
kind of the the the core of the the
outpost<00:01:40.290> itself<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.549> mains<00:01:42.119> cargo

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
outpost itself which is the mains cargo

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
outpost itself which is the mains cargo
storage<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> main<00:01:43.409> reactor<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> these

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
storage and the main reactor and these

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
storage and the main reactor and these
are<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> decided<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.380> floating

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
are no I decided to have them floating

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.370 
are no I decided to have them floating
over<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.340> deck<00:01:47.610> below<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.600> wander<00:01:49.290> around

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
over the deck below so we wander around

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
over the deck below so we wander around
obviously<00:01:49.920> around<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.460> side<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
obviously around this side is a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
obviously around this side is a
duplicate<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> type<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.380> been<00:01:52.500> on

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
duplicate of the type of just been on

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.100 
duplicate of the type of just been on
although<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.939> minor<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.540> side<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
although the minor on this side is

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
although the minor on this side is
actually<00:01:55.770> connected<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> conveyor

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
actually connected up to the conveyor

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
actually connected up to the conveyor
system<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> things<00:01:58.350> I've<00:01:58.590> done

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
system and one of the things I've done

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
system and one of the things I've done
here<00:01:59.130> which<00:01:59.310> I'll<00:01:59.490> show<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.640> downstairs<00:02:00.149> is

here which I'll show you downstairs is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.200 
here which I'll show you downstairs is
there<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> sense<00:02:02.009> system<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> tell<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
constraints that keen put on us was that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.860 
constraints that keen put on us was that
we<00:02:10.950> weren't<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.239> were<00:02:12.360> encouraged

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
we weren't really or we were encouraged

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.490 
we weren't really or we were encouraged
not<00:02:13.170> to

not to
rotors<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.370> pistons<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.210> we<00:02:15.720> were<00:02:15.810> encouraged

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
rotors or pistons and we were encouraged

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.480 
rotors or pistons and we were encouraged
to<00:02:16.230> keep<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> designs<00:02:16.830> within<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.310> certain

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
to keep the designs within a certain

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.640 
to keep the designs within a certain
number<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.850> triangles<00:02:18.210> what<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.140> meant<00:02:19.380> was

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
number of triangles what this meant was

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.140 
number of triangles what this meant was
that<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.610> inventive

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
that you have to be kind of inventive

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.850 
that you have to be kind of inventive
with<00:02:21.300> what<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.660> did<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.320> place<00:02:22.530> cool

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
with what you did to make the place cool

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
with what you did to make the place cool
so<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:23.910> coming<00:02:24.240> down<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> med<00:02:24.900> bay

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
so this is coming down into a med bay

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.450 
so this is coming down into a med bay
and<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.560> things<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.860> did<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.100> try<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
and one of the things I did to try and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.690 
and one of the things I did to try and
make<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.610> cool<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:27.180> every<00:02:27.510> door<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
make it cool was every door in here is

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.920 
make it cool was every door in here is
sensor<00:02:29.700> activated<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.600> actually<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
sensor activated now this is actually a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.030 
sensor activated now this is actually a
little<00:02:31.020> reminder<00:02:31.320> leave<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> stairs<00:02:31.890> with

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
little reminder leave the stairs with

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.800 
little reminder leave the stairs with
nothing<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.490> because<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:33.420> weren't<00:02:33.600> allowed

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
nothing in it because we weren't allowed

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.510 
nothing in it because we weren't allowed
to<00:02:33.870> use<00:02:34.080> mods<00:02:34.410> either<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:34.950> there's<00:02:35.130> only<00:02:35.220> so

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
to use mods either so there's only so

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.280 
to use mods either so there's only so
much<00:02:35.700> decorating<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.660> making<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.959> look<00:02:37.020> cool

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
much decorating and making it look cool

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.199 
much decorating and making it look cool
I<00:02:37.320> felt<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.950> know<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.250> felt<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.880> could<00:02:39.060> do

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
I felt like you know I felt I could do

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.850 
I felt like you know I felt I could do
without<00:02:39.450> repeating<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.260> over<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.530> over<00:02:40.650> again

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
without repeating it over and over again

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.410 
without repeating it over and over again
and<00:02:41.010> without<00:02:41.310> breaking<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> other

and without breaking one of the other
rules<00:02:42.690> which<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.230> make<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.500> thing

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
rules which was to make the thing

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.680 
rules which was to make the thing
overpowered<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:44.850> come<00:02:44.970> down<00:02:45.120> here<00:02:45.180> into<00:02:45.510> my

assemblers<00:02:54.360> round<00:02:54.600> here<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.959> down<00:02:55.770> here<00:02:55.800> are

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
assemblers round here and down here are

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.250 
assemblers round here and down here are
sort<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.820> main<00:02:57.030> control<00:02:57.390> Bay<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.810> something

sort of main control Bay with something

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.180 
sort of main control Bay with something
like<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.380> tried<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> make<00:02:58.860> look<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.160> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
like I tried to make look like a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
like I tried to make look like a
computer<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.420> these<00:03:00.570> blue<00:03:00.780> lights<00:03:01.020> here

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
computer but these blue lights here

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.410 
computer but these blue lights here
represent<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.160> platforms<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.790> top<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.270> at<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
represent the platforms up top so at the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.910 
represent the platforms up top so at the
moment<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.590> right<00:03:04.739> hand

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
moment you can see the right hand

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.280 
moment you can see the right hand
platform<00:03:05.340> has<00:03:05.459> got<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> ship<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.570> center

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
platform has got a ship on it the center

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.229 
platform has got a ship on it the center
platform<00:03:07.800> has<00:03:08.190> got<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> ship<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
platform has got a ship on it and the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.060 
platform has got a ship on it and the
left-hand<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.080> one<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.350> started<00:03:10.739> off<00:03:10.830> by

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
left-hand one the one we started off by

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.060 
left-hand one the one we started off by
does<00:03:11.670> not<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.180> one's<00:03:12.360> just<00:03:12.450> parked<00:03:12.930> up<00:03:13.110> so

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
does not that one's just parked up so

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.290 
does not that one's just parked up so
this<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.340> kind<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> other<00:03:14.790> thing<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.090> tried

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
this was kind of the other thing I tried

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.699 
this was kind of the other thing I tried
to<00:03:15.420> do<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.660> make<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:16.560> bit

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
to do to make it a little bit

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.979 
to do to make it a little bit
interactive<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> little<00:03:17.640> bit<00:03:17.730> cool<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> I

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
interactive and a little bit cool so I

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.120 
interactive and a little bit cool so I
just<00:03:19.170> look<00:03:19.350> around<00:03:19.440> down<00:03:19.680> here<00:03:19.739> there's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
just look around down here there's

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.860 
just look around down here there's
nothing<00:03:20.310> much<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.940> these<00:03:21.150> they<00:03:21.480> were<00:03:21.510> just

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
nothing much in these they were just

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.560 
nothing much in these they were just
used<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.680> kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> hide<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.640> conveyor<00:03:24.150> system

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
used to kind of hide the conveyor system

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.300 
used to kind of hide the conveyor system
that<00:03:24.660> leads<00:03:24.750> down<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.230> turrets<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.190> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
that leads down to the turrets that are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.039 
that leads down to the turrets that are
on<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> bottom<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> ship<00:03:27.120> bottom<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
on the bottom of the ship bottom of the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.660 
on the bottom of the ship bottom of the
outpost<00:03:28.350> sorry<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.040> again<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.549> was<00:03:29.640> a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
outpost sorry and again there was a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.100 
outpost sorry and again there was a
constraint<00:03:30.090> there<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.540> kind<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.900> tried

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
constraint there that we kind of tried

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.750 
constraint there that we kind of tried
to<00:03:31.140> make<00:03:31.410> things<00:03:31.459> realistic<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.610> not

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
to make things realistic and not

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.850 
to make things realistic and not
overpowered<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.630> there's<00:03:34.200> not<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> huge<00:03:34.739> number

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
overpowered so there's not a huge number

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.400 
overpowered so there's not a huge number
of<00:03:35.220> turrets<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.230> everything<00:03:37.230> is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
of turrets on this everything is

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.530 
of turrets on this everything is
conveyed<00:03:38.040> together<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.610> course<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.390> one

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
conveyed together of course that was one

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.850 
conveyed together of course that was one
of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> requirements<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.320> was<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.500> fully

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
of the requirements and it was all fully

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.610 
of the requirements and it was all fully
survival<00:03:41.430> survival<00:03:41.970> compatible<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.410> fact

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
survival survival compatible so in fact

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 
survival survival compatible so in fact
if<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.799> go<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.250> go<00:03:44.400> out<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.030> top<00:03:45.360> floor<00:03:45.600> now

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
if you go we go out to the top floor now

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
if you go we go out to the top floor now
which<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.260> sort<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.500> last<00:03:46.709> area<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:48.060> up<00:03:48.600> on

which is the sort of last area and up on
the<00:03:48.870> top<00:03:49.049> floor<00:03:49.320> we've<00:03:49.709> got<00:03:49.980> where<00:03:50.370> are<00:03:50.670> sort

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000

ready for survival so here we have this
one<00:04:07.680> just<00:04:08.670> has<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.120> cargo<00:04:09.959> containers<00:04:10.320> on<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
one just has the cargo containers on the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.810 
one just has the cargo containers on the
side<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.950> conveyor<00:04:11.280> system<00:04:11.670> for<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
turrets on the roof on the other side

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.830 
turrets on the roof on the other side
around<00:04:14.070> here<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.610> our<00:04:14.730> battery<00:04:15.180> room<00:04:15.420> so

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
around here this is our battery room so

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.509 
around here this is our battery room so
we<00:04:16.350> have<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> series<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.859> batteries<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.489> here

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
we have a series of batteries in here

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.420 
we have a series of batteries in here
that<00:04:18.419> i<00:04:18.450> have<00:04:18.840> actually<00:04:19.140> forgotten<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.979> put<00:04:20.190> on

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
that i have actually forgotten to put on

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.780 
that i have actually forgotten to put on
to<00:04:20.760> charge

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.390 

there<00:04:24.790> we<00:04:24.880> go<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.380> yeah<00:04:26.380> same<00:04:26.650> idea<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:27.100> these

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
there we go and yeah same idea so these

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.680 
there we go and yeah same idea so these
containers<00:04:27.940> although<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.420> it's<00:04:28.540> actually

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
containers although if it's actually

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.270 
containers although if it's actually
this<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.320> or<00:04:29.470> one<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.800> other<00:04:29.920> small

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
this one or one of the other small

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.650 
this one or one of the other small
containers<00:04:30.760> around<00:04:30.940> here<00:04:31.240> they<00:04:31.480> have

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
containers around here they have

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.780 
containers around here they have
weaponry<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.830> welders<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.340> them<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.550> again

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
weaponry and welders in them and again

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.910 
weaponry and welders in them and again
we<00:04:33.970> weren't<00:04:34.270> allowed<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.540> put<00:04:34.810> too<00:04:35.020> much<00:04:35.350> stuff

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
we weren't allowed to put too much stuff

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.190 
we weren't allowed to put too much stuff
around<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.400> place<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:36.970> I've<00:04:37.570> also<00:04:37.810> got<00:04:38.170> a

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
around the place so I've also got a

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.830 
around the place so I've also got a
little<00:04:38.410> bit<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.650> or<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:40.330> on<00:04:40.480> kicking

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
little bit of or and so on kicking

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.510 
little bit of or and so on kicking
around<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.410> as<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> reward<00:04:41.770> for<00:04:42.130> coming

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
around in here as a reward for coming

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.550 
around in here as a reward for coming
and<00:04:42.610> capturing<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.420> then<00:04:43.960> finally<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
and capturing it and then finally in the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.200 
and capturing it and then finally in the
last<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.100> ships<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.730> one<00:04:45.910> up<00:04:46.030> here

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
last of the ships is this one up here

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.060 
last of the ships is this one up here
and<00:04:46.390> under<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.290> can<00:04:47.410> see<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.590> sensor

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
and under there you can see the sensor

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.400 
and under there you can see the sensor
for<00:04:48.190> this<00:04:48.340> central<00:04:48.970> Bay<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.450> this<00:04:50.140> is<00:04:50.260> my

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
for this central Bay and this is my

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.380 
for this central Bay and this is my
cargo<00:04:50.740> ship<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.010> again<00:04:51.460> we've<00:04:52.030> kept<00:04:52.270> that

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
cargo ship and again we've kept that

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.540 
cargo ship and again we've kept that
sort<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.660> same<00:04:52.900> theme<00:04:53.410> running<00:04:54.010> through<00:04:54.370> this

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
sort of same theme running through this

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.160 
sort of same theme running through this
as<00:04:54.760> well<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.270> same<00:04:55.420> color<00:04:55.690> design<00:04:55.960> also

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
as well so the same color design also

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.770 
as well so the same color design also
the<00:04:56.410> same<00:04:56.530> sort<00:04:56.830> of<00:04:56.860> shapes<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:58.570> idea

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
the same sort of shapes and the idea

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.940 
the same sort of shapes and the idea
behind<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:59.110> is<00:04:59.170> that<00:04:59.290> this<00:04:59.590> would<00:04:59.770> be<00:04:59.800> the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
behind this is that this would be the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.920 
behind this is that this would be the
vessel<00:05:00.100> that<00:05:00.550> actually<00:05:01.240> once<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.570> oars<00:05:01.720> been

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
vessel that actually once the oars been

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.200 
vessel that actually once the oars been
processed<00:05:02.440> takes<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.100> back<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:04.060> main

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
processed takes it back to the the main

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.120 
processed takes it back to the the main
supply<00:05:04.630> rather<00:05:05.020> than<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.350> hanging<00:05:05.650> around<00:05:05.920> on

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
supply rather than it hanging around on

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.670 
supply rather than it hanging around on
this<00:05:06.280> base<00:05:06.570> that's<00:05:07.570> er<00:05:07.750> that's<00:05:08.020> kind<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.560> it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
this base that's er that's kind of it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.290 
this base that's er that's kind of it
for<00:05:08.830> today<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> thought<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.490> was<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> kind<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.060> a

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
for today I thought it was a kind of a

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.210 
for today I thought it was a kind of a
cool<00:05:10.870> looking<00:05:11.140> base<00:05:11.380> I<00:05:11.560> tried<00:05:11.800> very<00:05:11.980> hard<00:05:12.010> to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
cool looking base I tried very hard to

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.130 
cool looking base I tried very hard to
get<00:05:12.370> into<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.670> theme<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:13.060> what<00:05:13.660> they<00:05:14.080> were

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
get into the theme of what they were

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.480 
get into the theme of what they were
looking<00:05:14.320> for<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.890> make<00:05:15.040> this<00:05:15.160> look<00:05:15.430> like

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
looking for you and make this look like

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.970 
looking for you and make this look like
it<00:05:15.880> is<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.030> factions<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.720> only<00:05:16.990> these<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.680> W

to stay a space engineers no worries

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.450 
to stay a space engineers no worries
that's<00:05:41.620> going<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.830> be<00:05:41.890> exactly<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.280> same<00:05:42.310> but

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
that's going to be exactly the same but

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.860 
that's going to be exactly the same but

want<00:05:47.410> to<00:05:47.470> see<00:05:47.650> kind<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.490> my<00:05:48.700> thoughts<00:05:48.910> at<00:05:49.150> the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
want to see kind of my thoughts at the

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.560 
want to see kind of my thoughts at the
moment<00:05:49.240> are<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.930> could<00:05:50.740> do<00:05:50.920> a<00:05:51.220> series<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.240> a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
moment are I could do a series on a

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.640 
moment are I could do a series on a
different<00:05:52.960> game<00:05:53.080> maybe<00:05:53.290> one<00:05:53.500> that's

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
different game maybe one that's

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.920 
different game maybe one that's
connected<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.160> base<00:05:55.000> engineers<00:05:55.480> in<00:05:55.600> some<00:05:55.810> way

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
connected to base engineers in some way

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.300 
connected to base engineers in some way
so<00:05:55.990> for<00:05:56.260> example<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.650> am<00:05:56.680> playing<00:05:57.010> a<00:05:57.130> bit<00:05:57.250> of

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
so for example I am playing a bit of

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.980 
so for example I am playing a bit of
elite<00:05:57.490> dangerous<00:05:57.730> at<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.210> moment<00:05:58.510> would<00:05:58.930> you

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
elite dangerous at the moment would you

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.150 
elite dangerous at the moment would you
guys<00:05:59.170> be<00:05:59.380> interested<00:05:59.470> in<00:05:59.800> seeing<00:05:59.950> that

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
guys be interested in seeing that

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.610 
guys be interested in seeing that
another<00:06:00.850> option<00:06:01.060> would<00:06:01.270> be<00:06:01.390> for<00:06:01.540> me<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.320> do

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620
