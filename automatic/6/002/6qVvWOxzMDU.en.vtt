00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
a blog post we did about a year ago talk

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.420 
a blog post we did about a year ago talk
about<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> way<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:37.860> virtual

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
about the way in which virtual

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.619 
about the way in which virtual
environments<00:00:38.820> such<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.180> might<00:00:39.450> actually

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
environments such as this might actually

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.500 
environments such as this might actually
be<00:00:39.809> used<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> visualize<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.430> real<00:00:41.700> next<00:00:42.210> moon

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
be used to visualize the real next moon

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
be used to visualize the real next moon
landing<00:00:42.930> sometime<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> next<00:00:43.829> decade<00:00:44.250> or

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
landing sometime in the next decade or

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
landing sometime in the next decade or
so<00:00:45.020> here<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.469> rules<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> sim<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so here we have the rules of the sim the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.310 
so here we have the rules of the sim the
most<00:00:47.460> important<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.840> must<00:00:49.110> wear

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
most important one is that you must wear

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.750 
most important one is that you must wear
a<00:00:49.350> spacesuit<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
a spacesuit when you're down on the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
a spacesuit when you're down on the
surface<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.480> please<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> X<00:00:52.469> street<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.890> bio

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
surface so please go to X street and bio

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
surface so please go to X street and bio
space<00:00:53.460> suit<00:00:53.640> before<00:00:53.969> heading<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.539> there's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
space suit before heading down there's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840 
space suit before heading down there's
also<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.829> head-up<00:00:55.980> display<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.760> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
also a head-up display which would be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
also a head-up display which would be
important<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
important so to actually get the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.189 
important so to actually get the
educational<00:00:58.800> value<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> simulation<00:01:00.199> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
educational value from the simulation so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.389 
educational value from the simulation so
if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.440> mind<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> go

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
if you don't mind I'm now going to go

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.930 
if you don't mind I'm now going to go
and<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.670> changed<00:01:02.910> into<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.600> space<00:01:03.899> suit

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.120 

we're<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:08.960> going<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.200> head<00:01:09.320> over<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:10.100> of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
we're now going to head over to one of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.550 
we're now going to head over to one of
the<00:01:10.280> two<00:01:10.430> teleports<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.180> just<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.140> tips<00:01:12.410> for

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the two teleports and just the tips for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.950 
the two teleports and just the tips for
the<00:01:12.620> teleporters<00:01:13.130> normal<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.630> he'll<00:01:14.630> be<00:01:14.720> sent

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
the teleporters normal and he'll be sent

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.490 
the teleporters normal and he'll be sent
down<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.290> surface<00:01:17.020> okay<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:18.140> important

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
down to the surface okay it's important

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.830 
down to the surface okay it's important
when<00:01:18.620> you're<00:01:18.770> on<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.310> surface<00:01:19.760> to<00:01:20.090> set<00:01:20.630> your

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
when you're on the surface to set your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.930 
when you're on the surface to set your
environment<00:01:21.650> settings<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.040> midnight<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:22.820> you

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
environment settings to midnight so you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.130 
environment settings to midnight so you
don't<00:01:23.060> see<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.330> Sun<00:01:23.510> we've<00:01:23.750> also<00:01:23.870> put<00:01:24.080> a

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
don't see the Sun we've also put a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.770 
don't see the Sun we've also put a
barrier<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.530> around<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.340> sim<00:01:25.550> so<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:26.630> don't

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
barrier up around the sim so you don't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.970 
barrier up around the sim so you don't
see<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> sea<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:27.380> anything<00:01:27.620> else<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:27.860> that

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
see the sea or anything else like that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.630 
see the sea or anything else like that
and<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:30.650> landscape<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:31.160> is<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:31.460> meant<00:01:31.580> to

and the landscape here is just meant to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.040 
and the landscape here is just meant to
generally<00:01:32.000> represent<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.510> moon<00:01:32.660> we<00:01:32.810> haven't

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
generally represent the moon we haven't

waiting<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.370> lunar<00:01:46.580> module<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.970> arrive

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
waiting for the lunar module to arrive

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.990 
waiting for the lunar module to arrive
and<00:01:47.450> here<00:01:48.230> it<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.380> descending<00:01:48.920> down<00:01:49.760> from

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and here it is descending down from

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.540 
and here it is descending down from
orbit

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.910 

we<00:01:55.360> built<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.960> new<00:01:56.200> model<00:01:56.440> of<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.590> lunar<00:01:56.680> module

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
we built a new model of the lunar module

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.770 
we built a new model of the lunar module
we<00:01:57.190> weren't<00:01:57.370> happy<00:01:57.610> with<00:01:57.670> any<00:01:57.850> ones<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.690> we

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
we weren't happy with any ones that we

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.170 
we weren't happy with any ones that we
could<00:01:58.900> find<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.650> second<00:01:59.890> life<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.280> also<00:02:00.760> we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
could find in second life and also we

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.310 
could find in second life and also we
also<00:02:01.270> wanted<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.690> able<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.870> do<00:02:01.960> things<00:02:02.110> like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
also wanted to be able to do things like

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.270 
also wanted to be able to do things like
this<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.650> fly<00:02:03.610> nicely<00:02:03.970> into<00:02:04.120> location<00:02:04.540> for<00:02:04.780> us

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

the<00:02:10.280> next<00:02:10.489> thing<00:02:10.580> we<00:02:10.670> want<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.880> do<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.150> actually

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the next thing we want to do is actually

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.570 
the next thing we want to do is actually
attach<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.080> head-up<00:02:12.530> display<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.489> going

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
attach the head-up display so just going

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.960 
attach the head-up display so just going
to<00:02:13.670> bring<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.510> my<00:02:14.720> inventory<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.970> as

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
to bring that out of my inventory and as

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.949 
to bring that out of my inventory and as
we<00:02:17.150> mentioned<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.510> pick<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> head-up

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
we mentioned you pick up the head-up

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.080 
we mentioned you pick up the head-up
display<00:02:18.319> at<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.440> arrivals<00:02:18.800> area<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.030> we

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
display at the arrivals area and what we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
display at the arrivals area and what we
have<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.480> variety<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.900> controls<00:02:21.319> in

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
have here is a variety of controls in

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
have here is a variety of controls in
order<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.730> control<00:02:23.300> various<00:02:23.480> aspects<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.959> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
order to control various aspects of the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
order to control various aspects of the
simulation<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.459> also<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> ability<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.300> view

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
simulation and also the ability to view

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.690 
simulation and also the ability to view
video<00:02:26.739> someone<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.950> now<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.250> position

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
video someone do now is just position

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.420 
video someone do now is just position
myself<00:02:28.849> just<00:02:29.239> by<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.420> ladder<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:30.560> about<00:02:31.250> my

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
myself just by the ladder like about my

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.130 
myself just by the ladder like about my
idea<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:34.269> one<00:02:35.269> of<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.420> questions<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.959> we

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
idea and one of the questions that we

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.780 
idea and one of the questions that we
actually<00:02:36.230> posed<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.920> blog<00:02:37.130> post<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.640> will

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
actually posed in the blog post is will

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.960 
actually posed in the blog post is will
it<00:02:37.819> be<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.480> 10-15<00:02:39.319> years<00:02:39.530> time<00:02:39.970> actually

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
it be like in 10-15 years time actually

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.610 
it be like in 10-15 years time actually
the<00:02:41.090> information<00:02:41.630> we<00:02:41.720> got<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.110> enable<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the information we got to enable the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.190 
the information we got to enable the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
down the steps instead of just having to

down the steps instead of just having to
graph<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.780> tutors<00:02:48.170> will<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.560> largely<00:02:48.860> very

I'm<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.629> cripple<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.140> glamour

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.740 

watching<00:03:22.670> video<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.060> animation<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.600> course

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
watching video and animation of course

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.300 
watching video and animation of course
is<00:03:23.900> all<00:03:24.020> very<00:03:24.200> well<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.830> all<00:03:24.920> just<00:03:25.100> create

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
is all very well but we all just create

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.520 
is all very well but we all just create
a<00:03:25.340> far<00:03:25.580> more<00:03:25.700> interactive<00:03:26.390> simulation<00:03:27.350> than

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
a far more interactive simulation than

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.320 
a far more interactive simulation than
that<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.489> we're<00:03:28.610> quite<00:03:28.700> lucky<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:29.150> found

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
that and we're quite lucky and we found

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.390 
that and we're quite lucky and we found
a<00:03:29.510> map<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.110> actually<00:03:30.350> showed<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> locations

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
a map that actually showed the locations

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.680 
a map that actually showed the locations
that<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.670> asteroids<00:03:31.940> have<00:03:32.060> walked<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
that the asteroids have walked on the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.449 
that the asteroids have walked on the
moon<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.709> what<00:03:33.800> were<00:03:33.890> able<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.100> do<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.370> actually

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
moon so what were able to do is actually

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.100 
moon so what were able to do is actually
overlay<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.180> map<00:03:35.450> with<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.690> one-for-one

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
overlay this map with a one-for-one

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.860 
overlay this map with a one-for-one
scale<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.739> Second<00:03:37.069> Life<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:38.180> enables<00:03:38.600> us<00:03:38.690> not

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
scale in Second Life this enables us not

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.180 
scale in Second Life this enables us not
only<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.050> see<00:03:39.290> where<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.620> lunar<00:03:39.800> module<00:03:39.920> is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
only to see where the lunar module is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.070 
only to see where the lunar module is
emerged<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.670> science<00:03:40.940> experiments<00:03:41.450> are<00:03:41.569> but

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
emerged the science experiments are but

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.750 
emerged the science experiments are but
also<00:03:42.230> see<00:03:42.440> exactly<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.010> paths<00:03:43.220> walk<00:03:43.519> by<00:03:43.700> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
also see exactly the paths walk by the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.880 
also see exactly the paths walk by the
astronauts<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.480> even<00:03:45.290> where<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> individual

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
astronauts and even where the individual

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.470 
astronauts and even where the individual
creatures<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.610> individual<00:03:47.060> rocks<00:03:47.209> are

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
creatures and the individual rocks are

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.840 
creatures and the individual rocks are
so<00:03:47.780> we've<00:03:47.900> used<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.200> information<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.980> model

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
so we've used that information to model

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.430 
so we've used that information to model
the<00:03:50.030> area<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.390> astronauts<00:03:50.930> actually<00:03:51.230> walked

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
the area the astronauts actually walked

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.860 
the area the astronauts actually walked
quite<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.800> high<00:03:52.040> degree<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.430> accuracy<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.720> as

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
quite a high degree of accuracy and as

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.090 
quite a high degree of accuracy and as
we<00:03:54.019> zoom<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.440> you'll<00:03:54.590> actually<00:03:54.680> be<00:03:54.860> able<00:03:54.920> to

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
we zoom in you'll actually be able to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.130 
we zoom in you'll actually be able to
see<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.400> markers<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:55.850> show<00:03:56.360> where<00:03:57.019> the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
see the markers that show where the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.170 
see the markers that show where the
rocks<00:03:57.319> are<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.650> where<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.890> craters<00:03:58.280> are<00:03:58.430> what

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
rocks are and where the craters are what

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.309 
rocks are and where the craters are what
we've<00:03:59.269> also<00:03:59.450> done<00:03:59.750> now<00:03:59.959> is<00:03:59.989> we've<00:04:00.080> also

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
we've also done now is we've also

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.809 
we've also done now is we've also
overlaid<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:00.920> positions<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.519> some<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
overlaid the positions of some of the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.670 
overlaid the positions of some of the
photography<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.540> was<00:04:02.660> taken<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.530> you'll

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
photography that was taken so you'll

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.630 
photography that was taken so you'll
actually<00:04:03.739> be<00:04:03.920> able<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.100> stand<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.610> the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
actually be able to stand in the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880 
actually be able to stand in the
positions<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.209> some<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.540> photos<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.709> as

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
positions of some of the photos and as

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.920 
positions of some of the photos and as
you<00:04:07.010> see<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> photos<00:04:07.760> at<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.239> same<00:04:08.510> time<00:04:08.750> is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
you see the photos at the same time is

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440 
you see the photos at the same time is
viewing<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.230> simulation<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:11.150> what<00:04:11.300> I'm<00:04:11.360> going

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
viewing the simulation so what I'm going

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.880 
viewing the simulation so what I'm going
to<00:04:11.510> do<00:04:11.660> now<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.019> take<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> walk<00:04:12.530> around<00:04:12.680> the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
to do now is take a walk around the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.640 
to do now is take a walk around the
lander<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.370> as<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.330> walk<00:04:14.510> up<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.989> one<00:04:15.350> of<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
lander and as I walk up to one of the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.469 
lander and as I walk up to one of the
camera<00:04:15.980> symbols<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:17.000> can<00:04:17.150> switch<00:04:17.329> these

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
camera symbols and you can switch these

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.789 
camera symbols and you can switch these
camera<00:04:17.840> symbols<00:04:18.140> on<00:04:18.229> and<00:04:18.380> off<00:04:18.470> through<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
camera symbols on and off through the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.990 
camera symbols on and off through the
hard<00:04:19.010> if<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.220> don't<00:04:19.400> actually<00:04:19.489> want<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:19.820> see

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
hard if you don't actually want to see

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.130 
hard if you don't actually want to see
them<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.140> hop<00:04:21.260> over<00:04:21.290> here<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.630> as<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.750> move

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
them so just hop over here and as I move

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.050 
them so just hop over here and as I move
on<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.620> one<00:04:24.950> of<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.100> camera<00:04:25.400> symbols<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:25.940> I

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
on to one of the camera symbols that I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.400 
on to one of the camera symbols that I
immediately<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> photograph<00:04:27.289> that

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
immediately get to the photograph that

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.469 
immediately get to the photograph that
was<00:04:27.470> taken<00:04:27.590> from<00:04:27.950> that<00:04:28.130> point<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:29.210> camera

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
was taken from that point and the camera

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.210 
was taken from that point and the camera
itself<00:04:29.570> gives<00:04:29.990> me<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.200> direction<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.770> face<00:04:30.979> us

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
itself gives me the direction to face us

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.029 
itself gives me the direction to face us
actually<00:04:31.430> see<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.360> same<00:04:32.600> shot<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.169> the

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
actually see the same shot as the

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.300 
actually see the same shot as the
astronauts<00:04:34.460> actually<00:04:34.820> took<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:36.190> you'll<00:04:37.190> also

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
astronauts actually took and you'll also

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.710 
astronauts actually took and you'll also
see<00:04:37.610> on<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.850> head-up<00:04:38.000> display<00:04:38.390> there<00:04:38.600> you

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
see on the head-up display there you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.440 
see on the head-up display there you
also<00:04:38.930> get<00:04:39.050> some<00:04:39.260> introductory<00:04:39.620> text<00:04:40.100> as<00:04:40.220> well

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
also get some introductory text as well

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.700 
also get some introductory text as well
about<00:04:41.450> what<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.720> photos<00:04:41.990> about<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.410> me<00:04:42.530> even

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
about what the photos about to me even

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.200 
about what the photos about to me even
show<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.010> elapsed<00:04:43.250> time<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.789> mission<00:04:43.910> as

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
show the elapsed time for the mission as

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.980 
show the elapsed time for the mission as
well<00:04:46.060> here<00:04:47.060> we<00:04:47.150> are<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.419> solar<00:04:47.960> wind

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
well here we are the solar wind

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.810 
well here we are the solar wind
experiment<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.890> if<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.250> actually<00:04:49.490> touch<00:04:49.789> the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
experiment and if we actually touch the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.270 
experiment and if we actually touch the
experiment<00:04:50.450> then<00:04:51.229> again<00:04:51.860> we<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.250> a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
experiment then again we get a

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.590 
experiment then again we get a
photograph<00:04:52.520> experiments<00:04:53.240> taken<00:04:53.450> by<00:04:53.539> the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
photograph experiments taken by the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.090 
photograph experiments taken by the
astral<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.140> we<00:04:54.229> get<00:04:54.350> some<00:04:54.560> more<00:04:54.710> descriptive

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
astral so we get some more descriptive

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.890 
astral so we get some more descriptive
text<00:04:55.580> but<00:04:56.300> this<00:04:56.390> time<00:04:56.479> we<00:04:56.600> also<00:04:56.720> got<00:04:56.870> a

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
text but this time we also got a

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.380 
text but this time we also got a
hyperlink<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:58.039> we<00:04:58.220> can<00:04:58.400> touch<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:58.970> hyperlink

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
hyperlink and we can touch the hyperlink

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.810 
hyperlink and we can touch the hyperlink
and<00:04:59.600> then<00:05:00.169> call<00:05:00.410> up<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.680> webpage<00:05:00.979> I've<00:05:01.610> actually

and then call up a webpage I've actually

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.000 
and then call up a webpage I've actually
describes<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.600> particular<00:05:02.870> experiment<00:05:03.350> in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
describes that particular experiment in

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.940 
describes that particular experiment in
a<00:05:04.190> bit<00:05:04.340> more<00:05:04.460> detail

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950

and again a photograph they're shown

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.900 
and again a photograph they're shown
when<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.200> astronauts<00:05:21.470> buy<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.220> again<00:05:22.520> we

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
when the astronauts buy it and again we

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.810 
when the astronauts buy it and again we
can<00:05:23.120> touch<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.720> hyperlink<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.680> read<00:05:25.640> more

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
can touch the hyperlink and read more

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:33.880 
can touch the hyperlink and read more
information<00:05:26.240> about<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.600> on<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.380> web

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.200 

and<00:05:34.890> now<00:05:35.490> I'm<00:05:35.550> actually<00:05:35.670> going<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:35.970> follow

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
and now I'm actually going to follow

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.180 
and now I'm actually going to follow
Armstrong's<00:05:36.930> their<00:05:37.320> path<00:05:37.530> out<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.950> one<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.130> the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
Armstrong's their path out to one of the

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.690 
Armstrong's their path out to one of the
panorama<00:05:38.550> locations<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:43.100> as<00:05:44.100> we<00:05:44.220> move<00:05:44.430> up<00:05:44.580> to

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
panorama locations and as we move up to

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.910 
panorama locations and as we move up to
the<00:05:44.730> panorama<00:05:45.150> location<00:05:45.690> again<00:05:46.530> we<00:05:46.710> get<00:05:46.830> the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
the panorama location again we get the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.110 
the panorama location again we get the
photograph<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.370> was<00:05:47.430> taken<00:05:47.520> from<00:05:47.850> there

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
photograph that was taken from there

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.920 
photograph that was taken from there
looking<00:05:48.450> back<00:05:48.630> towards<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.140> lunar<00:05:49.710> module

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
looking back towards the lunar module

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.840 
looking back towards the lunar module
and<00:05:51.930> we<00:05:52.830> can<00:05:52.920> also<00:05:53.040> actually<00:05:53.220> access<00:05:53.820> the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
and we can also actually access the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.360 
and we can also actually access the
panorama<00:05:54.330> itself<00:05:54.690> we<00:05:54.840> just<00:05:55.020> touch<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.440> small

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
panorama itself we just touch the small

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.560 
panorama itself we just touch the small
ghosted<00:05:56.760> button<00:05:57.000> there<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:59.120> up<00:06:00.120> comes<00:06:00.450> the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
ghosted button there and up comes the

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.390 
ghosted button there and up comes the
panorama<00:06:00.990> that<00:06:01.440> was<00:06:01.530> taken<00:06:01.830> by<00:06:01.950> Armstrong<00:06:02.640> and

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
panorama that was taken by Armstrong and

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.600 
panorama that was taken by Armstrong and
tied<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.520> panorama<00:06:05.940> again<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:07.340> now<00:06:08.340> we<00:06:08.400> can

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
tied the panorama again and now we can

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.510 
tied the panorama again and now we can
actually<00:06:08.730> enjoy<00:06:08.940> our<00:06:09.210> simulated<00:06:09.630> panorama

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
actually enjoy our simulated panorama

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.350 
actually enjoy our simulated panorama
first<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.640> all<00:06:11.700> we'll<00:06:11.850> all<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.060> overlaid

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
first of all we'll all the overlaid

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.220 
first of all we'll all the overlaid
information<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:14.390> then<00:06:15.390> it's<00:06:15.900> more<00:06:16.050> natural

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
information and then it's more natural

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:28.940 
information and then it's more natural
state

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.430 

now<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.250> EPA's<00:06:30.120> almost<00:06:30.450> over<00:06:30.630> so<00:06:31.080> we're<00:06:31.320> going

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
now the EPA's almost over so we're going

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.140 
now the EPA's almost over so we're going
to<00:06:31.530> bunny<00:06:31.800> hop<00:06:31.950> away<00:06:32.220> back<00:06:32.490> towards<00:06:32.850> the<00:06:32.910> lunar

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
to bunny hop away back towards the lunar

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.790 
to bunny hop away back towards the lunar
module

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.649 

and<00:06:36.889> now<00:06:37.849> we're<00:06:37.970> going<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.120> do<00:06:38.270> something<00:06:38.569> that

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
and now we're going to do something that

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.330 
and now we're going to do something that
armstrong<00:06:39.139> and<00:06:39.319> aldrin<00:06:39.379> couldn't<00:06:39.860> do<00:06:39.979> which

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
armstrong and aldrin couldn't do which

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.710 
armstrong and aldrin couldn't do which
is<00:06:40.370> actually<00:06:40.610> going<00:06:40.819> to<00:06:40.909> watch<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.389> ascent

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
is actually going to watch the ascent

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.080 
is actually going to watch the ascent
stage<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:42.470> the<00:06:42.560> lunar<00:06:42.770> module<00:06:42.860> head<00:06:43.759> back<00:06:43.940> up

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
stage of the lunar module head back up

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:53.140 
stage of the lunar module head back up
into<00:06:44.289> moon's<00:06:45.289> orbit

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:07:08.650 

you

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.520 

hopefully<00:07:09.660> this<00:07:09.780> video<00:07:09.990> is<00:07:10.080> giving<00:07:10.259> you<00:07:10.320> some

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
hopefully this video is giving you some

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.320 
hopefully this video is giving you some
idea<00:07:10.800> the<00:07:10.919> sort<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.490> simulation<00:07:11.970> that<00:07:12.090> we<00:07:12.180> can

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
idea the sort of simulation that we can

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.510 
idea the sort of simulation that we can
achieve<00:07:12.419> in<00:07:12.840> second<00:07:13.410> life<00:07:13.500> we've<00:07:14.280> been<00:07:14.370> able

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
achieve in second life we've been able

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.629 
achieve in second life we've been able
to<00:07:14.610> mix<00:07:14.790> the<00:07:14.970> 2d<00:07:15.360> and<00:07:15.600> 3d<00:07:15.830> audio<00:07:16.830> and<00:07:17.340> video

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 
to mix the 2d and 3d audio and video

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:19.070 
to mix the 2d and 3d audio and video
resources<00:07:18.180> so<00:07:18.539> it's<00:07:18.660> create<00:07:18.870> a<00:07:18.900> quite

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
resources so it's create a quite

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.779 
resources so it's create a quite
immersive<00:07:19.650> experience<00:07:20.190> of<00:07:20.430> what<00:07:20.639> it<00:07:20.729> would

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:20.789 
immersive experience of what it would

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.129 
immersive experience of what it would
