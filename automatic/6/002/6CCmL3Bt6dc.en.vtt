it's<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.460> guy<00:00:17.610> I<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.910> designed<00:00:18.330> many

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
it's a guy I have designed many

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.320 
it's a guy I have designed many
televisions<00:00:19.290> and<00:00:19.650> every<00:00:20.400> time<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> design<00:00:21.090> one

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
televisions and every time I design one

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.740 
televisions and every time I design one
I<00:00:21.560> always<00:00:22.560> wonder<00:00:22.980> why<00:00:23.910> should<00:00:24.120> televisions

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I always wonder why should televisions

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.440 
I always wonder why should televisions
be<00:00:24.960> flat<00:00:25.370> the<00:00:26.370> world<00:00:26.580> we're<00:00:26.820> living<00:00:26.850> in<00:00:27.270> isn't

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
be flat the world we're living in isn't

be flat the world we're living in isn't
flat<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.640> elegant<00:00:30.060> curves<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> circles

found in architecture and other various

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.850 
found in architecture and other various
objects<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.680> inspired<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> long<00:00:36.090> time

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
objects have inspired me for a long time

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.890 
objects have inspired me for a long time
so<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.160> wanted<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> give<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> new<00:00:39.330> life<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
so I wanted to give a new life to the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.869 
so I wanted to give a new life to the
television<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.830> these<00:00:40.980> beautiful<00:00:41.580> shapes

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

and curved OLED technology it is always

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
and curved OLED technology it is always
exciting<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.170> create<00:00:46.470> something<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.160> has

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
exciting to create something which has

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.790 
exciting to create something which has
never<00:00:47.580> existed<00:00:47.730> before

what<00:00:50.790> bothered<00:00:51.270> me<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.600> most<00:00:51.629> during<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
what bothered me the most during this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.000 
what bothered me the most during this
development<00:00:53.219> most<00:00:53.820> people's<00:00:54.300> attitudes<00:00:55.010> they

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
development most people's attitudes they

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
development most people's attitudes they
were<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.370> even<00:00:56.399> trying<00:00:56.970> due<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> their<00:00:57.780> belief

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
were not even trying due to their belief

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
were not even trying due to their belief
that<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.829> impossible<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.579> bend<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> TV

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that it was impossible to bend a TV

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:12.990 
that it was impossible to bend a TV
panel

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.180 

we<00:01:14.000> did<00:01:14.270> succeed<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:14.990> bending<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.470> TV<00:01:15.800> panel

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
we did succeed in bending the TV panel

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.060 
we did succeed in bending the TV panel
but<00:01:16.820> there<00:01:17.090> was<00:01:17.270> another<00:01:17.510> difficulty<00:01:18.230> how<00:01:18.860> can

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
but there was another difficulty how can

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.400 
but there was another difficulty how can
we<00:01:19.190> make<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:19.550> stand<00:01:19.790> upright<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:21.140> key<00:01:21.290> to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
we make it stand upright the key to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.350 
we make it stand upright the key to
solving<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:21.920> problem<00:01:21.980> was<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.850> find<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
solving this problem was to find the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.450 
solving this problem was to find the
exact<00:01:23.810> conduction<00:01:24.470> angle<00:01:24.620> then<00:01:25.010> level<00:01:25.340> of

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
exact conduction angle then level of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.610 
exact conduction angle then level of
conductivity<00:01:26.090> for<00:01:26.600> our<00:01:26.750> first<00:01:27.020> curved<00:01:27.410> OLED

powerful impact as an IMAX screen we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
powerful impact as an IMAX screen we
applied<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> crystalline<00:01:51.030> stand<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> the
