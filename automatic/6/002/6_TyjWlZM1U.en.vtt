00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.270
 hello to everyone hi everyone then 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.840
 attention third tutorial and that she kills 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 early how to successfully fish 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.279
 fish to the spoon so we'll get 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.480
 hand over to our spot tutor then the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.830
 spoon so in fact it's I tried 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.839
 full of technique I tried to follow 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.240
 directions straight slowly 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.080
 middle stuff and company I've never 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.100
 nothing succeeded so 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.079
 I give up this technique and I 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.670
 found a technique cap to larache and I 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.530
 will try to explain it to you and you 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.870
 go see it's fantastic it works 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.640
 almost every time 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.039
 just have to understand the thing then 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.940
 in fact I'm going to the trick actually it's the 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:56.300
 purpose is to make a mill 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.680
 slow speed 1 or 2 fr sorry do 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.330
 breaks and and pats 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.100
 regular shoeing when not 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.590
 when we manage to put the step to mid 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.619
 height in the water so this part 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.840
 then to show the technique we mouline 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.540
 and while leaving reel and wet 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.650
 while leaving so we mill in 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.150
 pressing the left click and while 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 leaving reel we give small to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.610
 blow when we get to put theirs 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.960
 halfway up so I repeat the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 technique we run on the mill with the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.090
 little left and we make small 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.460
 breaks and when we get to put the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.950
 not halfway up the water we give 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.230
 small shots of irregular shoeing so 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.160
 that's the theory 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.580
 now the practice 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.470
 so I'm going to throw the ball so 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 always technical reeds it works 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 not bad for predators 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.680
 I run I tell myself I let down 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.910
 a little bit and there I'm milling and here I have 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.560
 to go back up with the speeds for 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.590
 put the fish at half height and a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.090
 give a little bit I 'm back to mid 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.250
 height 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.730
 I give a little bit I take a break 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.770
 I never come back 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.300
 milling go half height never done 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.820
 Sail evil tried to make page 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.260
 a fish and that's halfway to small 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.980
 blow it works every time guys 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.760
 finally just did not mess me up there is the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.620
 mont gaillard to these technical guarantees 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.430
 like that we must not try to go 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.440
 very gently to follow the advice the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.440
 little tips that are marked to 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.090
 right it never works almost go to 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.590
 larache a bit like real actually 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.519
 must really do everything like 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.810
 andré it works impeccable alétois angers 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.830
 reel faster because it 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.950
 disappears to elbow to the attention I go up 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.630
 the tension to the so that it remains well 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.269
 so well manage his tension is 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 compelled to reel you saw the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.930
 satire and the fish if we leave too much 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 of slack he gets off too much 2000 that's 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.870
 death not soft enough it's dead too 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.870
 we follow the beast as an acquired opt 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.510
 went to war then we see them 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.800
 well in the distance go, that's good 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:28.010
 hachey big mouth watch go 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.010
 kiss a direct blow we launch 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.550
 ok we run well I should have said 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.310
 so we throw far away points in 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.320
 the hérault back to this part on 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.450
 do not cling to the tree 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.310
 leaded or touches the ground and we start 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.110
 in mouly we try to go back to the level 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.020
 by increasing the speed already has some 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.350
 little colors go I put back on the ground 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.390
 I am moulin 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.350
 I put the best and that's it 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.390
 fucking but it works every time end 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.940
 I meant damn flute it works to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:16.560
 every time 100% guaranteed tutorial of the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.860
 shark z the peach spoon 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.940
 do not follow the advice to the nana 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:27.570
 na na na the baribans the saligaud he 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:32.220
 is up to the bankruptcy judge to lose and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.670
 his tomorrow to the years my earns well 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.510
 keep the wire tight I'm not too 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.100
 well done and here is his second name 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.370
 that allah in less than five minutes one of 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.380
 fish the spoon I do not know what 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.030
 I can 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.580
 explain others go we made a 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.110
 last time for those who are in the 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:58.430
 background of the room and that we can listen 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:01.220
 so we start as far as we can 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.920
 drop the thing on the ground and in 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.940
 mill story to make them go up 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 third gear there they increase and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:21.640
 there kilos middle I give small 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:21.640
 shots took a break to go go 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:33.920
 it's missed it maybe not there is 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.550
 no more than ten thousand children fish 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.430
 in revival I have decoyed too much 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.870
 of eagerness to the east he is suddenly what 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.240
 was not lucky to say it I 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.230
 start again in that did not work either 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.150
 every time actually that sarah and 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.640
 simulation is good to have the 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.080
 control but there is also this need 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.280
 that there is a small random side 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.880
 does not stop playing fun increases 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.100
 speed like the middle fish 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.200
 little break and that's it left for 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.140
 a lap 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.480
 these are the guys you go guaranteed 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.280
 well there you lose you not kept from 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.460
 the attention for not that the fish 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.460
 go 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.380
 this is tac tac tac tac 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:31.400
 here you go go smart me too I 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.860
 am madam lady and that's it 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.210
 So that was listening to it, it's not 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.850
 big fish because I used 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.930
 a basic min 7 g I would have taken 1.9 g 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.580
 there would be bigger fish 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.650
 but the technique is this one 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.800
 walk all the time good luck them 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.800
 guys
