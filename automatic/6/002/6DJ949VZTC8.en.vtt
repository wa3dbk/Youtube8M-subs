00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
so yeah and then max attack power rock

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.099 
so yeah and then max attack power rock
slide<00:02:15.700> from<00:02:15.879> Toros<00:02:16.500> nothing<00:02:17.500> ever<00:02:17.680> lives<00:02:19.109> this

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
slide from Toros nothing ever lives this

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.599 
slide from Toros nothing ever lives this
is<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.379> most<00:02:20.500> epic<00:02:20.709> strategy<00:02:21.280> you'll<00:02:21.459> ever

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
is the most epic strategy you'll ever

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.910 
is the most epic strategy you'll ever
see<00:02:21.939> I've<00:02:22.659> never<00:02:22.900> seen<00:02:23.109> anybody<00:02:23.409> use<00:02:23.739> this

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
see I've never seen anybody use this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.550 
see I've never seen anybody use this
before<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:25.659> best<00:02:25.840> part<00:02:26.019> is<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.230> came<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.530> with

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
before the best part is I came up with

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.699 
before the best part is I came up with
it<00:02:26.739> all<00:02:26.859> by<00:02:26.920> myself<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:29.200> kind<00:02:29.439> of<00:02:29.500> funny

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
it all by myself and it's kind of funny

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.410 
it all by myself and it's kind of funny
because<00:02:29.829> of<00:02:30.069> me<00:02:30.219> I've<00:02:30.519> seen<00:02:30.760> no<00:02:30.969> one<00:02:31.000> try<00:02:31.359> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
because of me I've seen no one try to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.379 
because of me I've seen no one try to
copy<00:02:31.719> it<00:02:31.989> either<00:02:32.430> which<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.579> was<00:02:33.730> actually<00:02:34.030> kind

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
copy it either which I was actually kind

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.420 
copy it either which I was actually kind
of<00:02:34.420> expecting

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
of expecting

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.750 
of expecting
so<00:02:37.120> yeah<00:02:37.750> rockslide<00:02:38.620> totally<00:02:39.069> destroyed<00:02:39.489> them

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so yeah rockslide totally destroyed them

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.699 
so yeah rockslide totally destroyed them
and<00:02:39.969> now<00:02:40.269> it's<00:02:40.510> pretty<00:02:40.719> much<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.409> matter

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
and now it's pretty much just a matter

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.860 
and now it's pretty much just a matter
whether<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.549> not<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.879> hit<00:02:43.269> both<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.569> them

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
whether or not I can hit both of them

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.990 
whether or not I can hit both of them
although<00:02:44.530> rockslide<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.310> pretty<00:02:45.670> accurate

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
although rockslide is pretty accurate

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.940 
although rockslide is pretty accurate
there<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.019> always<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.439> chance<00:02:47.469> that<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.920> could

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there is always the chance that it could

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.240 
there is always the chance that it could
miss<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.109> since<00:02:50.109> they<00:02:50.319> now<00:02:50.469> know<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.769> Toros

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
miss and since they now know that Toros

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.649 
miss and since they now know that Toros
has<00:02:51.430> his<00:02:51.579> attacked<00:02:51.909> max<00:02:52.239> he's<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:52.629> a

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
has his attacked max he's now a

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.959 
has his attacked max he's now a
wonderful<00:02:53.469> target<00:02:53.889> so<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.519> know<00:02:54.670> they're<00:02:54.849> not

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:54.969 
wonderful target so I know they're not

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.550 
wonderful target so I know they're not
going<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.209> going<00:02:55.389> for<00:02:55.540> Vigoroth<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.349> then<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
going to be going for Vigoroth so then I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.879 
going to be going for Vigoroth so then I
just<00:02:56.680> decided<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.310> go<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.639> pure<00:02:58.019> free<00:02:59.019> focus

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
just decided to go for a pure free focus

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.550 
just decided to go for a pure free focus
energy<00:03:00.099> just<00:03:00.609> to<00:03:00.730> charge<00:03:01.269> up<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.870> Toros

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
energy just to charge up if Toros

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.890 
energy just to charge up if Toros
doesn't<00:03:02.889> survive<00:03:03.129> this<00:03:03.400> turn<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:04.719> i<00:03:04.810> were

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
doesn't survive this turn like if i were

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.509 
doesn't survive this turn like if i were
to<00:03:05.019> miss<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.409> they'd<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.650> off<00:03:05.799> an<00:03:05.980> attack<00:03:06.280> and

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
to miss and they'd get off an attack and

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.649 
to miss and they'd get off an attack and
stuff<00:03:06.730> but<00:03:07.389> i<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.719> lucky<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.849> don't<00:03:10.359> miss

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
stuff but i get lucky and I don't miss

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.300 
stuff but i get lucky and I don't miss
and<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.049> kill<00:03:11.260> them<00:03:11.409> both<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.730> yeah<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.379> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
and I kill them both so yeah this is the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.679 
and I kill them both so yeah this is the
best<00:03:15.519> strategy<00:03:15.669> I've<00:03:16.090> ever<00:03:16.299> come<00:03:16.510> up<00:03:16.659> with

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
best strategy I've ever come up with

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.540 
best strategy I've ever come up with
it's<00:03:17.290> nothing<00:03:17.799> has<00:03:18.069> ever<00:03:18.250> out<00:03:18.489> done<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.909> yet

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
it's nothing has ever out done this yet

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's nothing has ever out done this yet
so<00:03:21.120> yeah<00:03:21.360> there's<00:03:22.350> my<00:03:23.010> flagship<00:03:23.610> team<00:03:23.910> /

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
so yeah there's my flagship team /

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.520 
so yeah there's my flagship team /
strategy<00:03:25.050> right<00:03:25.680> there<00:03:25.730> anger<00:03:26.730> point<00:03:27.000> tauros

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
strategy right there anger point tauros

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.300 
strategy right there anger point tauros
I've<00:03:28.530> only<00:03:28.770> got<00:03:28.980> two<00:03:29.160> other<00:03:29.340> videos<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.510> this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I've only got two other videos with this

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.680 
I've only got two other videos with this
strategy<00:03:32.310> sweeping<00:03:32.760> although<00:03:33.180> this<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
strategy sweeping although this is the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
strategy sweeping although this is the
third<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.320> refine<00:03:34.740> managed<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> get<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
third one and I refine managed to get a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.370 
third one and I refine managed to get a
second<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> same<00:03:36.420> day<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.200> that's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
second one in the same day so that's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.120 
second one in the same day so that's
awesome<00:03:37.800> game<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.910> yeah<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.990> destroyed<00:03:40.890> them

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
awesome game so yeah I destroyed them

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.690 
awesome game so yeah I destroyed them
and<00:03:41.460> they<00:03:41.640> never<00:03:42.000> had<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> chance<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:44.160> yeah<00:03:44.490> I'll
