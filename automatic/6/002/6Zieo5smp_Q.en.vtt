00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 today we produce about 150 kilos of kitchen and garden waste by 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.589
 inhabitant and per year 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.749
 composting reduces waste at the source 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.629
 a family that counts can avoid throwing more than a third of 

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:22.629
 death of his sentence not bad no 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.030
 take an example of a petanque gentleman I never want to see his prices again 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140
 for this green waste and greatly reduced the volume of its trash 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.719
 you can compost almost all the waste 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.319
 of the created kitchen and garden all that is that I am happy to 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:38.050
 vegetables 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 but also take part in all the fruit crops 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.830
 the cheese titles et cetera virtually all and compute what 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.870
 is hardly seen in reality these are the big bones 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 because they are too difficult to break down 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.810
 and then the shells 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.820
 do you know that kitchen waste is made up with 90% of them 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 then if you put them the candle it will be cremated which is very expensive 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.570
 so much to turn them into compost 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 indeed while others were making his choice 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.490
 so we can obviously put in his compost the eggshells a 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.680
 but also percent 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.580
 the coffee filter with the coffee grounds of course it is very rich 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 the kraft paper 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.490
 possibly newsprint 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.960
 small towels 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.000
 in paper 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.770
 we can of course also waste garden 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.650
 then all the weeds if they are not to hate them the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.300
 garden waste the old leek leaves you can put 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.090
 also a little lawn mowing well dry the ideal it would be 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.060
 to use 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.490
 for mulching 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.420
 you can also highlight in autumn and winter and at the beginning of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.090
 spring some dead leaves that will come 1 mop up the excess water 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.410
 lack of this kitchen waste 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.899
 it's important to help 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.880
 at the city level bulky waste such as small branches 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.650
 the twigs 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.219
 dead leaves also 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.429
 but the best way to value all green waste 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.759
 well once they are crushed cd is used in bankruptcy 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 but what is important is to mix well during each contribution to 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.099
 to mix kitchen waste that is wet with waste a 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.430
 little more and that such as dead leaves if you do not have any 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.249
 defecate cat well you can use another who such as the arm this compost 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.359
 we live alone 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.329
 in the composter to take composting views below we shake 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.819
 all this is what allows to mix all the waste well and if you 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.510
 do not have this tool here you can also use a little claw which 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.109
 allows 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.400
 a superficial mixture the decomposition is always done by 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.229
 living beings first of all bacteria and fungi 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.329
 that we do not see with the naked eye and very quickly because they started to 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.689
 do the work intervene larger bodies the one that the 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.479
 little red glasses of manure that we saw the little white dots these are 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.819
 collembola also mites fly larvae midges 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.539
 for all this world to develop they need a lot 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.879
 of oxygen, hence the importance of brewing regularly during each intake 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.969
 to bring oxygen to the compounds and they also need water 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.349
 enough not too much if you put kitchen waste rates because at 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.730
 too early so behind riviera bad smells a lot of nose 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.539
 gnat it would be unpleasant and so every time you put some 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.679
 kitchen waste must be added materials arm 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.889
 compensate for excess moisture from kitchen waste and bring to a 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 food balance for microorganisms 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.299
 after 6 hours to 8 months 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.870
 if you have much better players of every intake you get a compost 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.280
 ripe 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.220
 that you will be able to use in your garden to what do we recognize that 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 the compost is ripe and good just because it takes a nice 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.349
 structure no longer recognizes the original waste 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.779
 and then we do not see anymore the small animals that have compounds 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.949
 will be possible that it is for use in the garden 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.949
 I will show you how we do 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.439
 thanks to your free compost you did during your health 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.439
 it's a lot less maintenance 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.569
 today it's silly to send a reassuring sign the water contained in our 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:46.699
 waste 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.919
 unlike big house porto 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.330
 everyone can compost 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.370
 the smictom subsidizes the purchase of composters proposed to reduce your 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.819
 so invoice your waste 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
 we think it's useful we think it's easy 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.560
 Yes
