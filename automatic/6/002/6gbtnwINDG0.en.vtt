obviously lots of you guys kind of said
that<00:00:20.279> maybe<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.060> shouldn't<00:00:21.390> assign<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that maybe I shouldn't assign the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
that maybe I shouldn't assign the
increase<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> left<00:00:22.289> back<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
increase the left back but I just

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.560 
increase the left back but I just
thought<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.000> worth<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.390> kind<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
thought that it was worth the kind of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.700 
thought that it was worth the kind of
pace<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> had<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> thought<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.590> worth

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
pace that you had I thought it's worth

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
pace that you had I thought it's worth
it<00:00:25.980> regardless<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.640> playing<00:00:27.000> him<00:00:27.150> him<00:00:27.269> sent<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it regardless if playing him him sent it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.550 
it regardless if playing him him sent it
back<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> position

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
back is out of position

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
back is out of position
I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.980> his<00:00:29.070> pace<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.429> worried<00:00:29.609> because

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I think his pace was worried because

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.370 
I think his pace was worried because
because<00:00:30.210> he<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> keep<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.779> any<00:00:31.019> single

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because he we have to keep up any single

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
because he we have to keep up any single

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
good header IVA and I could say that it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.960 
good header IVA and I could say that it
was<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.440> those<00:02:15.530> games<00:02:15.830> where<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.819> we

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
was one of those games where like we

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.880 
was one of those games where like we
deserve<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.360> win<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.350> don't<00:02:18.380> really<00:02:18.770> think

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
deserve to win but I don't really think

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.140 
deserve to win but I don't really think
the<00:02:19.040> shots<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:19.430> provided<00:02:19.760> were

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the shots that we provided were

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.730 
the shots that we provided were
necessarily<00:02:20.690> good<00:02:20.930> enough<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> go<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.470> anyway

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
necessarily good enough to go in anyway

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.140 
necessarily good enough to go in anyway
and<00:02:21.980> they<00:02:22.160> had<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.310> good<00:02:22.459> enough<00:02:22.610> goalkeeper<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
and they had a good enough goalkeeper to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.180 
and they had a good enough goalkeeper to
save<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> shots<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.870> threw<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.230> him<00:02:24.290> so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
save the shots that we threw at him so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.680 
save the shots that we threw at him so
currently<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.670> can't<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.270> complain<00:02:26.510> really

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
to me that I should have done that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150

and<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.610> didn't<00:02:31.820> really<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.060> about<00:02:32.150> that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
and I didn't really think about that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.080 
and I didn't really think about that
because<00:02:33.200> crack<00:02:33.740> know<00:02:33.950> inspires<00:02:34.370> yes<00:02:34.790> they're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
because crack know inspires yes they're

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.030 
because crack know inspires yes they're
good<00:02:35.300> goalkeepers<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:35.900> potential<00:02:36.470> but

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
good goalkeepers with potential but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.410 
good goalkeepers with potential but
they're<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.280> experienced<00:02:37.790> goalkeepers<00:02:38.300> have

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
they're not experienced goalkeepers have

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.760 
they're not experienced goalkeepers have
a<00:02:38.540> higher<00:02:38.780> overall<00:02:39.140> rating<00:02:39.470> that's<00:02:39.620> what<00:02:39.709> we

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
a higher overall rating that's what we

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.229 
a higher overall rating that's what we
need<00:02:39.920> right<00:02:40.070> now<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.610> think<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.060> only

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
need right now because I think the only

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.430 
need right now because I think the only
comfort<00:02:41.450> against<00:02:41.600> bigger<00:02:41.780> teams<00:02:42.050> we're<00:02:42.290> going

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
comfort against bigger teams we're going

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.170 
comfort against bigger teams we're going
to<00:02:42.500> struggle<00:02:42.860> because<00:02:43.580> they<00:02:43.610> could<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:44.000> two

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
to struggle because they could have two

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.550 
to struggle because they could have two
shots<00:02:44.390> in<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.600> score<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.110> could<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.350> 20

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
shots in the score and I could have 20

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.250 
shots in the score and I could have 20
shots<00:02:45.770> on<00:02:45.950> these<00:02:46.070> goal<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.390> we'll<00:02:48.020> see<00:02:48.140> how

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
shots on these goal one so we'll see how

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.810 
shots on these goal one so we'll see how
it<00:02:48.410> goes<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.590> might<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.160> shot<00:02:49.190> slice<00:02:49.550> one<00:02:49.730> on

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.900 
Spurs as I've seen from looking I've
been<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> team<00:03:44.959> they've<00:03:45.170> been<00:03:45.290> very<00:03:45.590> good<00:03:45.980> on

and<00:04:50.599> I<00:04:50.659> brought<00:04:50.810> us<00:04:50.930> back<00:04:51.080> into<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:51.409> game<00:04:51.440> and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
and I brought us back into the game and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.450 
and I brought us back into the game and
I<00:04:51.740> definitely<00:04:51.860> thought<00:04:52.099> I<00:04:52.159> could<00:04:52.310> have<00:04:52.400> a

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
I definitely thought I could have a

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.350 
I definitely thought I could have a
chance<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.789> winning<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.060> game<00:04:53.210> especially

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
chance of winning this game especially

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.939 
chance of winning this game especially
with<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.840> fact<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.259> created<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.740> many

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
with the fact that I created so many

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.409 
with the fact that I created so many
chances<00:04:55.129> in<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.460> game<00:04:55.639> but<00:04:55.819> Loras<00:04:56.270> just

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
chances in this game but Loras just

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.399 
chances in this game but Loras just
keeping<00:04:56.629> me<00:04:56.690> out<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:56.930> think<00:04:57.020> maybe<00:04:57.319> I

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
keeping me out so I think maybe I

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.110 
keeping me out so I think maybe I
probably<00:04:57.889> did<00:04:58.069> a<00:04:58.099> lot<00:04:58.250> maybe<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.520> could<00:04:58.759> pick<00:04:59.060> up

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
probably did a lot maybe I could pick up

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.430 
probably did a lot maybe I could pick up
some<00:04:59.180> more<00:04:59.360> goals<00:04:59.599> but<00:05:00.139> straightaway

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
got Robinho in the bench and if you look

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.480 
got Robinho in the bench and if you look
at<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.800> rest<00:05:57.949> of<00:05:57.979> the<00:05:58.069> team<00:05:58.219> it's<00:05:58.340> very

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
at the rest of the team it's very

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.860 
at the rest of the team it's very
different<00:05:58.759> teams<00:05:59.120> what<00:05:59.300> they<00:05:59.389> actually<00:05:59.569> have

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
different teams what they actually have

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.300 
different teams what they actually have
in<00:06:00.020> real<00:06:00.229> life<00:06:00.409> it's<00:06:00.590> coming<00:06:00.830> in<00:06:00.919> silence

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
in real life it's coming in silence

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.649 
in real life it's coming in silence
maybe<00:06:01.430> I'm<00:06:01.580> guessing<00:06:01.880> they've<00:06:01.969> made<00:06:02.120> quite<00:06:02.389> a

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
maybe I'm guessing they've made quite a

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.930 
maybe I'm guessing they've made quite a
lot<00:06:02.960> of<00:06:03.169> signings<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:04.069> they<00:06:04.159> have<00:06:04.310> Lukaku<00:06:04.759> out

front as their main man straight away
from<00:06:07.370> kickoff<00:06:07.669> they<00:06:08.029> punished<00:06:08.300> me<00:06:08.330> literally

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
from kickoff they punished me literally

the car who's there to put that away in

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.890

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
and this this was a lead on the toughest

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
and again first took a minute but he's

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.730

sitting there thinking this could be an
absolute<00:06:26.690> demolishing<00:06:27.650> because<00:06:28.039> at<00:06:28.279> least

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
absolute demolishing because at least
