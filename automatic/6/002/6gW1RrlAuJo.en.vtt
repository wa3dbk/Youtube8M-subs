00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
you'll see the sides of the heat press I

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.180 
you'll see the sides of the heat press I
almost<00:01:30.940> have<00:01:31.209> steam<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:32.590> very<00:01:32.800> very

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
almost have steam so it's very very

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.529 
almost have steam so it's very very
important<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:33.759> do<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> pre<00:01:34.149> press<00:01:34.360> any

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
important that we do the pre press any

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.059 
important that we do the pre press any
shrinking<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.140> gonna<00:01:35.289> happen<00:01:35.470> right<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:35.800> and

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
shrinking is gonna happen right now and

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.600 
shrinking is gonna happen right now and
it's<00:01:36.190> gonna<00:01:36.310> make<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.700> best<00:01:36.910> image<00:01:37.300> possible

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.880 

once<00:01:42.610> our<00:01:42.880> pre<00:01:43.330> press<00:01:44.069> it's<00:01:45.069> finished<00:01:46.890> you'll

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
once our pre press it's finished you'll

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.410 
once our pre press it's finished you'll
notice<00:01:48.220> I'll<00:01:48.340> bring<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.819> table<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:49.360> I

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
notice I'll bring it to the table so I

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.680 
notice I'll bring it to the table so I
can<00:01:49.599> show<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.640> neoprene<00:01:52.000> sometimes<00:01:52.509> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
can show you the neoprene sometimes it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.660 
can show you the neoprene sometimes it
will<00:01:52.810> when<00:01:53.440> there's<00:01:53.619> heat<00:01:53.920> apply<00:01:54.190> it'll<00:01:54.520> have

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
will when there's heat apply it'll have

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.020 
will when there's heat apply it'll have
a<00:01:54.899> form<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.319> it<00:01:56.800> once<00:01:57.190> it<00:01:57.310> starts<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.580> cool<00:01:57.759> go

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
a form and it once it starts to cool go

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.639 
a form and it once it starts to cool go
right<00:01:58.390> back<00:01:58.569> to<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.899> way<00:01:58.989> it<00:01:59.020> was<00:01:59.319> so

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
right back to the way it was so

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.440 
right back to the way it was so
sometimes<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.190> letting<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.580> cool<00:02:00.789> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
sometimes it's just letting it cool and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.419 
sometimes it's just letting it cool and
it<00:02:01.720> will<00:02:01.840> really<00:02:02.440> make<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.679> difference<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.310> how

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
it will really make a difference and how

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.690
