00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:20.360
 hi everyone guys disc marmalade swami 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 random not randomly the agenda is all like 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.529
 always guys today is an opportunity 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.739
 dedicated patient cheek is french 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 premium tank of the eighth level on the background 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.450
 my monologue will be my sing which I 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.090
 played on the map of the airfield in the very top 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.160
 list actually want today 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.469
 tell you guys one story like 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.539
 I came to the point that I started 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.579
 play on i features 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.219
 It is worth starting with what I already play 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.499
 a long time ago and when I started playing 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.600
 the receiving store was only lavish not 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.489
 only lava rushnik later type 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.859
 repulsed as far as I remember maybe I 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.659
 I am mistaken but the point was that 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.940
 time I was still in school I did not 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.850
 I had money for the right technique 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.159
 there you bought or 14's and Churchill's plan 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.050
 I bought in general, I always got a buzz 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.300
 for example on tanks because 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.340
 time churchill and t-14 is hardly strong 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.799
 the tank is really strong and they could 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.500
 bring how are you and then I think well 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.790
 need to somehow expand 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 evolve buy so to speak 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.020
 bought more miner something on 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.360
 then generally bought a porsche 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.350
 it was my first tank of the eighth level 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.270
 1 prim and I learned how to get 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.490
 the pleasure of playing premium tanks 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.140
 the biggest disappointment in the game 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.719
 world of tanks was a nerve to me 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.250
 booking booking as correct 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.140
 I do not know 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.329
 ask for my french was peace in 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.880
 reserving superpershing now he 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.250
 somehow differently for city 26 and 1 or how 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.210
 honest guys do not remember a very long time 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 was looking at 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.189
 Exchange in general in randomness now and extremely 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.170
 small big disappointment was his nerve 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.820
 I honestly am very upset 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.219
 and thought damn what am I to do 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.780
 my favorite pier ponerfili now i 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.329
 I will not have fun 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.310
 sell it for gold bought a yacht 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.219
 I think the game seems to be some kind of legs 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.200
 appeared but i don't get the hell kicks 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.900
 there is no buzz that is yaga she is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.970
 You know very much such a machine subjective 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.269
 someone might like them not ride 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.740
 at a speed of 18 25 kilometers an hour well this 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.350
 Of course guys are not mine, I love the speaker 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.420
 that the game and I waited, I think, well, when 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.570
 I gather up there 5 to buy 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.970
 some kind of premium tank and bought 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.010
 guys fcm for me it was wild 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.740
 discoveries because legs are trenchant 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.560
 than at first in his time was of course 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.570
 pommel tankal yes could have been a dozen 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 trade dash well if your teeth are cocked 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.850
 skated mukesh just preferential prim but I 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.130
 I often rode a new platoon and got 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.680
 in the top ten for example my comrades took 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.530
 some t32 forest 3 but at that time 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.020
 it was a pier 1 and take noob platoons and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.260
 bend on preferential right in a dozen well 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.460
 then generally i started off slowly 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.980
 passive boys but guys then 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.440
 learned to play and found fcm 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.040
 this is the most versatile tank i will come 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 tried all t-34 lava and asset co 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.800
 6 I played on all tanks but only fsm 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.660
 guys gums at the cottage which is 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360
 Here in my subjective opinion 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.280
 ideal approximate tank because 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.230
 he has a dynamic he has a good 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.300
 good stabilization gun 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.400
 characteristics which served as a review 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.460
 up to a good chaotic review this is very 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.540
 important because on many premahs 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.700
 shine really sucks that's 346 Yaga 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.090
 they have a good taxi review 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.490
 overview 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.590
 Well, and the keyboard player is heavy on it 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.490
 svityaz often not necessary but 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.760
 the officer 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.550
 this is a straight wagon perfect honest 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.130
 row tank dynamics gun review 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.470
 sterilization is good relative and 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.720
 breaking through which is enough to break through 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.060
 am nines or tight straight a dozen not 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.760
 we get though again nobo platoons i 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 too then now to the user is clean 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.990
 For fun in the top ten play so 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.820
 sometimes it's fun to play there because 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.830
 well , still sometimes we dan bother 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.680
 sevens play I'm such a person that u 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.750
 playing for a long time I have to be honest 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 outgrown that process when you 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.000
 kill statistics i'm sixty 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.940
 three percent on twinks have long been holding 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.350
 about three thousand fights and therefore on 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.350
 I have a good base there too 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.970
 statistics too guys grew out of that 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.340
 age when I particularly steamed for 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.020
 statistics now I can do a bit of that stuff 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.090
 like but in a platoon getting a buzz from 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.860
 premium tanks and i don't 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.740
 keep up the talk when people whine 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.900
 about how hard it is for me to farm but 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.699
 hard not playing too game too 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.560
 General guys here and so I have a story 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.290
 I do not know whether you like it or not 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.639
 again, Iâ€™m not exactly preparing 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.040
 I wanted to boil a little 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.710
 talk about how I got to that 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.270
 life of the cord is on fs7 and that is 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.340
 my example can be guys 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.710
 subjectivity make yourself understand that fcm 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.320
 all the same good tank and in my opinion 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.930
 This is the best welcome of course still of 6 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.630
 not bad but at IS-6, of course not you 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.030
 fic by Pharma here you can pofarmit and 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.550
 besides , you can not bite you all 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.800
 knows this so that the advertisement is just that 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.580
 I want to advise you in a friendly way 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.100
 this tanchik 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.800
 and it seemed to me that the story of how I 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.020
 I bought it exactly how I got to 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.690
 the fact that I started playing someone on it 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.720
 may not seem interesting 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.160
 so that there show off that there was a lot 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.930
 tricks just guys here somehow 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.940
 I wanted to do this for you 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.280
 nice story because it is 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.750
 figure this is how a person up 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.510
 tried all the right tanks 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.900
 find here that ideal and maybe for 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.090
 someone it will be indicators not someone 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.220
 will also buy fc may be getting high 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.860
 from the game and the buzz from the game is what we are 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.289
 We all strive because you play 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.450
 already know how hard it is on git you want 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.030
 of course yes I suffer when I follow 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.950
 And when our on tanks on level 10 although 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.050
 it happens it never happens but 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.910
 again there for lags and something else 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.190
 bombs certainly not childish but again 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.590
 guys try this bombing 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.849
 maximally reduce and still 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.120
 bypass those cases when bobby is so 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.620
 not well well guys guys basically fight on 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.280
 this ends go to 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.990
 the results 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.680
 the actual result of this fighting in 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.139
 principle of a good mark 6 1 degree fighter 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.139
 duel on such a defeat Kostol 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.810
 steel wall and main gauge 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.130
 team result well, almost 4000 dagi I 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.020
 I do not know how much is in fashion now 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.350
 put on eights well in my 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.530
 subjective opinion 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.330
 me on the eight put 3 504 this 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.410
 always ok it's not tall 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.020
 the result is normal 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.720
 demand went to 6 from one thousand booty ass 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.000
 reception would go to 97 and did not shoot gold 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.920
 shells from sam very cheap it 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.720
 by the way is also a very big plus for the tank 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.600
 on which you farm because if 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.240
 was it any lava or these 34 there 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.860
 there would be a minus mist over shells there are overpayments 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.890
 thousand thirty if so good 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.680
 shoot 100000 25 35 pieces 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.690
 projectile in this i will finish the guys all 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.020
