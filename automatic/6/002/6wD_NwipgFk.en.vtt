00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the reason I do it today is so that I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080 
the reason I do it today is so that I
have<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.650> opportunity<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.700> pressure

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
have an opportunity to use my pressure

I<00:01:57.479> am<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.289> pressure<00:01:58.530> cooker<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> reason<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.020> use

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I am my pressure cooker the reason I use

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.679 
I am my pressure cooker the reason I use
a<00:02:01.259> pressure<00:02:01.530> cooker<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> doesn't

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a pressure cooker is so that it doesn't

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.260 
a pressure cooker is so that it doesn't
take<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.740> time<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> times<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.149> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
take so much time a lot of times if you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.080 
take so much time a lot of times if you
do<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.810> traditional<00:02:07.320> stock<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
do a traditional stock you have to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
do a traditional stock you have to
simmer<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.599> hours<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> hours<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.769> with<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
simmer it for hours and hours and with a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
simmer it for hours and hours and with a
pressure<00:02:11.190> cooker<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.670> takes<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.060> 45<00:02:12.510> minutes

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
pressure cooker it takes just 45 minutes

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690 
pressure cooker it takes just 45 minutes
so<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.769> other<00:02:13.920> things<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> little

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
celery and onion in your stock you're

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.780 
celery and onion in your stock you're
always<00:02:58.319> going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> add<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> little<00:02:59.250> bit<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
always going to add a little bit of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.360 
always going to add a little bit of
apple<00:03:00.239> cider<00:03:00.390> or<00:03:00.810> other<00:03:01.049> vinegar<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:02.220> your

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
apple cider or other vinegar to your

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.780 
apple cider or other vinegar to your
mixture<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.870> does<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.799> help<00:03:04.859> leach

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
mixture and what that does is help leach

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.240 
mixture and what that does is help leach
minerals<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.260> those<00:03:07.380> bones<00:03:07.739> because

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
minerals out of those bones because

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.069 
minerals out of those bones because
that's<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.180> main<00:03:09.600> point<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
that's really the main point of the

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.140 
that's really the main point of the
stock<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> really<00:03:11.819> good

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
stock is that you get a really good

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.740 
stock is that you get a really good
high-quality<00:03:13.489> gelatinous<00:03:14.489> mineral<00:03:15.299> rich

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
high-quality gelatinous mineral rich

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.960 
high-quality gelatinous mineral rich
stock<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.459> how<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.790> could<00:03:17.940> be

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
stock and you can see how that could be

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.900 
stock and you can see how that could be
good<00:03:18.239> both<00:03:18.450> for<00:03:18.480> humans<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.230> animals<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
good both for humans and animals so the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.870 
good both for humans and animals so the
next<00:03:21.120> thing<00:03:21.359> I'll<00:03:21.569> do<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:23.010> fill<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.579> guy

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
next thing I'll do is just fill this guy

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.940 
next thing I'll do is just fill this guy
up<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.389> there's<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.630> couple<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.200> markers<00:03:25.769> and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
up and there's a couple of markers and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.309 
up and there's a couple of markers and
I'll<00:03:26.069> usually<00:03:26.700> mark<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.540> fill<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
I'll usually mark it fill it up to the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.809 
I'll usually mark it fill it up to the
marker<00:03:28.799> that's<00:03:28.980> at<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.519> top<00:03:30.739> which<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:32.340> about

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
marker that's at the top which is about

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.170 
marker that's at the top which is about
eight<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.810> ten<00:03:34.049> cups<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.590> water<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:36.030> is

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
eight to ten cups of water so this is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.990 
eight to ten cups of water so this is
only<00:03:36.329> eight<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:38.700> know<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:38.970> be

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
only eight and you know would be

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270 
only eight and you know would be
perfectly<00:03:39.540> fine<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.799> can<00:03:40.980> kind<00:03:41.160> of

perfectly fine and if you can kind of
see<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.549> don't<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.209> see<00:03:42.389> from

where you are this is my mixture I'm
gonna<00:03:45.510> let<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.989> soak<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:47.280> probably<00:03:47.940> 45

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
gonna let this soak for probably 45

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.140 
gonna let this soak for probably 45
minutes<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:49.230> an<00:03:49.380> hour<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.889> kind<00:03:50.609> of<00:03:50.700> covered
