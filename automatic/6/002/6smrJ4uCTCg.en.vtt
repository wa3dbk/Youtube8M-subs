with Ninjago except for one more like a

with Ninjago except for one more like a
Lego<00:00:24.970> fit<00:00:25.240> our<00:00:25.960> wave<00:00:26.380> um<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.800> run<00:00:30.039> thing<00:00:30.250> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
Lego fit our wave um and run thing is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.379 
Lego fit our wave um and run thing is
either<00:00:32.590> they're<00:00:32.889> secretly<00:00:33.249> planning<00:00:33.609> this<00:00:33.909> or

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:36.389 
either they're secretly planning this or

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:39.539 
either they're secretly planning this or
I'm<00:00:37.389> just<00:00:37.679> pulling<00:00:38.679> stuff<00:00:39.010> out<00:00:39.219> of<00:00:39.280> nowhere

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:39.549

I'm just pulling stuff out of nowhere
here<00:00:40.030> but<00:00:41.019> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:42.460> Ninjago<00:00:43.389> might<00:00:43.929> come<00:00:44.170> back

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
here but I think Ninjago might come back

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:51.119 
here but I think Ninjago might come back
later<00:00:45.069> and<00:00:45.159> legends<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:45.969> chima<00:00:48.899> um<00:00:50.129> there

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
later and legends of chima um there

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.680 
later and legends of chima um there
could<00:00:51.280> be<00:00:51.309> some<00:00:51.549> sort<00:00:51.699> of<00:00:51.789> time<00:00:52.030> portal<00:00:52.539> or

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
could be some sort of time portal or

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.099 
could be some sort of time portal or
whatever<00:00:53.440> or<00:00:54.429> something<00:00:54.819> they<00:00:55.809> could<00:00:55.959> bring

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
whatever or something they could bring

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.869 
whatever or something they could bring
the<00:00:56.350> ninja<00:00:56.709> back<00:00:56.889> I<00:00:59.190> mean<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.549> probably

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
the ninja back I mean it probably

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.509 
the ninja back I mean it probably
wouldn't<00:01:01.149> be<00:01:01.209> like<00:01:01.389> this<00:01:01.420> year<00:01:01.889> if<00:01:02.889> they<00:01:02.949> do<00:01:03.159> it

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
wouldn't be like this year if they do it

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.009 
wouldn't be like this year if they do it
would<00:01:03.850> pop<00:01:04.119> they<00:01:04.299> probably<00:01:04.510> wait<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.780> couple

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019
