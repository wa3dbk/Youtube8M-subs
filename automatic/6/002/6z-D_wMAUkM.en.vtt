00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.569
 hello today I am particularly happy 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.340
 to be here because we're going to talk about 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.960
 one of the most interesting terminals 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.120
 that there is right now in the market and it is 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.500
 what are you seeing and is that 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.420
 You see right through 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.130
 your screen good I correct your 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.250
 spectacular screen 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 I present the samsung galaxy note the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.070
 smartphone with the largest screen 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.590
 of the market that incorporates 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.000
 very innovative functionalities but 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.809
 let's go in parts and that is that the first 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.509
 its the first 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.850
 its appearance has an elegant line is 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.019
 pretty light and notice how thin so 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.550
 only 9 65 millimeters thick is very 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.559
 well thought out its design because it combines 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.019
 Size with portability is very manageable 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.620
 and has two cameras a back of 8 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.449
 megapixel 1080p video capture 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.729
 autofocus flash image stabilizer 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.070
 and a front of 2 megapixels that we 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.500
 allows to make video calls and we go 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.939
 now with its star element this great 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.430
 impressive 5.3-inch screen 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.320
 It not with this is very easy 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.290
 visualization of contents and more 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.930
 what easy, especially how it gives a joy 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.400
 fix 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.460
 you see 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.840
 But as seen here for keeps 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.050
 the level because it has the technology 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.580
 super amoled hd that allows us 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.210
 visualize the contents with a 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.990
 Look amazing quality color 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.310
 they are vividly clear the reflection is reduced 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 as we have seen is a full screen 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.430
 touch but in this regard the samsung 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.310
 galaxy does not take a step beyond 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.750
 incorporating the spin that is a pencil 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.670
 advanced digital that when combined with 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.190
 the touch screen gives us much greater 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.600
 precision in our movements 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 what samsung has done is to integrate 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.470
 all the functions of the pencil in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850
 the terminal interface so that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.890
 if for example I want to send a message 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.210
 of text I can do it using the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.010
 keyboard or can I 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 write it from my own handwriting ' 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.430
 example 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.530
 you do 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.460
 You see that he perfectly recognizes my 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.740
 I only have to write 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.810
 send and here comes the presentation 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.400
 star of samsung galaxy you will not see 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.230
 why it's so interesting so alone 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.360
 we asked how many times throughout the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
 day we get an idea or someone gives us 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.690
 an information that we must remember or 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.330
 they give us a piece of information that we have to write down 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.100
 so that we do not forget many not 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.840
 from the shopping list to a 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.720
 new web design that has occurred to me 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.730
 suddenly for our page then in 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.490
 this sense the samsung galaxy note is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.860
 a digital notepad as well as it sounds 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.530
 we can write anything that is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.790
 happen to us at any time we open 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.320
 the application is memo that is in the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.530
 main screen and we have all 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.080
 our notes for example send to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.790
 mariah place of stay you see is normal 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.530
 I want to notice it because this 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.820
 I had forgotten but we can not only 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.890
 write but we can also 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.410
 to draw 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.330
 that is fine because it is not mine is of a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.550
 co-worker is worth 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.170
 in this if it's mine he selected it and 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.270
 so I take advantage so that you see all the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.190
 options that the application gives us in the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.170
 top bar we can choose what action 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.360
 let's create new note 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.310
 typing with the keyboard select the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.840
 tool or delete that comes first 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.970
 what am I going to do because this damages the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.910
 sight to write we look for the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.610
 tool that is more suitable 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.170
 pencil pen or marker pen and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.940
 we choose the thickness and color with the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.560
 that we want to work as it has been 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.970
 clear that the drawing is not my thing I'm going to 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.780
 Choose to write something for you to see 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.780
 how practical it is 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.560
 this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 new 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.500
 samsung 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.939
 galaxy 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.370
 and if we do not like the background, it does not happen 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.590
 nothing because there are several designs 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.510
 different I give to change background and 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.400
 I choose the one that I like the most because 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.459
 example 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.319
 You can make lists write e 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.150
 ideas concepts draw diagrams e 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.370
 even introduce other elements in 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.590
 our notes if we click on this icon or 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.810
 if we show more options to record 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.840
 audio insert image 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.000
 I'm going to for example select image 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.670
 here I am with my samsung galaxy note 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.150
 well then the image is inserted and now 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.630
 we can change the size for example or 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.850
 move it to place it where it is best 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.320
 but perfect we can share 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.540
 any note with our contacts 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.430
 social networks or even manage them 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.050
 creating folders to organize them according to 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.260
 we are interested, for example, here I have 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.120
 my things house work we can also 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.240
 link any note for example is 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.530
 from the contextual menu in more we can 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.780
 link the directly with the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.760
 planner being thus added to 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.260
 our calendar and as many times 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.120
 we have to point things in the act 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.130
 there is a shortcut so we can access 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.450
 directly notes independently of 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.670
 what we are visualizing in this 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.440
 moment we just have to press this 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.600
 pencil button that is here in a 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.400
 lateral we keep it pressed and 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.990
 press twice fast and followed in 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.640
 anywhere on the screen because 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.540
 it's already I have to send to mariah 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.070
 the site map where we have 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.170
 I'll take left to explain 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.670
 other features of the galaxy note well 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.449
 you can see the interaction and the facility 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.969
 of the work of the terminal 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.590
 first look for map and I'll do it 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.059
 using the conversation application of 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.860
 voice that is very useful when we are 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.020
 busy and we do not have full freedom of 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.969
 movements we can access it to 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.680
 through the icon or by pressing two 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.680
 fast times and followed by the home button 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.920
 and from here we can call send 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.420
 messages listen to music open 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.160
 applications to activate the 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.680
 conversation we must say a word or 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.470
 phrase that we can also customize in 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.220
 this case mine is 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.220
 'Open Sesame' 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.599
 Spain square map madrid 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.810
 to process the work 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.580
 and you see we have the map that you think 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.870
 another of the options that the 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.090
 terminal is the screenshot 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.830
 we can photograph any image that 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.960
 we are visualizing at that moment 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.740
 just press the button of the spain 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.449
 while we make a long press 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.539
 and it is now we can avoid it by 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.539
 example 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.600
 6 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.520
 kisses and that's it and we send it 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.920
 and also look at how the videos look 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.820
 in this terminal look at the quality 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.710
 for example from this video 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.150
 all this that you are seeing is possible 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.740
 thanks to the samsung galaxy not 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.180
 worked under the latest version of the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.340
 gingerbread android operating system 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.810
 which as you well know allows us 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.910
 continue to increase the benefits of 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.380
 our terminal thanks to the quantity 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.870
 huge amount of applications that we can 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.760
 download from the android market and now you 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.090
 you will ask very well very well but 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.980
 technical level that well here the galaxy does not 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.890
 continues to maintain the level because it counts 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.560
 with a dual-core 1.4 processor 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.290
 gigahertz 16 gigas of memory and one 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.180
 super fast network speed we go that 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.070
 under this elegant appearance and its 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.740
 multiple functionalities hides 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.630
 a whole beast inside him if for me 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.670
 could I keep talking about the samsung 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.140
 galaxy not all day but as not 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.630
 we have time I refer you to the video of 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.950
 samsung galaxy s2 that has recorded my 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.320
 friend javier since both terminals 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.750
 share the rest of benefits by 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.460
 wifi direct example that allows us 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.160
 transmit files much faster than 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.170
 with bluetooth or dlna technology 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.060
 that allows us to share content 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.700
 multimedia between different devices 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.220
 No need for any cables 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.780
 in order that with its screen of 5.3 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.450
 inches with super technology 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.400
 mo led hd 8 megapixel camera with 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.740
 flash incorporation and integration of 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.690
 spain the application is menu the system 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.430
 operative android and a fantastic 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.500
 performance means because now it said 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.940
 that the samsung galaxy note is one of the
