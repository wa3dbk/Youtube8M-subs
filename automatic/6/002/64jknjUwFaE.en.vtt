00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.520 
they're not gonna really look like a
normal<00:02:21.050> corndog<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.960> it'll<00:02:23.960> save<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.230> lot<00:02:24.500> of

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
normal corndog but it'll save a lot of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830 
normal corndog but it'll save a lot of
oil<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:25.400> using<00:02:25.580> coconut<00:02:25.910> oil<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.570> fry<00:02:26.720> it

the heat down so I'm thinking I need to
cook<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.410> longer<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> lower<00:03:57.310> heat<00:03:58.770> it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
cook it longer on a lower heat it

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.830

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
doesn't like I mean it looks kind of

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.500 
doesn't like I mean it looks kind of
just<00:04:02.020> like<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.170> square<00:04:02.620> corndog<00:04:03.480> before<00:04:04.480> I

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
minutes so this is the big one this is

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.200 
minutes so this is the big one this is
the<00:05:46.750> fried<00:05:47.020> one<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:48.130> big<00:05:48.310> one<00:05:48.340> definitely

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
the fried one the big one definitely

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.180

came<00:05:49.540> out<00:05:49.690> looking<00:05:49.960> prettier<00:05:50.440> I'm<00:05:50.890> gonna<00:05:51.040> go

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
came out looking prettier I'm gonna go

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.940 
came out looking prettier I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.430> compare<00:05:51.940> how<00:05:52.060> they<00:05:52.240> taste

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.830 

okay<00:05:55.950> so<00:05:56.010> I've<00:05:56.250> got<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.520> say<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:57.210> fried<00:05:57.450> one<00:05:57.660> is

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
okay so I've got to say the fried one is

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.240 
okay so I've got to say the fried one is
better<00:05:58.080> obviously

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
better obviously

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.060 
better obviously
baked<00:05:59.610> one<00:05:59.910> is<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.480> pretty<00:06:01.320> dry<00:06:01.710> on<00:06:01.950> the

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
baked one is just pretty dry on the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.890 
baked one is just pretty dry on the
outside<00:06:02.100> it's<00:06:03.000> still<00:06:03.120> good<00:06:03.420> though<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:03.750> think

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
outside it's still good though I think

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.240 
outside it's still good though I think
having<00:06:04.140> it<00:06:04.350> with<00:06:04.470> some<00:06:04.650> mustard<00:06:05.070> will

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
having it with some mustard will

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.130 
having it with some mustard will
definitely<00:06:05.730> help<00:06:05.910> that<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.480> think<00:06:06.960> it<00:06:07.020> has

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
definitely help that I think it has

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.920 
definitely help that I think it has
turned<00:06:08.010> out<00:06:08.220> much<00:06:08.430> better<00:06:08.970> than<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.480> thought<00:06:09.720> it

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
turned out much better than I thought it

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.690 
turned out much better than I thought it
would<00:06:10.110> I<00:06:10.410> mean<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:11.010> thought<00:06:11.220> it<00:06:11.400> was<00:06:11.520> a<00:06:11.580> good

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
would I mean I thought it was a good

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.340 
would I mean I thought it was a good
idea<00:06:12.030> but<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.360> thought<00:06:12.660> it<00:06:12.930> was<00:06:13.050> gonna<00:06:13.170> be<00:06:13.320> a

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350
