2014 would be agent since uh they

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.870 
2014 would be agent since uh they

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
great games but obviously not one of the

great games but obviously not one of the
main<00:01:04.049> major<00:01:04.650> titles<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> anyways<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
main major titles but anyways what do I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.679 
main major titles but anyways what do I
think<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.439> come<00:01:10.740> next<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.689> rockstar

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
think is going to come next for rockstar

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.800 
think is going to come next for rockstar
games<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.470> 2014<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> answer<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.580> nothing

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
games in 2014 the answer is nothing

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.640 
games in 2014 the answer is nothing
they're<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> release<00:01:19.409> another

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
they're not going to release another

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.630 
they're not going to release another
game<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.070> year<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.780> think<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.710> they're<00:01:23.610> all

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
game this year I think that they're all

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
game this year I think that they're all
in<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:25.140> GTA<00:01:25.710> 5<00:01:26.009> content<00:01:26.630> DLC<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.840> patches

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
in for GTA 5 content DLC and patches

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.120 
in for GTA 5 content DLC and patches
this<00:01:29.220> year<00:01:29.780> I'm<00:01:30.780> basing<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.829> simple

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
this year I'm basing that on the simple

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.780 
this year I'm basing that on the simple
fact<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.460> GTA<00:01:33.180> 4<00:01:33.890> came<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.759> 2008<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
fact that GTA 4 came out in 2008 and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
fact that GTA 4 came out in 2008 and
although<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.450> release<00:01:39.570> another<00:01:39.990> game

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
although they did release another game

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.090 
although they did release another game
that<00:01:40.470> year<00:01:40.890> i<00:01:41.159> made<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.850> lovely<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.950> was

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that year i made like lovely that was

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560 
that year i made like lovely that was
another<00:01:44.280> studio<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.299> same<00:01:45.509> year

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
another studio and it was the same year

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
another studio and it was the same year
so<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.899> doesn't<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.490> matter<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so that doesn't really matter in the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.300 
so that doesn't really matter in the
discussion<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> what's<00:01:52.020> coming<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> next

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
discussion of what's coming out the next

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.050 
discussion of what's coming out the next
year<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> next<00:01:54.659> year<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.470> live<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.250> i

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
year and the next year they live the i

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.289 
year and the next year they live the i
can't<00:01:57.420> speak<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.560> next<00:01:58.799> year<00:01:58.950> 2009<00:01:59.880> they

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
can't speak the next year 2009 they

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
can't speak the next year 2009 they
released<00:02:00.689> ballad<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.530> gay<00:02:01.649> tony<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> lost

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
released ballad of gay tony and the lost

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.139 
released ballad of gay tony and the lost
and<00:02:02.700> damned<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.890> episodes<00:02:05.729> from

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and damned so that's the episodes from

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.559 
and damned so that's the episodes from
liberty<00:02:06.450> city<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.310> i<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:09.239> assume<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
liberty city and i would assume that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.740 
liberty city and i would assume that
rockstar<00:02:10.289> games<00:02:10.849> considers<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
rockstar games considers that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.620 
rockstar games considers that
full<00:02:12.930> game<00:02:13.700> they<00:02:14.700> probably<00:02:15.000> spent<00:02:15.240> as<00:02:15.570> much

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
full game they probably spent as much

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960 
full game they probably spent as much
time<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.380> effort<00:02:16.610> building<00:02:17.610> those<00:02:17.760> two

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
time and effort building those two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.410 
time and effort building those two
episodes<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:19.500> did<00:02:19.790> building<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.060> full

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
episodes as they did building a full

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.600 
episodes as they did building a full
game<00:02:21.630> or<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.650> maybe<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.870> entirely<00:02:24.870> too

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
game or not maybe not entirely too

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.840 
game or not maybe not entirely too
entirely<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.450> uh<00:02:28.100> probably<00:02:29.100> pretty<00:02:29.670> close

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
entirely but uh probably pretty close

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.320 
entirely but uh probably pretty close
and<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.150> there's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
and because of that I think that there's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.420 
and because of that I think that there's
a<00:02:33.390> good<00:02:33.540> chance<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.260> they<00:02:34.830> will<00:02:35.040> go<00:02:35.220> all<00:02:35.400> out

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
a good chance that they will go all out

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.320 
a good chance that they will go all out
for<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:37.170> dlc<00:02:37.770> for<00:02:38.070> GTA<00:02:38.130> 5<00:02:38.580> they've<00:02:39.150> already

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
for the dlc for GTA 5 they've already

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.370 
for the dlc for GTA 5 they've already
announced<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.290> will<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.470> some<00:02:40.590> pretty

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
announced that there will be some pretty

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040 
announced that there will be some pretty
extensive<00:02:43.700> single-player<00:02:44.700> content<00:02:45.660> coming

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
extensive single-player content coming

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.000 
extensive single-player content coming
this<00:02:46.350> year<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.640> although<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.650> still

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this year so although it's still

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.040 
this year so although it's still
possible<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:51.390> might<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.660> another

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
possible that there might be another

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.970 
possible that there might be another
game<00:02:52.380> coming<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.400> year<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:54.230> doubt<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
game coming this year I doubt that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.050 
game coming this year I doubt that
because<00:02:56.580> i<00:02:56.850> feel<00:02:57.570> like<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:58.080> there<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:59.060> they

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
because i feel like if there was they

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.790 
because i feel like if there was they
probably<00:03:00.390> would<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:00.930> already<00:03:01.290> announced

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
probably would have already announced

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.580 
probably would have already announced
that<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.930> even<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.320> they<00:03:04.590> announce<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.160> soon

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
that and even if they announce it soon

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.370 
that and even if they announce it soon
they<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.950> probably<00:03:08.390> push<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> forwards<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
they will probably push it forwards so

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.260 
they will probably push it forwards so
even<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.010> supposed<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.640> announced

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
even if it was supposed to be announced

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.720 
even if it was supposed to be announced
soon<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:13.470> released<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.070> fall<00:03:14.370> it's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
soon and be released this fall it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.130 
soon and be released this fall it's
probably<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.300> pushed<00:03:15.540> forward<00:03:15.750> to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
probably going to be pushed forward to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.410 
probably going to be pushed forward to
spring<00:03:16.890> 2015<00:03:18.049> that's<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.230> how<00:03:19.440> things<00:03:19.470> work

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
spring 2015 that's just how things work

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.670 
spring 2015 that's just how things work
so<00:03:21.420> what<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.630> next<00:03:21.870> year<00:03:22.140> what<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.620> think

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
so what about next year what do I think

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.490 
so what about next year what do I think
is<00:03:23.070> next<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> next<00:03:25.290> game

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
is next what I think is the next game

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500 
is next what I think is the next game
apart<00:03:26.489> from<00:03:26.640> GTA<00:03:27.150> 5<00:03:27.360> dlc<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:29.299> going<00:03:30.299> back<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
apart from GTA 5 dlc and going back to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.960 
apart from GTA 5 dlc and going back to
this<00:03:30.780> schedule<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.830> patterns<00:03:32.370> looking

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
this schedule and the patterns looking

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
this schedule and the patterns looking
back<00:03:33.120> at<00:03:33.420> things<00:03:33.690> i<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.519> next

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
back at things i think that the next

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.140 
back at things i think that the next
game<00:03:36.060> will<00:03:36.360> be<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:37.500> spiritual<00:03:38.250> successor<00:03:38.459> or<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
game will be a spiritual successor or a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.960 
game will be a spiritual successor or a
sequel<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.780> red<00:03:40.320> dead<00:03:40.530> redemption<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:41.760> came

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
sequel to red dead redemption that came

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.310 
sequel to red dead redemption that came
out<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.230> 2010<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.709> that's<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.100> year<00:03:44.310> after<00:03:44.549> the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
out in 2010 so that's the year after the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.710 
out in 2010 so that's the year after the
episodes<00:03:46.320> from<00:03:46.700> libera<00:03:47.700> libera<00:03:47.970> Liberty<00:03:48.600> City

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
episodes from libera libera Liberty City

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.080 
episodes from libera libera Liberty City
and<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:50.390> feel<00:03:51.390> very<00:03:51.750> confident<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.590> that

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
and I feel very confident in that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.220 
and I feel very confident in that
assumption<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.390> mean<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.750> feel<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:54.989> that's

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
assumption I mean I feel like that's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.750 
assumption I mean I feel like that's
very<00:03:55.650> probable<00:03:56.570> game<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:58.110> come<00:03:58.290> next<00:03:58.470> um<00:03:58.829> it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
very probable game to come next um it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.390 
very probable game to come next um it
was<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.180> popular<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.690> yeah<00:04:03.690> I

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
was so popular you know and yeah I

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.210 
was so popular you know and yeah I
really<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.410> reddit<00:04:07.410> redemption<00:04:08.070> or

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
really think that reddit redemption or

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.390 
really think that reddit redemption or
reddit<00:04:08.790> another<00:04:09.510> reddit<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.380> very<00:04:11.100> likely

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
reddit another reddit is very likely

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.930 
reddit another reddit is very likely
candidate<00:04:12.390> for<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.989> next<00:04:13.230> game<00:04:13.640> another<00:04:14.640> one

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
candidate for the next game another one

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.440 
candidate for the next game another one
I<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.420> likely<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.440> come<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.850> bully

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
I think is likely to come up is a bully

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.140 
I think is likely to come up is a bully
2<00:04:18.720> or<00:04:19.049> whatever<00:04:19.440> believe<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.729> want<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.000> call

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
2 or whatever believe they want to call

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.110 
2 or whatever believe they want to call
it<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:22.169> don't<00:04:23.160> know<00:04:23.250> if<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.550> sold<00:04:23.820> very<00:04:24.000> well

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it I don't know if it's sold very well

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.510 
it I don't know if it's sold very well
when<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.570> came<00:04:24.750> out<00:04:24.780> but

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
when it came out but

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.279 
when it came out but
so<00:04:25.819> I<00:04:25.940> feel<00:04:26.270> like<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.569> became<00:04:26.840> kind<00:04:27.139> of<00:04:27.199> a

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
so I feel like that became kind of a

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.550 
so I feel like that became kind of a
cult<00:04:27.440> classic<00:04:27.949> when<00:04:28.789> it<00:04:28.879> was<00:04:29.030> released<00:04:29.560> for

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
cult classic when it was released for

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.610 
cult classic when it was released for

Houser<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.449> think<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:50.930> many<00:04:51.080> others<00:04:51.409> have<00:04:51.590> said

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
Houser I think and many others have said

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.070 
Houser I think and many others have said
in<00:04:52.069> interviews<00:04:52.639> that<00:04:52.819> they<00:04:53.330> really<00:04:53.539> liked<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
in interviews that they really liked the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.749 
in interviews that they really liked the
game<00:04:54.259> and<00:04:54.470> want<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.830> make<00:04:55.099> another<00:04:55.250> one<00:04:55.550> so

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
game and want to make another one so

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.689 
game and want to make another one so
that's<00:04:56.690> another<00:04:57.020> possibility<00:04:57.430> but<00:04:58.430> if<00:04:58.580> they

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
that's another possibility but if they

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.610 
that's another possibility but if they
got<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:58.970> choose<00:04:59.240> between<00:04:59.419> those<00:04:59.750> two<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.229> think

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
got to choose between those two I think

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.740 
got to choose between those two I think
red<00:05:01.069> dead<00:05:01.220> redemption<00:05:01.370> we<00:05:01.789> would<00:05:02.300> be<00:05:02.479> more

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
red dead redemption we would be more

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.920 
red dead redemption we would be more
likely<00:05:03.020> as<00:05:03.380> it's<00:05:03.650> way<00:05:04.069> more<00:05:04.099> popular<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.930> it's

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
likely as it's way more popular and it's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.370 
likely as it's way more popular and it's
already<00:05:06.319> been<00:05:06.470> four<00:05:07.389> soon<00:05:08.389> five<00:05:08.690> years<00:05:09.020> since

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
already been four soon five years since

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.640 
already been four soon five years since
red<00:05:10.009> dead<00:05:10.190> redemption<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.909> I<00:05:11.259> think<00:05:12.259> that's<00:05:12.440> a

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
red dead redemption so I think that's a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.890 
red dead redemption so I think that's a
good<00:05:12.979> possibility<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:14.330> when<00:05:14.509> it<00:05:14.599> comes<00:05:14.750> to

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
good possibility and when it comes to

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.770 
good possibility and when it comes to
agent<00:05:15.289> why<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.800> won't<00:05:16.159> be<00:05:16.400> next<00:05:16.780> there's

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
agent why that won't be next there's

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.020 
agent why that won't be next there's
many<00:05:17.990> reasons<00:05:18.169> first<00:05:18.860> office<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.669> was

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
many reasons first office it was

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.640 
many reasons first office it was
supposed<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.389> be<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.569> playstation<00:05:21.139> 3<00:05:21.319> exclusive

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
supposed to be a playstation 3 exclusive

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.149 
supposed to be a playstation 3 exclusive
and<00:05:22.509> the<00:05:23.509> next<00:05:23.780> gen<00:05:23.990> consoles<00:05:24.500> are<00:05:24.800> already

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
and the next gen consoles are already

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.110 
and the next gen consoles are already
here<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.360> if<00:05:26.750> it<00:05:26.930> was<00:05:26.960> going<00:05:27.409> to<00:05:27.650> come<00:05:27.800> out<00:05:27.949> as<00:05:28.310> a

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
here so if it was going to come out as a

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.870 
here so if it was going to come out as a
late<00:05:29.539> PlayStation<00:05:30.259> 3<00:05:30.500> game<00:05:30.610> we<00:05:31.610> would<00:05:31.789> have

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
late PlayStation 3 game we would have

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.879 
late PlayStation 3 game we would have
already<00:05:32.030> heard<00:05:32.419> about<00:05:32.569> it<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:32.990> think<00:05:33.349> we<00:05:33.650> create

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
already heard about it I think we create

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.010 
already heard about it I think we create
sure<00:05:34.099> I<00:05:34.130> mean<00:05:34.370> releasing<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.300> PlayStation<00:05:35.810> 3

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
sure I mean releasing a PlayStation 3

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.399 
sure I mean releasing a PlayStation 3
game<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.560> big<00:05:37.550> PlayStation<00:05:38.419> 3<00:05:38.599> game<00:05:38.630> like<00:05:39.050> agent

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
game a big PlayStation 3 game like agent

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.740 
game a big PlayStation 3 game like agent
would<00:05:39.530> be<00:05:39.650> in<00:05:40.069> late<00:05:40.789> 2014<00:05:41.599> or<00:05:42.050> or<00:05:42.860> in<00:05:43.669> 2015<00:05:44.479> that

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
would be in late 2014 or or in 2015 that

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.100 
would be in late 2014 or or in 2015 that
sounds<00:05:45.500> very<00:05:45.800> unlikely<00:05:46.279> to<00:05:46.550> me<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:47.110> another

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
sounds very unlikely to me and another

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.450 
sounds very unlikely to me and another
reason<00:05:48.380> why<00:05:49.099> it<00:05:49.159> wouldn't<00:05:49.250> be<00:05:49.729> agent<00:05:50.479> is<00:05:50.690> that

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
reason why it wouldn't be agent is that

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.680 
reason why it wouldn't be agent is that
agent<00:05:52.460> is<00:05:52.639> supposed<00:05:52.759> to<00:05:53.029> be<00:05:53.120> developed<00:05:53.539> by

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
agent is supposed to be developed by

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.760 
agent is supposed to be developed by
rockstar<00:05:54.139> north<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:56.319> rockstar<00:05:57.319> north<00:05:57.469> yes

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
rockstar north and rockstar north yes

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.980 
rockstar north and rockstar north yes
released<00:05:58.219> breadth<00:05:58.699> or<00:05:58.909> five<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.630> they're

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
released breadth or five and they're

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.779 
released breadth or five and they're
working<00:06:00.620> hard<00:06:00.650> on<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.819> dlc<00:06:02.240> for<00:06:02.419> GTA<00:06:02.479> 5<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.789> so

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
working hard on the dlc for GTA 5 and so

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.820 
working hard on the dlc for GTA 5 and so
i<00:06:04.819> really<00:06:05.330> doubt<00:06:05.599> that<00:06:05.659> we'll<00:06:06.259> be<00:06:06.289> seeing

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
i really doubt that we'll be seeing

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.409 
i really doubt that we'll be seeing
agent<00:06:07.279> anytime<00:06:07.699> soon<00:06:09.759> yeah<00:06:10.759> so<00:06:11.029> that's<00:06:11.210> my

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
agent anytime soon yeah so that's my

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.499 
agent anytime soon yeah so that's my
assumptions<00:06:12.050> red<00:06:12.919> dead<00:06:13.069> redemption<00:06:13.509> to

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
assumptions red dead redemption to

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.510 
assumptions red dead redemption to
whatever<00:06:15.259> or<00:06:15.520> bully<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:17.860> those<00:06:18.860> are<00:06:19.219> my<00:06:19.460> two

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
whatever or bully to those are my two

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.409 
whatever or bully to those are my two
most<00:06:19.880> likely<00:06:20.300> candidates<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:22.270> think<00:06:23.270> we're

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
most likely candidates I think we're

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.050 
most likely candidates I think we're
gonna<00:06:23.539> see<00:06:23.779> one<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:23.990> those<00:06:24.110> in<00:06:24.469> 2015<00:06:25.069> I<00:06:25.310> would

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
gonna see one of those in 2015 I would

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.100
