00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello, how are I going to teach you how to do it? 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 We could have ordered the rolls 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.200
 several look first always throw it a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.200
 bit 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.760
 we make a line aside always less 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.420
 on this side and more on this side that 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.150
 It's wrong and now if you have long hair 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.710
 as I take a room the head does not 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.720
 you take from here back if you have the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.180
 hair can not catch it or be more 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.070
 you can catch it from further back to 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.760
 that the hair does not fall has to be a 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.290
 little room of hair brushing and now 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.150
 we leave the hair loose 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.780
 well, if you leave braces it is very bad 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.630
 the role we put our hand inside 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.420
 we turn we turn we turn we take the point 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.250
 of the hair and we started to turn it to 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.960
 give it back very important appointment our 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 lucky the beginning of the hair and you see 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.250
 and even take it up here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.320
 because there it is at the tip of the hair 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.320
 so that it does not escape important rises 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.409
 if you want some fruit to remain if you 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.149
 makes a tad and is hollow 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.210
 Well, I have left a fork that 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.360
 see a little 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.540
 no more than anything what I want you to see 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.180
 It is the technique of how to do this see 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.479
 with practices here you can hold a 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.090
 little there to throw a tint of lacquer now 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.329
 we would take the other 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.969
 the other portion of hair there I do not know if 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.700
 I see it well equal not chosen more 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.289
 ethically hair that leaves us with 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.980
 the other hand we do the same there 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.290
 we rotate we turn careful and the woman still 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.230
 and now this the most difficult thing about everything 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.750
 on this side if we are right-handed turning 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.690
 and we turn it around a little bit 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.710
 and this is a little more tight 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.210
 will be a tad uglier 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.210
 but good technique there 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.660
 the theme is weaker are aspiring 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.660
 sorry 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.890
 this time has been a little 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.900
 as long as the fork passes through the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.860
 half of the roll because if you do not see it falls 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860
 one with the other 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.900
 a neighbor falls 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.560
 from the stand a little weaker but 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.230
 well basically it's what you see is a 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.390
 little strategic 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 now we would only give the hair and 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 we could make a few enclosures a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.450
 picked up from behind that was 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.230
 type well 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.110
 A) Yes 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.379
 you will see that it is also very good and with 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.019
 one with some flowers always try 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.110
 a council then everyone does what 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.580
 wants the clips that remain on the side 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 that less still are enough because 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.610
 is aesthetically nicer is not 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.830
 so ornate the hairstyle 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.080
 harem would be like that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.660
 Well I hope you have seen me well 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.660
 that you liked and this has been the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.660
 bye
