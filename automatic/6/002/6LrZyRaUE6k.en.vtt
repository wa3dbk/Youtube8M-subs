00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.629
 well these m2 to one lived news the 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.919
 really quite serious that I think that 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.390
 go sad wax many people 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.700
 we still do not know what can reach 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.889
 mean , but it does not look good 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.110
 the truth I'm going to say at zero no 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.289
 It looks good the brand of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.080
 guards has not been has been 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.199
 I left directly from the 16th today 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.990
 same has been abandoned by by are and 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.280
 If I'm not mistaken, it's the one 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.320
 have the same one because they are 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.560
 this brand you know how good of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 guardians a game developed by the 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.300
 people who were behind so much doctor 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.970
 as colored health its in which its 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.910
 director encouraged fumito ueda well then 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.870
 he has lent his address and so on 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 obviously basically good we already know 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.940
 that the relationships between age and are and 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.739
 they have not been good adaptation 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.860
 of the game that was presented in 2009 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.900
 it has not been very clear either 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.309
 for a long time it was not known if 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.199
 I would go out for just that to peel 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.940
 there are four of them and in the end it seems that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.770
 leave the mark this or you can 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.810
 say it can be said to be canceled 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.880
 game although it will change its name there 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 those two possibilities I really do not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 I know I do not know what you can get involved young 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.140
 already a lot of not seeing a game already of this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.310
 people because the truth is that we have 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.080
 very good memories we have 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.479
 played there colla of those days or the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.750
 colossus and this game had a pint 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 brutal too and hopefully not what 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 cancel that is simply a change 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 name and you 're done 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.170
 to put another and point but good has 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 a real bitch that they cancel in the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.790
 game yes watching and other extras 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.100
 this can not be true we will see to see 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.600
 they renew it or something shortly 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.790
 I do not know I do not know they're jumping 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.350
 alarms right now has served no 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.560
