00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.260
 good runners and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 video of programs barcelona what 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.879
 promised is debt and here to clean them 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 we have the comparison between the accumulation 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.259
 is 15 and q least 14 will see the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.209
 major differences that meet 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.830
 these two shoes in the changes that 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.890
 have been applied in some 15 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.480
 Gentlemen Diaz is one of the differences 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 main ones that incorporates the as the 15 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
 is that you have unified the gel plate that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.360
 wears in the heel remember that in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.520
 formula 14 the gel plate was 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.279
 sectioned into two parts and now as 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.980
 the 15 has notified her in the same 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 gel plate to concentrate all the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 cushioning on the trackpad that is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.039
 normally where we received the first 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 impact the way he tells us too 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.969
 incorporates a small plate of geron 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.769
 metatarsos that is going to make our 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.289
 transition in the tread especially 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.510
 when we push it is a bit softer 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.489
 and a little more comfortable all those people 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 more also makes the shoe 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 about 10-15 grams heavier than 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 accumulation of 14 but the action lords 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.190
 think everything and to counter this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.809
 They have done the following to explain 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.399
 this difference in a few words from 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 trust and that is a plastic insert 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.670
 that are incorporated 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 or plant the shoe exactly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.620
 here as we can see in the q2 14 this 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.200
 insert covers everything to the plantar arch 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.390
 while at the summit the 15 have 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 sectioned this insert in two parts 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 leaving the middle part completely 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 free for a more transient tread and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 more dynamic 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.270
 these differences in this fifteenth 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.910
 edition of the accumulation is not change anything 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 how the 15 has some weight but 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.720
 that makes up for it with great comfort and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.550
 a durability of between 1000 and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.870
 1200 kilometers of cushioning 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.940
 effective so it's taken 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.979
 some 14 do not hesitate to continue in this 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.260
 range of shoes because here you are not going to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.010
 fail if you have already run with 14 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.850
