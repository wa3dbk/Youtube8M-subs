00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.710 

at<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.309> begin<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.820> was<00:00:34.970> it<00:00:35.269> was<00:00:35.420> for<00:00:35.600> sure

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
at the begin it was it was for sure

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.760 
at the begin it was it was for sure
coupons<00:00:36.280> but<00:00:37.280> then<00:00:37.460> after<00:00:37.790> race<00:00:37.970> -<00:00:38.469> he<00:00:39.469> doesn't

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
coupons but then after race - he doesn't

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.209 
coupons but then after race - he doesn't
drive<00:00:40.070> anymore<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.790> yeah<00:00:41.300> I<00:00:41.570> think<00:00:42.100> after<00:00:43.100> the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
drive anymore and yeah I think after the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.560 
drive anymore and yeah I think after the
middle<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> season<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.120> was<00:00:44.149> for<00:00:44.390> sure<00:00:44.540> I

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
middle of the season it was for sure I

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.510 
middle of the season it was for sure I
got<00:00:44.840> see<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:45.500> I<00:00:45.530> think<00:00:45.829> it<00:00:45.920> was<00:00:46.040> not<00:00:46.190> easy<00:00:46.430> for

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
got see but I think it was not easy for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.510 
got see but I think it was not easy for
him<00:00:46.700> because<00:00:46.910> at<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.510> first<00:00:47.690> races<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.469> I<00:00:49.460> do

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
him because at the first races I I do

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.970 
him because at the first races I I do
have<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.120> small<00:00:50.420> gap<00:00:50.840> with<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.410> points<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.800> him

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
have a small gap with the points of him

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.340 
have a small gap with the points of him
and<00:00:52.160> then<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.120> was<00:00:53.270> very<00:00:53.300> difficult<00:00:53.780> for<00:00:54.079> him

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and then it was very difficult for him

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.470 
and then it was very difficult for him
to<00:00:54.590> close<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.010> gap<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.370> yeah<00:00:55.850> it<00:00:56.000> was<00:00:56.180> for<00:00:56.360> me

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
to close the gap and yeah it was for me

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.319 
to close the gap and yeah it was for me
only<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.899> not<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.680> win<00:00:57.829> races<00:00:58.010> not<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.670> take<00:00:59.210> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
only to not to win races not to take the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.450 
only to not to win races not to take the
victories<00:00:59.629> home<00:00:59.809> only<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:01.129> take<00:01:01.340> the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
victories home only to to take the

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.119 
victories home only to to take the
points<00:01:01.820> on<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.870> not<00:01:03.050> bad<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.469> win<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.009> race

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
points on it's not bad to win the race

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.300 
points on it's not bad to win the race
this<00:01:04.280> year

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.000 

the<00:01:11.730> nicest<00:01:12.120> race<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.750> season<00:01:13.050> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.620> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the nicest race this season I think it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
the nicest race this season I think it
was<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.520> second<00:01:15.120> race<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.300> Hungary<00:01:16.290> ring

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
was the second race in Hungary ring

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.180 
was the second race in Hungary ring
because<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.670> hear<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> never<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.200> driver<00:01:19.470> was

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
because I hear that never one driver was

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.550 
because I hear that never one driver was
doing<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> Hedrick<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.170> three<00:01:22.350> races

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
doing the Hedrick in all the three races

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
doing the Hedrick in all the three races
so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.090> first<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so I think it was the first in the in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.980 
so I think it was the first in the in
the<00:01:25.290> history<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.650> Maserati<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> yeah<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.780> makes

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the history of Maserati so yeah it makes

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the history of Maserati so yeah it makes
me<00:01:28.160> really<00:01:29.160> happy<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.700> yeah<00:01:30.440> it's<00:01:31.440> not<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> was

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
me really happy and yeah it's not it was

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.930 
me really happy and yeah it's not it was
not<00:01:32.040> easy<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.670> after<00:01:33.660> race<00:01:34.140> -<00:01:34.850> after<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
not easy but after race - after the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.270 
not easy but after race - after the
second<00:01:36.240> victory<00:01:36.480> in<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:37.230> Hungary<00:01:37.530> ring<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
it's a nice car to drive because now in

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.090 
it's a nice car to drive because now in
this<00:03:24.910> year<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:25.270> have<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.450> bit<00:03:25.690> more<00:03:25.720> of

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
this year we have a bit more of

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.580 
this year we have a bit more of
aerodynamics<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.370> bit<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.450> of<00:03:28.630> grip<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
aerodynamics a bit more of grip in the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.680 
aerodynamics a bit more of grip in the
in<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.190> front<00:03:30.520> so<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:33.069> more<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> race<00:03:34.060> car

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
in the front so you it's more a race car

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.170 
in the front so you it's more a race car
so<00:03:35.020> even<00:03:35.530> every<00:03:36.010> year<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.459> more<00:03:36.700> like<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.940> race

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
so even every year it's more like a race

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.470 
so even every year it's more like a race
car<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.340> easy<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.970> not<00:03:40.060> easy<00:03:40.150> to

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
car and it was not easy it's not easy to

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.660 
car and it was not easy it's not easy to
drive<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.200> like<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.650> style<00:03:41.830> how<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.100> have<00:03:42.640> to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670
