00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
review on the modded lost driver as you

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.710 
review on the modded lost driver as you
can<00:00:18.450> see<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.010> original<00:00:20.400> DX<00:00:21.330> lost

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
can see this is not the original DX lost

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.710 
can see this is not the original DX lost
driver<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.890> Korean<00:00:23.510> double<00:00:24.510> driver

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
driver this is my Korean double driver

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.849 
driver this is my Korean double driver
modded<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:26.100> the<00:00:26.340> lost<00:00:26.580> driver<00:00:27.500> it's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.650> very

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
modded into the lost driver it's a very

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.880 
modded into the lost driver it's a very
simple<00:00:29.070> process<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.600> do<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.020> go

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
simple process all you have to do is go

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.149 
simple process all you have to do is go
to<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.629> unscrew<00:00:33.629> all<00:00:33.659> this<00:00:34.050> remove<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
to the back unscrew all this remove that

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.669 
to the back unscrew all this remove that
take<00:00:35.789> some<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> subtle<00:00:36.510> pieces<00:00:37.019> that

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
take some of the subtle pieces that

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.569 
take some of the subtle pieces that
connect<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.929> the<00:00:39.929> shorter<00:00:40.379> o<00:00:40.409> side<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:41.069> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
connect the the shorter o side of the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.410 
connect the the shorter o side of the
driver<00:00:42.229> remove<00:00:43.229> this<00:00:43.499> piece<00:00:43.800> right<00:00:44.129> here

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
driver remove this piece right here

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.029 
driver remove this piece right here
remove<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.600> arm<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> put<00:00:46.679> it<00:00:46.769> all<00:00:46.889> back

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
remove that arm and put it all back

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.059 
remove that arm and put it all back
together<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.679> made<00:00:49.889> your

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
together and then you have made your

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.279 
together and then you have made your
last<00:00:50.190> driver<00:00:50.569> you<00:00:51.569> can<00:00:51.690> tell<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.109> has

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
last driver you can tell that this has

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.279 
last driver you can tell that this has
been<00:00:52.409> modded<00:00:52.799> because<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.370> piece<00:00:54.139> you<00:00:55.139> can

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
been modded because this piece you can

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.329 
been modded because this piece you can
see<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.709> the<00:00:55.859> one<00:00:55.979> of<00:00:56.069> the<00:00:56.129> inner

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
see that's the one of the inner

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.979 
see that's the one of the inner
mechanisms<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.089> you<00:00:57.209> can<00:00:57.299> see<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> rotating

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
mechanisms here you can see it rotating

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
mechanisms here you can see it rotating
the<00:00:58.559> DX<00:00:59.190> versions<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.209> to<00:01:00.269> see

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the DX versions you're not going to see

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
the DX versions you're not going to see
that<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.159> this<00:01:02.339> hole<00:01:02.639> right<00:01:02.969> here

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that and you see this hole right here

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.910 
that and you see this hole right here
that's<00:01:03.479> what's<00:01:03.749> the<00:01:03.809> aid<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.770> of<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that's what's the aid in some of the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.400 
that's what's the aid in some of the
transformation<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.410> transmission

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
transformation see on the transmission

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.920 
transformation see on the transmission
function<00:01:07.710> functions<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.730> so<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.810> would

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
function functions of this so it would

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
function functions of this so it would
it<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.110> covered<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> mole<00:01:11.430> n<00:01:11.640> don't<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.150> better

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it be covered and mole n don't be better

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.170 
it be covered and mole n don't be better
molding<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.380> besides<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
molding there but besides that it is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.750 
molding there but besides that it is
exactly<00:01:15.740> what<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.010> get<00:01:17.190> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.580> watch

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
exactly what you would get if you watch

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.210 
exactly what you would get if you watch
the<00:01:17.910> lost<00:01:18.090> driver<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.410> just<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.010> show<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the lost driver and just to show you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.870 
the lost driver and just to show you
here<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.330> pieces<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:23.250> comes<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.670> put

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
here is the pieces it comes with a put

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
here is the pieces it comes with a put
it<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> bag<00:01:24.410> with<00:01:25.410> some<00:01:25.620> school<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.990> but

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it in the bag with some school there but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.210 
it in the bag with some school there but
that<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.290> inside<00:01:28.530> cuz<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that time inside cuz you don't need it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.870 
that time inside cuz you don't need it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.690 
create your own lost driver if you have
a<00:02:22.820> second<00:02:23.600> double<00:02:24.290> driver<00:02:24.530> if<00:02:24.860> not<00:02:25.430> you're

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a second double driver if not you're

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
a second double driver if not you're
just<00:02:25.850> gonna<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.180> put<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.450> back<00:02:26.510> together

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
just gonna have to put it back together

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.300 
just gonna have to put it back together
again<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.350> able<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.590> do<00:02:27.709> any<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> things
