00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
over say 20 25 then go too much over

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.570 
over say 20 25 then go too much over
that<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.400> trucks<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.030> loose<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that but my trucks are really loose and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
that but my trucks are really loose and
I<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:17.970> original<00:01:18.860> barrel<00:01:19.860> bushing<00:01:19.979> zip

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I was at original barrel bushing zip

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
I was at original barrel bushing zip
they<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
they have on there I like them and I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.510 
they have on there I like them and I
have<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.990> BEC<00:01:27.990> 11<00:01:28.350> free<00:01:28.530> rides<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> center<00:01:29.340> set

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have a BEC 11 free rides the center set

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590 
have a BEC 11 free rides the center set
one's<00:01:30.350> been<00:01:31.350> riding<00:01:31.680> these<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> while<00:01:32.600> off

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
one's been riding these for a while off

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
one's been riding these for a while off
and<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:33.990> between<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> retro<00:01:34.829> free<00:01:35.220> rides

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and on between the retro free rides

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
and on between the retro free rides
because<00:01:35.850> they're<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.750> bit<00:01:36.900> harder<00:01:37.229> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because they're a little bit harder so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.359 
because they're a little bit harder so
they<00:01:37.500> last<00:01:37.710> longer<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.220> more

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
they last longer but these are more

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
they last longer but these are more
consistent<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.710> put<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.920> back<00:01:44.070> on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
consistent I think so put them back on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.490 
consistent I think so put them back on
here<00:01:44.399> I've<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:47.479> other<00:01:48.479> wheels<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.960> money

destroying<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.340> kind<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.329> cool<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.190> think<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
destroying it kind of cool I think this

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.759 
destroying it kind of cool I think this
is<00:02:59.340> better<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.970> other<00:03:00.269> one<00:03:00.420> from<00:03:00.810> my

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
is better than the other one from my

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.970 
is better than the other one from my
short<00:03:02.070> hour<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.989> writing<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:05.510> um<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
short hour or so writing it um so you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.470 
short hour or so writing it um so you
would<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.250> pretty<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.269> same

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
would have pretty much the same

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.590 
would have pretty much the same
dimensions<00:03:10.290> except<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:10.680> length<00:03:11.420> concave<00:03:12.420> I

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
dimensions except for length concave I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.440 
dimensions except for length concave I
think<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.019> cool<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.290> day<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:14.299> don't<00:03:15.299> know<00:03:15.359> if

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
think it's cool that day I don't know if

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.650 
think it's cool that day I don't know if
you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.660> see<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:17.000> how<00:03:18.000> are<00:03:18.180> they<00:03:18.329> kind<00:03:18.630> of

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you can see this how are they kind of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.220 
you can see this how are they kind of
smooth<00:03:19.079> out<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.620> edge<00:03:19.980> right<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:21.230> because

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
smooth out this edge right here because

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.300 
smooth out this edge right here because
on<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:23.569> other<00:03:24.569> one<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.049> was<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.620> part

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
on the other one it was like this part

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.940 
on the other one it was like this part
right<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.660> or<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:28.049> hard<00:03:28.350> rail<00:03:28.680> they

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
right here or just a hard rail they

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460 
right here or just a hard rail they
smooth<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.549> out<00:03:29.579> which<00:03:30.480> gives<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.170> little

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
smooth it out which gives you a little

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.330 
smooth it out which gives you a little
bit<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.709> space<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.640> your<00:03:32.819> wheels<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
bit more space with your wheels so you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.460 
bit more space with your wheels so you
get<00:03:35.549> less<00:03:35.819> chance<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.329> wheel<00:03:36.510> bikes<00:03:36.750> actually

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
get less chance of wheel bikes actually

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.430 
get less chance of wheel bikes actually
had<00:03:37.739> wheel<00:03:38.010> bite<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.430> area<00:03:39.200> with<00:03:40.200> my

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
had wheel bite in this area with my

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
had wheel bite in this area with my
other<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:40.829> because<00:03:41.340> i<00:03:41.519> had<00:03:41.670> my<00:03:41.790> trucks<00:03:42.180> way

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
other one because i had my trucks way

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.890 
other one because i had my trucks way

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
too loose I don't know like when I first

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.449 
too loose I don't know like when I first
got<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.949 

yeah<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:54.030> first<00:03:55.030> impression<00:03:55.630> /

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
review is like yeah no flex I'm like 59

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.640 
review is like yeah no flex I'm like 59
so<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.540> pretty<00:04:04.840> comfortable<00:04:05.910> slightly

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
so this is pretty comfortable slightly

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.380 
so this is pretty comfortable slightly
wider<00:04:08.650> than<00:04:08.739> shoulder-width<00:04:09.370> apart<00:04:09.580> my

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
wider than shoulder-width apart my

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.250 
wider than shoulder-width apart my
stamps<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:12.160> enough<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.520> my<00:04:12.640> tuck<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:14.110> your

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
stamps just enough for my tuck if your

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.430 
stamps just enough for my tuck if your
in<00:04:14.350> T<00:04:14.410> taller<00:04:14.620> than<00:04:14.860> I<00:04:14.950> am<00:04:14.980> then<00:04:15.780> another<00:04:16.780> 59
