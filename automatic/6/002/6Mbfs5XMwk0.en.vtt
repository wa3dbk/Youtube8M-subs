00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.810
 Speaks beauty, another video to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.640
 you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.919
 and this time I'm here with photoshop 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 returned to win in the tutorial doing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.200
 Overall, it's cool for you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.540
 so let's go well in total today I 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'm teaching you how to make an effect. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 professional camera 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
 well I do not know how it's the same name 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.830
 this done 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.550
 but that effect that when you take 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.529
 a picture is something stands out and the background 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 it gets totally totally fogged up 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 blurry then let's go 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.570
 Good, I found this image on the internet. 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 as an example I could not find another 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.640
 I just had this damn picture 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 but anyway let's go 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 is good to start from scratch again used the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.690
 photoshop cs5 has several versions have the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.550
 674 anyway you can use any version 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 that this effect will work 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.719
 well come on then go and indict the image 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.090
 usually in photoshop and here in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 layer we will duplicate it securely 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.950
 it 's not because we are against the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.020
 you can see that it has created a new layer and 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.080
 now we are going to select what the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.400
 people want what we want them to stay 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
 crisp ok 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.009
 Good, I'll get this tool that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 quick selection enlarge here holding 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.320
 out and scrolling mouse scroll and beauty 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.350
 is already well approximated to the flight increase 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.430
 a little in the corner more or less let 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.430
 11 pixels and began to select the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.590
 Image 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.050
 It has some points that it will not get 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.050
 totally perfect but that's what we 're going to do 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.730
 according to the video of one year 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.680
 Okay, but this point now. 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.170
 can see that one of the parts here he 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.290
 He passed, he was not well selected. 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.760
 let's mark this option of less here 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 to remove the selection has decreased a bit 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:10.899
 I'll go a little further on the image. 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 here and I will take the selection of these points 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.280
 Is there when you go and you? 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.500
 can be doing more accurately or 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.630
 I'm talking here anyway 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.450
 even just for the tutorial is not only the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.280
 video then this is the way the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.239
 People are going to do let's reverse this. 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.820
 selection 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.709
 good as we will do it has 2 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.420
 two ways that can do it well 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.510
 to select is to reverse if not you press 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.280
 shift against the wii in the same 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.470
 now you may notice that it just goes 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.080
 to be selecting background what people 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.730
 will do without filter 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.800
 It's the blur Glaucian blur ok the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 cause I do not know how to speak 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.480
 we stayed here once you've seen one 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.610
 Touch him, he's coming to tell you guys 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.640
 So we'll sort this out here. 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.850
 to see that it is very strong then here 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 In this radius we are regulating a good 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.900
 that I like 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.070
 It's more or less a movie at 0 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.800
 who is not so stressed and not even 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.270
 little focused for you to fix you 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.020
 put much less this varies from your 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.120
 Image 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.890
 this image here I think it would be a 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.370
 Good 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.100
 so here we have here and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.970
 pressed against the d to remove the 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.810
 and you are ready to see that the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.820
 background was embarrassed and this statue 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.420
 to this status and object here he stayed 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.040
 clear neat 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
 then this is more or less the function 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.690
 If it is done, I do not remember the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.920
 effect but I'll put a good title 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.810
 there in the video and that's it, I hope 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.220
 that you liked liked you click 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.620
 and I liked it 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.769
 It's the second favorite if possible and you 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.120
 new channel and is very 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.790
