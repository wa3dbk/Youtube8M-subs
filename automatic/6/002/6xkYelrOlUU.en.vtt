00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello my name is hope 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.189
 Viktorovna Levina 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.639
 theme of our today's occupation of cloth 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.860
 human tissue is a collection of cells and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
 intercellular substance combined 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 common origin and structure 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.990
 performing a specific tissue function 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.960
 in the human body is a kind of four 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 epithelial or integumentary tissue 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 muscle tissue connective tissue and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 nervous tissue let's talk more about 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 every kind of fabric 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.899
 let's start epithelial epithelial tissue 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.780
 or integumentary tissue cells and and small 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.280
 very often they share almost no 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.690
 intercellular substance and cell 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 are located close tightly to each other 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 epithelial tissue and non tissue 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 consists of the skin of the mucous membrane and 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.399
 serous membranes of organs as well 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 epithelial tissue forms glands 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 epithelial tissue function is protection 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 mechanical protection first 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.409
 UV protection this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.479
 keep in mind skin is protection from 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 alien penetration tom 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.409
 including immune protection also in cells 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.060
 skin is a secretory function 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 epithelial tissue that makes up 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.200
 glands there are so-called ciliated 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.369
 or ciliated epithelium which 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.729
 lines the upper airways 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.920
 epithelial tissue is divided into 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 single layer and multilayer epithelium 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.689
 multilayer is orga viva how yuschy 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119
 time which consists of skin and not horn viva 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.990
 yuschy a single and St. Petersburg, and there are 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 single row and multi row moreover 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.579
 epithelial tissue or rather cells 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 tangible fabric are also divided by 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 form on a cylindrical epithelium flat 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
 epithelium cubic loops and so on 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.719
 means the next fabric we want 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.600
 talk this muscle tissue there are three 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.850
 type of muscle tissue 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.119
 smooth muscle tissue 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 striated a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.930
 skeletal muscle tissue and 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 striated cardiac muscular 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.819
 muscle tissue cells are called 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.489
 myocytes they have common properties 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.709
 this excitability is conductivity and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.499
 airway they are all capable of conducting 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.599
 nervous excitement and shrink under 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:27.790
 its effects smooth muscle tissue 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.849
 makes up shooting of internal organs and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.310
 the walls of blood vessels and its function 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.810
 these are various peristaltic movements 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.969
 for example peristalsis 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.519
 gastrointestinal contraction 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:47.200
 contraction of the uterus muscles during childbirth and so 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.409
 further cells smooth muscle tissue 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.969
 has a spindle shape and they 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.930
 are 1 nuclear cells 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.389
 striated skeletal tissue 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 composed of multicore cells 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.560
 enough long fibers 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.359
 inside which contains the active thread 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.349
 myosins which allow these cells 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:11.139
 shrink skeletal transverse 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.379
 striped tissue forms skeletal muscle 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.659
 human and functions first 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.389
 movement in the second defense of internal 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.400
 next tissue damage from organs 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.389
 it 's striated cardio 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.859
 its feature is that cells or 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.689
 irregularly shaped as well 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.430
 multinuclear have cross striped 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.400
 striation consist of active 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.129
 myosin but inside the cells exists 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.680
 some cytoplasmic bridge which 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.900
 and form such a tricky plexus 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.159
 cross stripe feature 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.409
 heart tissue 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.659
 this machine they are able to shrink 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.959
 under the influence of a nerve impulse which 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:56.790
 originated in them walks composition 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.030
 myocardial cardiac muscle muscles 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.430
 the following tissue is connective tissue 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.379
 the most diverse body tissue 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.349
 human mostly cells 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.259
 connective tissue perform some kind of 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.269
 auxiliary function connective 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:18.940
 the fabric is solid liquid jelly 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:25.000
 hardness connective tissue forms 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.350
 bone forms ligament and fascia function 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.870
 her first and 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:36.160
 poro protection and movement 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.900
 the next connective tissue is 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.570
 cartilaginous cartilaginous refers to 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.330
 jelly tissue cartilage and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.610
 form intervertebral articular cartilage 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.050
 drives and first and foremost she 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.020
 facilitates the movement of bones in the joints 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.520
 the next tissue is fatty tissue 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.530
 makes up this fatty tissue refers to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.340
 connective tissue major function 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.140
 this is thermoregulation of liquid tissue 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.080
 body is blood and lymph 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.880
 features of blood and lymph functions 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.930
 is to transport nutrient 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.220
 transport substances 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.690
 oxygen and transport of hormones than 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.690
 is another regulatory function 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.380
 blood and the lymphatic system is in 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.520
 the first place 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.310
 immune protection nerve tissue consists of 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.060
 cells called neurons 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.860
 neurons are basic functional 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.410
 structural unit of nervous tissue they 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 form the brain-spinal nerves and 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.900
 nerve nodes function of nerve tissue 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.390
 it is primarily this connection between 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.490
 organs and organ systems 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.460
 inside the body, that is, it will bind 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.560
 the organism as a whole even with 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.450
 using nervous tissue carried 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.610
 interaction of the organism with the surrounding 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.860
 by medium 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.620
 in this way the human tissues entering 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.940
 the composition of the internal organs provides 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.210
 well-coordinated work of the whole body 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.760
 human it is we finish our occupation
