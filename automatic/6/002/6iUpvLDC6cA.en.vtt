 now in a moment I should tell you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 when I was in high school and when I told 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 my parents that they had when I could not 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.800
 He met with my friend to live in Murcia 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
 but no no no no that's not a stage 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 very happy to that I do not tell it just 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.039

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:36.070
 thanks for the sound effects of nothing 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:39.070
 what's up lately I love the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 following 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.160
 I'm obviously talking about 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.050
 some general names and 6 please 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.850
 what am I talking about since the humor 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.330
 Well, people with a tumor are not going to do it 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.500
 grace of such humor mood with h seems 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.970
 that we can not talk about anything 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.470
 of the death of people who suffer is spoken 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.940
 of God there are people who suffer if you talk about 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.920
 toasters of people who start with a 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.270
 toaster murdered his entire family to the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.490
 view is that we can not please 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.770
 all the world 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.510
 and I do not mean sexually the case that 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.920
 They are sensitive and eye that I do not say 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.270
 I'm not sensitive like all the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 humans we have a little sensitivity 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.860
 in the future fund that takes out 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 absolutely all of you have cried in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 some movie or series to the most 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 hard there has been a time when 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.460
 I live something and have cried because it has 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.110
 excited everyone 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.369
 it's like watching the chapter when rachel 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.780
 He goes to Paris and says goodbye to all his 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.420
 friends and I am divided the chapter 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.700
 crying like a slut cupcake and says 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.440
 because I'm seeing this that I'm 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.509
 going wrong because I'm having a hard time 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.950
 and I'm seeing it because I want is that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.020
 having a hard time like that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.850
 for free we are going to follow us 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.080
 I like to have a bad time, for example, I 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.480
 for lemon since all they want is 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.460
 is to make you cry that they are so romantic 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.200
 but of course it is a matter of taste the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.000
 likes define us as people sometimes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.470
 even as murderers because we all 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.970
 has happened to be with people and that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.670
 someone mention your favorite movies 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 and a partner that you liked 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.350
 since you know him he never attacks and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.750
 normal and that partner says that movie 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.470
 it's crap that's horrible and you 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.470
 you look with every time 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.680
 I just swallowed someone's soul and 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.469
 is a friend can you put when you kill that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.180
 yes always always respecting your tastes 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:24.330
 because you have to know how to respect 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.390
 I said yes but good also what is 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.620
 the illegality mom mom what do you think of the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.379
 justice in spain 'fast as fast 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 are mothers we have towards my mother 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.569
 for example you have a towel in the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 bathroom in which you can not 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.660
 clean because it gets dirty and where 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.920
 you can get dirty are in place 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.569
 less in view that are the ones we use 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.250
 Normally but that towel you can not 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.250
 clean in it because it is white and dirty 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.440
 so shock tell me the comments and 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.600
 your mother also does things that are not 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 they make sense or is my mother the only one 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.070
 I think he did not put all that he was 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.550
 talking in the beginning video the 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.590
 romay la fl 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.170
 I did not do an August 23 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.610
 my mother screamed screaming because of the heat 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.280
 for the pain because but not comfortable 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.140
 you will tell me if it is not hot and nothing 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.090
 say of a institute really a little while 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.630
 because I liked always had stopping 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.630
 I was running 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.790
 to lamb and when I used it this channel 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.739
 to complain I made videos complaining 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.720
 but it makes things more than one year 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.129
 Well it 's about time I complained 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 again I have not complained for a long time 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.330
 not only does it mean that you take the video 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.010
 positively I'm not saying anything 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.530
 bad simply because sometimes there are things 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.150
 of youtube that I say and I wanted 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.730
 say it here with you like that in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.349
 trust but without malice to none 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.500
 I want to believe that people have my video 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.450
 your very mind is people with criteria that 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.879
 You know what you're seeing, call me weird 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.840
 innocent does not remember a thumb if you 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.760
 you liked it and if you did not like it 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.140
 forgive me for wasting my time 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.849
 see you in the next video and I've 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.720
 hurt when he put my finger in 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.720
 true goodbye
