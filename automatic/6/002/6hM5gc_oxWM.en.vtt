00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
so if enemies are nearby you just shoot

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.919 
so if enemies are nearby you just shoot
the<00:02:05.190> barrels<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.729> everything<00:02:06.030> explodes<00:02:06.630> in

shooting trying to stay alive but what I
didn't<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.350> fact<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.800> usually

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
didn't like is the fact that usually

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.380 
didn't like is the fact that usually
these<00:04:50.910> enemies<00:04:51.330> spawn<00:04:51.750> at<00:04:51.960> certain<00:04:52.290> points<00:04:52.830> in

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.110 
these enemies spawn at certain points in
the<00:04:54.390> low<00:04:54.510> level<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.490> it<00:04:56.550> sort<00:04:56.730> of<00:04:56.760> feels<00:04:56.970> like

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
the low level so it sort of feels like

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.570 
the low level so it sort of feels like
