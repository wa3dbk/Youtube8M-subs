00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
all right so here we are we're in Portal

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.320 
all right so here we are we're in Portal
2<00:00:04.680> VR<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.580> can<00:00:05.700> see<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.120> can<00:00:06.150> look

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
2 VR and you can see that we can look

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.970 
2 VR and you can see that we can look
around<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:07.109> virtual<00:00:07.470> reality

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
around and in virtual reality

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.490 
around and in virtual reality
and<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.309> using<00:00:08.790> kind<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.059> natural<00:00:09.500> head

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and just using kind of a natural head

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400 
and just using kind of a natural head
movement<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.540> now<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.840> we've<00:00:12.990> added<00:00:13.170> is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
movement and now what we've added is

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.770 
movement and now what we've added is
your<00:00:13.710> own<00:00:13.830> personal<00:00:14.490> habit<00:00:15.000> our<00:00:15.150> hair<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.599> now

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
your own personal habit our hair so now

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.630 
your own personal habit our hair so now
we're<00:00:15.929> Chell<00:00:16.139> inside<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> portal<00:00:16.920> 2<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
we're Chell inside of portal 2 and I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400 
we're Chell inside of portal 2 and I
have<00:00:17.789> hands<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.570> portal<00:00:18.960> gun<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> can

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
have hands and a portal gun that I can

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.260 
have hands and a portal gun that I can
manipulate<00:00:19.730> with<00:00:20.730> six<00:00:20.910> degrees<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.150> freedom

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
manipulate with six degrees of freedom

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.740 
manipulate with six degrees of freedom
so<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.550> navigate<00:00:23.640> using<00:00:24.090> traditional

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so I can navigate using traditional

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
so I can navigate using traditional
controls<00:00:25.050> using<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> joystick<00:00:25.619> over<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
controls using the joystick over here I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849 
controls using the joystick over here I
can<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.000> turn<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.869> body<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:28.560> turn<00:00:28.680> my

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
can also turn my body and I will turn my

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.479 
can also turn my body and I will turn my
forward<00:00:29.160> direction<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
forward direction as well so with the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.530 
forward direction as well so with the
extra<00:00:34.550> range<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.670> motion<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.239> with

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
extra range of motion that you have with

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.880 
extra range of motion that you have with
adding<00:00:36.960> motion<00:00:37.260> controls<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
adding motion controls here and now I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.250 
adding motion controls here and now I
can<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:38.850> shoulder

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
can just kind of look over my shoulder

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
can just kind of look over my shoulder
fire<00:00:40.260> portals<00:00:41.090> without<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.239> thinking

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
fire portals without really thinking

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.869 
fire portals without really thinking
about<00:00:43.040> what<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:44.610> not

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
about what I'm going to do I'm not

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
about what I'm going to do I'm not
thinking<00:00:45.210> about<00:00:45.270> input<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.840> much<00:00:45.960> anymore<00:00:46.200> as

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
thinking about input so much anymore as

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
thinking about input so much anymore as
I<00:00:46.530> am<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> naturally<00:00:47.879> doing<00:00:48.180> what

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I am just kind of naturally doing what

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
I am just kind of naturally doing what
feels<00:00:49.070> intuitive<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> am<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
feels intuitive so here I am this is a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830 
feels intuitive so here I am this is a
feature<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.280> we've<00:00:53.430> added<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> portal<00:00:54.000> 2<00:00:54.120> we

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
feature that we've added to portal 2 we

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
feature that we've added to portal 2 we
call<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.050> one-to-one<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> am

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
call this one-to-one where I am

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
call this one-to-one where I am
manipulating<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.660> cube<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
manipulating this cube with the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.110 
manipulating this cube with the
orientation<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> controller<00:00:59.789> which

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
orientation of the controller which

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
orientation of the controller which
affects<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> object's<00:01:00.960> orientation<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.649> mean

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
affects the object's orientation I mean

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
affects the object's orientation I mean
the<00:01:01.980> position<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> controller<00:01:03.270> which

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the position of the controller which

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
the position of the controller which
affects<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> position<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> we've

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
affects of that position so that we've

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520 
affects of that position so that we've
built<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> bunch<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> puzzles<00:01:06.780> around<00:01:07.260> just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
built a bunch of puzzles around just

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880 
built a bunch of puzzles around just
this<00:01:07.770> mechanical<00:01:08.220> loan<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:10.140> simple<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.770> is

this mechanical loan a simple one is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
this mechanical loan a simple one is
just<00:01:11.070> reaching<00:01:11.490> across<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> gap<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> dropping

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
just reaching across a gap and dropping

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.670 
just reaching across a gap and dropping
it<00:01:13.560> onto<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:14.130> button<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.470> get<00:01:16.470> across

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it onto a button so you can get across

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
it onto a button so you can get across
this<00:01:16.830> bridge<00:01:19.340> another<00:01:20.420> fun<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this bridge another fun thing to do

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.440 
this bridge another fun thing to do
inside<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> virtual<00:01:22.409> reality<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.330> it's<00:01:24.330> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
inside the virtual reality is it's just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
inside the virtual reality is it's just
I<00:01:24.720> mean<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> simple<00:01:25.380> act<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> falling<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I mean just a simple act of falling I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.630 
I mean just a simple act of falling I
mean<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.549> feel<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.259> you're<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:29.280> here

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
mean you really feel like you're in here

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
mean you really feel like you're in here
in<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.060> world<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.960> falling

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
in this world and so when you're falling

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
in this world and so when you're falling
you<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.159> same<00:01:32.430> sensations<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you get this in same sensations as you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
you get this in same sensations as you
are<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.509> falling<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> again<00:01:37.770> since<00:01:37.979> we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
are really falling so again since we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.990 
are really falling so again since we
don't<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.310> any<00:01:38.430> line-of-sight

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
don't have any line-of-sight

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.710 
don't have any line-of-sight
requirements<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:42.180> fantastic

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
requirements it's really a fantastic

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
requirements it's really a fantastic
experience<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.500> terms<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.890> light<00:01:44.009> calibration

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
experience in terms of light calibration

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.319 
experience in terms of light calibration
I<00:01:44.549> could<00:01:44.640> again<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.030> turn<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> way

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
I could again I can turn all the way

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
I could again I can turn all the way
around<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.470> nothing<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> interfere

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
around and nothing is going to interfere

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
around and nothing is going to interfere
with<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.350> input<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> controller<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.130> all

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
with the input of the controller at all

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
with the input of the controller at all
we<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.990> things

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
we can kind of do some little things

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740 
we can kind of do some little things
like<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.170 

and<00:01:56.500> then<00:01:57.430> we're<00:01:57.579> going<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.759> be<00:01:57.820> adding<00:01:58.060> more

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
and then we're going to be adding more

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.670 
and then we're going to be adding more
interactions<00:01:58.780> where<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.320> can<00:01:59.409> just<00:01:59.530> reach

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
interactions where you can just reach

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.969 
interactions where you can just reach
out<00:02:00.810> press<00:02:01.810> buttons<00:02:02.140> kind<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.439> intuitive<00:02:02.890> you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
out press buttons kind of intuitive you

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.440 
out press buttons kind of intuitive you
can<00:02:03.100> imagine<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.520> other<00:02:03.909> games<00:02:04.180> where<00:02:04.360> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
can imagine a other games where you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.819 
can imagine a other games where you
would<00:02:04.570> maybe<00:02:04.869> be<00:02:04.990> that's<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.289> light<00:02:05.439> switch<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
would maybe be that's a light switch you

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.560 
would maybe be that's a light switch you
just<00:02:05.979> need<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> open<00:02:06.310> each<00:02:06.399> over<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> flip<00:02:07.450> on

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
just need to open each over and flip on

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.330 
just need to open each over and flip on
a<00:02:07.600> light<00:02:07.679> we're<00:02:08.679> typically<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.039> might<00:02:09.130> get<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
a light we're typically you might get a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.040 
a light we're typically you might get a
button<00:02:09.580> problems<00:02:09.910> okay<00:02:10.090> press<00:02:10.360> B<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.720> turn<00:02:10.959> on

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
button problems okay press B to turn on

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.240 
button problems okay press B to turn on
the<00:02:11.110> light<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:11.590> now<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.739> can<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.040> reach<00:02:12.130> out

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the light but now you can just reach out

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
the light but now you can just reach out
and<00:02:12.400> kind<00:02:12.519> of<00:02:12.550> do<00:02:12.700> what's<00:02:12.849> intuitive<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.360> just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and kind of do what's intuitive and just

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.530 
and kind of do what's intuitive and just
flip<00:02:13.780> switch<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> again<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.360> type<00:02:16.510> of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
flip switch so again with this type of

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.410 
flip switch so again with this type of
precision<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.440> reach<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.420> really

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
precision you can reach out and really

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
precision you can reach out and really
direct<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.140> way<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.560> write<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> exactly<00:02:21.220> where

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
direct a way to write it exactly where

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.699 
direct a way to write it exactly where
you<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.620> a

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
you want it so this is a you know a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.440 
you want it so this is a you know a
typical<00:02:26.890> item<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.849> portal<00:02:28.090> T<00:02:28.150> universe

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
typical item in the portal T universe

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.960 
typical item in the portal T universe
this<00:02:28.599> lens<00:02:28.780> root<00:02:28.930> cube<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:29.709> you're<00:02:30.280> you're

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
this lens root cube but you're you're

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.000 
this lens root cube but you're you're
bound<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.390> its<00:02:31.510> axes<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:32.019> pretty<00:02:32.200> much<00:02:32.319> like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
bound to its axes are pretty much like

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.009 
bound to its axes are pretty much like
this<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.940> know<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.150> turn<00:02:34.450> your<00:02:34.630> body<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
this you know you can turn your body and

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.870 
this you know you can turn your body and
name<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> delays<00:02:35.650> ur<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.280> now<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.459> get<00:02:36.640> full

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
name the delays ur so now you get full

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.979 
name the delays ur so now you get full
six<00:02:37.090> degrees<00:02:37.299> of<00:02:37.390> freedom<00:02:37.630> pretty<00:02:38.230> neat<00:02:39.989> one

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
six degrees of freedom pretty neat one

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.630 
six degrees of freedom pretty neat one
thing<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.200> guess<00:02:41.380> needs<00:02:41.799> since<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.400> have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
thing I guess needs since I can I have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.729 
thing I guess needs since I can I have
this<00:02:42.819> range<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.540> let<00:02:44.019> go<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.470> this

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
this range I can just let go of this

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.069 
this range I can just let go of this
object<00:02:44.950> mid<00:02:45.579> mid<00:02:45.910> swing<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.780> actually<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.049> can

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
object mid mid swing and actually I can

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.660 
object mid mid swing and actually I can
throw<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.470> object

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.460 

and<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:57.180> another<00:02:57.690> feature<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.170> added<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and then another feature we added to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.520 
and then another feature we added to
portal<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.210> a<00:03:00.210> concept<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.050> what<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.380> call

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
portal is a concept of what we call

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.000 
portal is a concept of what we call
portal<00:03:01.860> surfing<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:03.320> basically<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.620> portal

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
portal surfing and basically in portal

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.050 
portal surfing and basically in portal
if<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.160> fire<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> portal<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.000> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
if you fire a portal there and it's in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.100 
if you fire a portal there and it's in
the<00:03:06.120> wrong<00:03:06.240> spot<00:03:06.300> from<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.930> wrong

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the wrong spot from the wrong

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.110 
the wrong spot from the wrong
orientation<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.950> refire<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.970> just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
orientation you have to refire you just

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510 
orientation you have to refire you just
kind<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.300> get<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.600> right<00:03:09.690> spot<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.520> like

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
kind of get it in the right spot so like

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.830 
kind of get it in the right spot so like
here<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:11.910> at<00:03:12.000> an<00:03:12.180> angle<00:03:12.360> might<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
here if it's at an angle might be the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.449 
here if it's at an angle might be the
wrong<00:03:12.990> angle<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.100> well<00:03:14.280> now<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
wrong angle so you do that well now you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.250 
wrong angle so you do that well now you
can<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.730> reach<00:03:14.850> out<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.060> grab<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.080> can

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
can just reach out and grab it you can

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.880 
can just reach out and grab it you can
rotate<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:20.360> all<00:03:21.360> right<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.470> reason<00:03:22.590> we

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
rotate it all right so the reason we

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.070 
rotate it all right so the reason we
call<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.070> portal<00:03:23.400> surfing<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.660> because<00:03:24.930> we

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
call it portal surfing it's because we

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.100 
call it portal surfing it's because we
can<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.670> get<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.790> here<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.870> feel<00:03:28.020> like

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
can actually get in here and feel like

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.780 
can actually get in here and feel like
you're<00:03:28.260> kind<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.470> surfing<00:03:28.800> around

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.220 

all<00:03:35.480> right<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.750> have<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.900> couple<00:03:36.110> other

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
all right we have a couple other

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.810 
all right we have a couple other
features<00:03:36.590> too<00:03:36.770> that<00:03:36.950> we're<00:03:37.100> not<00:03:37.220> showing<00:03:37.400> here

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
features too that we're not showing here

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.280 
features too that we're not showing here
one<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.240> have<00:03:38.360> it's<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.600> scaling<00:03:38.960> feature<00:03:39.080> we

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
one we have it's a scaling feature we

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
one we have it's a scaling feature we
can<00:03:39.680> reach<00:03:39.830> out<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.280> can<00:03:40.400> grab<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.580> cube

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
can reach out and you can grab a cube

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.000 
can reach out and you can grab a cube
and<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> can<00:03:41.270> change<00:03:41.600> its<00:03:41.810> size<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.890> then

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
and you can change its size and then

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.890 
and you can change its size and then
you're<00:03:43.130> delayed<00:03:43.340> how<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.750> could

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you're delayed how so you could

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.420 
you're delayed how so you could
basically<00:03:45.110> mentally<00:03:45.800> have<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> button<00:03:46.220> here

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
basically mentally have a button here

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.400 
basically mentally have a button here
and<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.580> button<00:03:46.850> here<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.690> could<00:03:47.840> put<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.200> cube

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
and a button here you could put the cube

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.900 
and a button here you could put the cube
on<00:03:48.530> both<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:51.380> again<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.740> is<00:03:51.890> just<00:03:52.040> super

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
on both so again this is just super

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.150 
on both so again this is just super
immersive<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.570> when<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.590> look<00:03:54.709> down<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.010> see

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
immersive and when you look down and see

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.920 
immersive and when you look down and see
yourself<00:03:55.520> in<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.730> world<00:03:55.910> it's<00:03:56.240> it's<00:03:56.690> very

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.990 
yourself in the world it's it's very
compelling<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.560> now<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.580> you've<00:03:58.700> had<00:03:58.850> all

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
this movement you just you know it's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.080 
this movement you just you know it's
just<00:04:00.890> gonna<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:01.490> better<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.700> better<00:04:01.910> at<00:04:02.060> this

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.850 

yeah<00:04:09.950> right<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.520> um<00:04:10.880> we're<00:04:11.300> showing<00:04:11.450> two

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
yeah right so um we're showing two

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.229 
yeah right so um we're showing two
controllers<00:04:12.860> here<00:04:13.100> one<00:04:13.640> for<00:04:13.760> each<00:04:13.820> hand<00:04:14.030> but

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
controllers here one for each hand but

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.539 
controllers here one for each hand but
we<00:04:14.870> also<00:04:14.989> added<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.380> third<00:04:15.890> tracker<00:04:16.190> for<00:04:16.430> your

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
we also added a third tracker for your

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.729 
we also added a third tracker for your
head<00:04:16.700> now<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.660> reason<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.200> added<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.620> is

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
head now the reason we added this is

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.190 
head now the reason we added this is
because<00:04:19.010> now<00:04:19.310> we<00:04:19.850> have<00:04:20.000> position<00:04:20.840> tracking<00:04:21.019> on

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
because now we have position tracking on

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.080 
because now we have position tracking on
the<00:04:21.290> head<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.340> if<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.490> kind<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.760> use<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:22.940> frame

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
the head so if I kind of use this frame

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.220 
the head so if I kind of use this frame
of<00:04:23.210> reference<00:04:23.450> here<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.660> can<00:04:23.750> see<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.020> now

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
of reference here you can see that now

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.950 
of reference here you can see that now
if<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:24.500> lean<00:04:25.030> right<00:04:26.030> I'm<00:04:26.450> giving<00:04:26.690> some<00:04:26.840> head

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
if I lean right I'm giving some head

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.600 
if I lean right I'm giving some head
movements<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.660> crouch<00:04:30.430> alright<00:04:31.430> so

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
movements and I can crouch alright so

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.390 
movements and I can crouch alright so
just<00:04:31.640> kind<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:31.940> naturally<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.390> things<00:04:33.400> in

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
just kind of naturally you things in

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.580 
just kind of naturally you things in
game<00:04:34.610> as<00:04:35.480> you<00:04:35.660> would<00:04:35.810> in<00:04:35.930> real<00:04:36.080> life<00:04:36.290> and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
game as you would in real life and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.469 
game as you would in real life and
they're<00:04:37.070> get<00:04:37.669> translated<00:04:38.120> right<00:04:38.240> into<00:04:38.390> the

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
they're get translated right into the

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.960 
they're get translated right into the
virtual<00:04:38.600> world
