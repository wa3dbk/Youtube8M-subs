needs to be very tall and thick I need

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620 
needs to be very tall and thick I need
to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.660> bit<00:01:57.810> thick<00:01:58.170> than<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:59.630> very

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to do it a bit thick than that very

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
to do it a bit thick than that very
thicker<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.560> means<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.830> be<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> ball<00:02:04.640> yes

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
thicker it means to be like a ball yes
sir<00:02:07.790> we'll<00:02:08.960> just<00:02:09.960> make<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.920> lot<00:02:11.100> thicker

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
sir we'll just make it a lot thicker

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.030 
sir we'll just make it a lot thicker
exist<00:02:12.150> too<00:02:12.660> thin<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:15.260> they<00:02:16.260> round<00:02:16.650> shape<00:02:19.040> could

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
exist too thin so they round shape could

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:30.540 
exist too thin so they round shape could
put<00:02:20.310> some<00:02:20.490> more<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.850> bottom<00:02:24.050> yeah<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> needs

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.580 

yeah<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.870> bottom<00:02:33.930> needs<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
yeah I'm on the bottom needs to be I

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.510 
yeah I'm on the bottom needs to be I
think<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.400> bit<00:02:36.550> more<00:02:36.730> along

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.870 

it<00:02:43.520> needs<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> be<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.270> lot<00:02:44.570> more<00:02:44.600> along<00:02:45.880> probably

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
it needs to be a lot more along probably

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.400 
it needs to be a lot more along probably
just<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.210> more<00:02:47.360> layer<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.990> make<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.170> look<00:02:48.350> like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
just one more layer to make it look like

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:58.630 
just one more layer to make it look like
a<00:02:48.560> ball<00:02:49.930> that'll<00:02:50.930> do<00:02:53.230> yep<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.190> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
a ball that'll do yep so this is the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.000 
a ball that'll do yep so this is the
final<00:02:59.180> result<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.990> think<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:00.620> pretty<00:03:00.830> awesome

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
final result I think it's pretty awesome
