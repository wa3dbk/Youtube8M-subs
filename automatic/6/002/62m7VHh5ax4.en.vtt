here's a bit of a translucent copy on

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.199 
here's a bit of a translucent copy on
mirrors<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:56.200> if<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.700> put<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.060> this

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
mirrors but if you if you put it in this

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.140 
mirrors but if you if you put it in this
pocket<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:59.130> the<00:03:00.130> more<00:03:00.370> insight<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
pocket because the more insight of the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
hands are a bit rate so if you get a bit

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.080 
hands are a bit rate so if you get a bit
of<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.700> purple<00:03:04.120> color<00:03:04.770> right<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.160> here<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.910> is
