00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
know some people do this is squeeze and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.180 
know some people do this is squeeze and
pull<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.309> twist<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.520> before<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
pull don't I twist it before I do it I

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
pull don't I twist it before I do it I
figure<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.870> gives<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> better

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
figure or for me it gives me a better

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.490 
figure or for me it gives me a better
result<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.730> see<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.690> nice<00:01:00.989> curl

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
result as you can see it's a nice curl

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.399 
result as you can see it's a nice curl
pattern<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.870> people<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
pattern but different people do it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
pattern but different people do it
differently<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> how

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
differently and I just think this is how

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
differently and I just think this is how
it<00:01:07.260> works<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.680> me<00:01:07.799> especially<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:09.330> hair

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it works for me especially my hair

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.250 
it works for me especially my hair
texture<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.540> unraveling<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.900> basically

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
texture so unraveling it I basically

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.980 
texture so unraveling it I basically
twists<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> opposite<00:01:15.000> direction<00:01:15.710> then<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
twists at the opposite direction then I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.580 
twists at the opposite direction then I
carefully<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.369> twist<00:01:21.049> so<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.320> got

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
carefully take out the twist so I've got

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.789 
carefully take out the twist so I've got
end<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.490> process<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.409> my<00:01:25.590> hair

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
end of this process this is how my hair

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.539 
end of this process this is how my hair
looks<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.270> bad<00:01:27.799> actually<00:01:28.799> kinda

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
looks it's not that bad actually kinda

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.020 
looks it's not that bad actually kinda
is<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.079> take<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.560> outside<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
is so I can just take this outside so to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.260 
is so I can just take this outside so to
give<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> fuller<00:01:34.579> look<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.150> give

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
give it like a fuller look and to give

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
give it like a fuller look and to give
it<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.509> volume<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:38.060> part<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:40.020> sections<00:01:40.770> into

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it more volume I part the sections into

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
it more volume I part the sections into
smaller<00:01:41.610> sections<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.950> think

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
smaller sections I don't think

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.300 
smaller sections I don't think
everything<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:45.030> dry<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.630> wait<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
everything was dry but wait I was in a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.760 
everything was dry but wait I was in a
hurry<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.600> used<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> leave<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.500> think<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
hurry and I'm used to leave I think I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.889 
hurry and I'm used to leave I think I
had<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> work<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.460> something<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> yeah

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
had to work or something but yeah

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200 
had to work or something but yeah
instead<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> parting<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> seeing<00:01:53.850> okay

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
instead of parting it and seeing okay

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.280 
instead of parting it and seeing okay
like<00:01:54.420> let's<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.259> works<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.120 
the look
you<00:02:13.050> mean<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:14.420> honestly<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:16.110> did<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.920> bunt

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
you mean I honestly just did the bunt

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.340 
you mean I honestly just did the bunt
amounts<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> back<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.690> was<00:02:18.990> tired

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
amounts on the back because I was tired

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.850 
amounts on the back because I was tired
and<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.800> being<00:02:22.800> lazy<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.630> figured<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
and I was being lazy so I just figured I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.960 
and I was being lazy so I just figured I
could<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> month<00:02:26.370> announced<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> back

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
could do the month announced on the back

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.110 
could do the month announced on the back
but<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.990> bunt<00:02:28.200> or<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.530> gives<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.400> think<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
but the bunt or not gives it I think a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.530 
but the bunt or not gives it I think a
more<00:02:30.300> defined<00:02:30.810> curl<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.010> perm<00:02:32.280> rods<00:02:32.550> it

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
more defined curl and the perm rods it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.350 
more defined curl and the perm rods it
makes<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> bit<00:02:34.050> fuller<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.270> depending<00:02:36.270> on

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
makes it a bit fuller so depending on

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.940 
makes it a bit fuller so depending on
what<00:02:36.480> you're<00:02:36.600> looking<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.320> do

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
what you're looking for you can do

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.700 
what you're looking for you can do
either<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.570> both<00:02:39.780> as<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.350> did<00:02:40.560> it

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
either or or you can do both as I did it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.090 
either or or you can do both as I did it
so<00:02:41.490> for<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.420> finished<00:02:42.810> look<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.350> didn't<00:02:43.980> want

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
so for the finished look I didn't want

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
so for the finished look I didn't want
to<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.310> leave<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.820> or<00:02:45.030> take<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.420> out<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to just leave it or take it out as I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.680 
to just leave it or take it out as I
