00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the more you play if you start getting

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
the more you play if you start getting
black<00:00:31.679> stuff<00:00:32.009> left<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.460> fingers<00:00:32.790> that's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
black stuff left on your fingers that's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
black stuff left on your fingers that's
actually<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> oil<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.469> grease<00:00:34.590> buildup<00:00:34.980> from

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
actually the oil and grease buildup from

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually the oil and grease buildup from
your<00:00:35.820> fingers<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> mean<00:00:36.960> our

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
your fingers because you know I mean our

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
your fingers because you know I mean our
skin<00:00:37.590> admits<00:00:37.920> oils<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> salt<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
skin admits oils and salt and all that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.180 
skin admits oils and salt and all that
stuff<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:41.000> builds<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.090> after<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.629> long

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
stuff in it just builds up after so long

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
stuff in it just builds up after so long
so<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> does<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.539> takes<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.840> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so what this does is it takes all that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830 
so what this does is it takes all that
stuff<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> strings<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.300> believe<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.570> says

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
stuff off the strings I believe it says

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
stuff off the strings I believe it says
you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.110> play<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.350> spray<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> directly<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you can play it spray it directly on the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
you can play it spray it directly on the
guitar<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.390> never<00:00:52.079> spray<00:00:52.379> anything<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
guitar I never spray anything on the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
guitar I never spray anything on the
guitar<00:00:53.250> even<00:00:53.399> cleaners<00:00:53.910> I'd<00:00:54.059> rather<00:00:54.480> split<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
guitar even cleaners I'd rather split it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.040 
guitar even cleaners I'd rather split it
on<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> rag<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:56.190> clean<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> guitar<00:00:57.050> so

on the rag and then clean the guitar so
just<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.649> safe<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.940> stuff<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
guitar neck down um I think they say to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.830 
guitar neck down um I think they say to
use<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.829> on<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> back<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.329> kind<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.690> like

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
use it on the back but I kind of like

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.650 
use it on the back but I kind of like
more<00:03:50.079> like<00:03:50.139> a<00:03:50.290> grippy<00:03:51.060> feel<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.299> not<00:03:52.599> a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
more like a grippy feel that not a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.259 
more like a grippy feel that not a
lacquered<00:03:53.139> feel<00:03:53.380> but<00:03:53.709> just<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.880> don't

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
lacquered feel but just like the I don't

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.550 
lacquered feel but just like the I don't
know<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.359> get<00:03:55.599> it's<00:03:55.720> probably<00:03:55.989> from<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.170> oils

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
know I get it's probably from the oils

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.289 
know I get it's probably from the oils
from<00:03:56.590> my<00:03:56.799> hands<00:03:57.190> but<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.849> just<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> way<00:03:58.239> it

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
from my hands but I just like the way it

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.699 
from my hands but I just like the way it
feels<00:03:58.510> on<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.810> back<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.200> neck<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.530> don't

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
feels on the back of the neck so I don't

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.800
