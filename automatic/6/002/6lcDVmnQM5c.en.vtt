you<00:02:10.470> already<00:02:10.590> saw<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.250> add<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> minutes

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you already saw you can add the minutes

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.170 
you already saw you can add the minutes
on<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.270> such<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.610> know<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
on that as such then you know that's the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.490 
on that as such then you know that's the
color<00:02:15.450> again<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.980> complications

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
color again and then the complications

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.680 
color again and then the complications
next<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.740> is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
next up is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.630 
next up is
motion<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.650> kind<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.040> cool<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.550> get

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
motion is kind of cool because you get

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
motion is kind of cool because you get
to<00:02:22.700> pick<00:02:23.360> something<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.810> move<00:02:23.960> around<00:02:24.080> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
to pick something to move around and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.020 
to pick something to move around and
there's<00:02:24.830> three<00:02:24.980> options<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.520> jellyfish

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
there's three options the jellyfish

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.620 
there's three options the jellyfish
flower<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.130> butterfly<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.460> every<00:02:29.210> time<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
flower and butterfly and every time the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.170 
flower and butterfly and every time the
display<00:02:30.110> turns<00:02:30.410> off<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.400> look<00:02:31.910> at<00:02:32.090> it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
display turns off and you you look at it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.970 
display turns off and you you look at it
again<00:02:32.420> there's<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> different<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.710> so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
again there's a different one there so

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.200 
again there's a different one there so
it's<00:02:34.130> pretty<00:02:34.250> cool<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:34.790> wait<00:02:34.910> for<00:02:35.090> this

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
it's pretty cool so if we wait for this

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.710 
it's pretty cool so if we wait for this
to<00:02:35.510> turn<00:02:35.990> off<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:38.060> we<00:02:38.240> bring<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.540> back

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
to turn off here and we bring it back

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
to turn off here and we bring it back
you<00:02:39.050> see<00:02:39.380> there's<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.710> different<00:02:40.220> jellyfish

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you see there's a different jellyfish

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600 
you see there's a different jellyfish
this<00:02:41.030> time<00:02:41.620> now<00:02:42.620> let's<00:02:42.830> take<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> look<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
this time now let's take a look at the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.330 
this time now let's take a look at the
other<00:02:43.940> ones<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.990> yes<00:02:45.590> they<00:02:46.070> are

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
other ones so yes they are

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:55.450 
other ones so yes they are
so<00:02:47.150> here's<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.570> flower<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> there's<00:02:54.710> that<00:02:55.040> as

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
so here's the flower so there's that as

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:06.839 
so here's the flower so there's that as
well<00:02:56.360> as<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:58.660> butterfly

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.070 

and<00:03:07.849> as<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.299> see<00:03:08.360> when<00:03:08.659> we<00:03:08.690> bring<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
and as you can see when we bring the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.509 
and as you can see when we bring the
display<00:03:09.500> back<00:03:09.680> there's<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.069> different

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
display back there's a different

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.210 
display back there's a different
butterfly<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.739> jellyfish<00:03:13.190> is

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
butterfly I think the jellyfish is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.530 
butterfly I think the jellyfish is
pretty<00:03:13.610> cool<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.860> moving<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:17.000> next<00:03:17.239> one

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
pretty cool so moving on to the next one

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.539 
pretty cool so moving on to the next one
is<00:03:17.720> astronomy<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.769> is<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:18.980> really<00:03:19.340> cool

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
is astronomy now this is a really cool

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.570 
is astronomy now this is a really cool
watch<00:03:19.790> face<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.739> see<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.040> world<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
watch face you get to see the world and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.789 
watch face you get to see the world and
you<00:03:22.670> can<00:03:22.849> actually<00:03:23.299> change<00:03:24.019> where<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> clouds

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
you can actually change where the clouds

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.670 
you can actually change where the clouds
are<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.250> everything<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:27.140> Sun<00:03:27.409> moves

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
are and everything and the the Sun moves

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.839 
are and everything and the the Sun moves
around<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.129> can<00:03:28.250> see<00:03:28.370> where<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.640> night

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
around so you can see where it's night

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.770 
around so you can see where it's night
in<00:03:29.060> places<00:03:30.190> then<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.340> also<00:03:31.579> get<00:03:31.940> an<00:03:32.180> option<00:03:32.750> to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
in places then you also get an option to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.710 
in places then you also get an option to
see<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.860> moon<00:03:34.310> yes<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.269> moon<00:03:35.480> times

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
see the moon yes the moon times

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.119 
see the moon yes the moon times
happening<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.260> my<00:03:36.379> time<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.650> there<00:03:36.739> we<00:03:36.860> go

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
happening to my time so there we go

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.420 
happening to my time so there we go
so<00:03:37.579> there<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.209> moon<00:03:38.480> as<00:03:38.780> well<00:03:39.739> as<00:03:40.010> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
so there is the moon as well as the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.390 
so there is the moon as well as the
planets<00:03:41.090> all<00:03:41.420> in<00:03:41.870> orbit<00:03:42.680> around<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:43.069> Sun

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
planets all in orbit around the Sun

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.630 
planets all in orbit around the Sun
they're<00:03:44.170> moving<00:03:45.170> on<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.769> next<00:03:46.069> watch<00:03:46.340> face

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
they're moving on to the next watch face

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.240 
they're moving on to the next watch face
which<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.030> color<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:48.530> one<00:03:48.739> also<00:03:48.950> does

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
which is color this one also does

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.270 
which is color this one also does
heavily<00:03:49.760> focus<00:03:50.510> on<00:03:50.980> complications<00:03:51.980> but<00:03:52.159> as

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
heavily focus on complications but as

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.270 
heavily focus on complications but as
well<00:03:52.489> as<00:03:52.700> colors<00:03:53.090> thus<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.049> name<00:03:54.200> color<00:03:54.560> so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
well as colors thus the name color so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.849 
well as colors thus the name color so
you<00:03:55.340> can<00:03:55.670> change<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.269> around<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.560> then

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
you can change this around and then

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.949 
you can change this around and then
there's<00:03:58.069> this<00:03:58.310> screen<00:03:58.609> just<00:03:58.849> for

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
there's this screen just for

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.059 
there's this screen just for
complication<00:03:59.959> now<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.200> one<00:04:00.379> does<00:04:00.590> have<00:04:00.769> the

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
complication now this one does have the

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.809 
complication now this one does have the
monogram<00:04:01.940> on<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.260> which<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:03.769> basically<00:04:03.920> by

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
monogram on it which just basically by

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.520 
monogram on it which just basically by
default<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.359> your<00:04:05.510> initials<00:04:05.989> but<00:04:06.140> if<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.409> go

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
default it's your initials but if you go

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.110 
default it's your initials but if you go
into<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.799> Apple<00:04:07.069> watch<00:04:07.159> app<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.640> your<00:04:07.790> phone

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
into the Apple watch app on your phone

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.360 
into the Apple watch app on your phone
you<00:04:08.359> can<00:04:08.510> change<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.109> be<00:04:09.319> pretty<00:04:10.129> much

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
you can change that to be pretty much

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.449 
you can change that to be pretty much
whatever<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.880> want<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.500> moving<00:04:13.010> on<00:04:13.099> to<00:04:13.130> the

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
whatever you want so moving on to the

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.520 
whatever you want so moving on to the
next<00:04:13.669> watch<00:04:14.000> face<00:04:14.329> which<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:14.569> solar<00:04:15.079> now<00:04:15.319> this

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
next watch face which is solar now this

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.490 
next watch face which is solar now this
one<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:16.039> do<00:04:16.099> I<00:04:16.370> use<00:04:17.030> when<00:04:17.900> I'm<00:04:18.019> using<00:04:18.229> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
one I do I use when I'm using the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.190 
one I do I use when I'm using the
workout<00:04:19.280> app<00:04:19.489> on<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.849> Apple<00:04:20.209> watch<00:04:20.450> because

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
workout app on the Apple watch because

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.600 
workout app on the Apple watch because
when<00:04:21.380> I'm<00:04:21.470> outside<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.130> it's<00:04:22.310> kind<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
when I'm outside I think it's kind of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.520 
when I'm outside I think it's kind of
cool<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.030> switch<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.080> see<00:04:24.289> where<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
cool to switch to this and see where the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.640 
cool to switch to this and see where the
Sun<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.070> sky<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.760> stuff<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:27.289> you<00:04:27.530> can

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
Sun is in the sky and stuff and you can

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.800 
Sun is in the sky and stuff and you can
also<00:04:27.800> move<00:04:28.220> this<00:04:28.490> with<00:04:28.789> digital<00:04:29.270> crown<00:04:29.479> here

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
also move this with digital crown here

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.480 
also move this with digital crown here
so<00:04:30.050> if<00:04:30.169> we<00:04:30.260> wanted<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.560> put<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.860> either<00:04:31.039> at<00:04:31.430> a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
so if we wanted to put it either at a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.629 
so if we wanted to put it either at a
sunrise<00:04:32.210> or<00:04:32.960> sunset<00:04:33.260> or<00:04:33.950> something<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.490> can

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
sunrise or sunset or something you can

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.670 
sunrise or sunset or something you can
move<00:04:34.849> that<00:04:35.030> around<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.229> is<00:04:36.440> accurate

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
move that around and this is accurate

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.800 
move that around and this is accurate
for<00:04:36.979> where<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.460> are<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:38.000> what<00:04:38.360> time<00:04:38.599> it<00:04:38.750> is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
for where you are and what time it is

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.800 
for where you are and what time it is
and<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.229> moves<00:04:39.440> throughout<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.949> day<00:04:40.630> then<00:04:41.630> we

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
and it moves throughout the day then we

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.659 
and it moves throughout the day then we
have<00:04:42.080> cano<00:04:42.800> graph<00:04:43.870> now<00:04:44.870> this<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.349> is<00:04:46.190> kind<00:04:46.370> of

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
have cano graph now this one is kind of

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.089 
have cano graph now this one is kind of
interesting<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.449> actually<00:04:47.810> have<00:04:48.229> no<00:04:48.560> clue<00:04:48.590> what

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
interesting I actually have no clue what

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.510 
interesting I actually have no clue what
this<00:04:49.280> this<00:04:49.820> top<00:04:50.120> little<00:04:50.510> dial<00:04:50.780> here<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.199> for

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
this this top little dial here is for

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.250 
this this top little dial here is for
but<00:04:52.520> it's<00:04:52.669> really<00:04:52.910> made<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.090> be<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.750> look<00:04:53.930> more

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
but it's really made to be to look more

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.060 
but it's really made to be to look more
like<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> an<00:04:54.979> old<00:04:55.340> watch<00:04:55.729> so<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.199> can<00:04:57.410> move<00:04:57.830> all

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
like a an old watch so you can move all

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.100 
like a an old watch so you can move all
this<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:59.410> stuff<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.620> still<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:01.580> know<00:05:02.080> no<00:05:03.080> I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
think this is 60 seconds or something

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.110 
think this is 60 seconds or something
there<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.330> don't<00:05:05.510> know<00:05:05.599> this<00:05:06.760> now<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.970> just

and stuff like that and then you have
the<00:05:24.120> complications<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.200> course<00:05:26.270> so<00:05:27.270> moving<00:05:28.050> on

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
the complications of course so moving on

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.290 
the complications of course so moving on

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
just a large clock really the reason why

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.190 
just a large clock really the reason why
Apple<00:05:53.820> made<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.270> one<00:05:54.480> is<00:05:54.660> for<00:05:54.870> people<00:05:54.900> who

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
watch face and I did forget to mention

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.810 
watch face and I did forget to mention
that<00:06:13.530> there<00:06:13.830> are<00:06:13.860> some<00:06:14.310> watches<00:06:15.060> that<00:06:15.450> have<00:06:15.780> no

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
that there are some watches that have no

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.760 
that there are some watches that have no
complications<00:06:17.820> such<00:06:18.060> as<00:06:18.300> astronomy<00:06:19.260> and

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
complications such as astronomy and

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.300 
complications such as astronomy and
motion<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.870> that<00:06:21.900> is<00:06:22.290> all<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.770> watch<00:06:22.920> faces

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
motion and that is all the watch faces

on<00:06:23.910> Apple<00:06:24.660> watch<00:06:24.690> right<00:06:25.410> now<00:06:25.440> this<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:26.210> Apple

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
on Apple watch right now this is Apple

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.380 
on Apple watch right now this is Apple
watch<00:06:27.360> running<00:06:27.900> version<00:06:28.220> 1.00<00:06:29.220> I<00:06:29.550> do<00:06:29.760> imagine

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
watch running version 1.00 I do imagine

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.120 
watch running version 1.00 I do imagine
that<00:06:30.570> in<00:06:30.690> the<00:06:30.840> future<00:06:30.870> they<00:06:31.410> will<00:06:31.590> be<00:06:31.740> adding

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
that in the future they will be adding

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.150 
that in the future they will be adding
more<00:06:32.160> watch<00:06:32.670> faces<00:06:33.300> at<00:06:33.570> some<00:06:34.500> point<00:06:34.800> probably

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
more watch faces at some point probably

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.270 
more watch faces at some point probably
version<00:06:35.700> 2.0<00:06:36.270> would<00:06:36.450> be<00:06:36.570> my<00:06:36.690> guess<00:06:36.960> and

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
version 2.0 would be my guess and

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.110 
version 2.0 would be my guess and
fingers<00:06:38.280> crossed

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
fingers crossed

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.700

watch<00:06:39.750> OS<00:06:40.520> 2.0<00:06:41.520> would<00:06:41.760> actually<00:06:42.120> be<00:06:42.240> called<00:06:42.710> W

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
watch OS 2.0 would actually be called W

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.409 
watch OS 2.0 would actually be called W
OS<00:06:44.010> because<00:06:44.250> then<00:06:44.490> it<00:06:44.640> would<00:06:44.730> be<00:06:44.820> like<00:06:44.940> iOS

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
OS because then it would be like iOS

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.290 
OS because then it would be like iOS
where<00:06:45.720> the<00:06:45.810> first<00:06:46.080> version<00:06:46.500> was<00:06:46.590> called

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
where the first version was called

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.720 
where the first version was called
iPhone<00:06:48.300> OS<00:06:48.510> and<00:06:48.990> then<00:06:49.350> turned<00:06:49.740> into<00:06:49.919> iOS<00:06:50.460> so<00:06:50.700> I

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
iPhone OS and then turned into iOS so I

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.040 
iPhone OS and then turned into iOS so I
think<00:06:50.850> it'd<00:06:51.090> be<00:06:51.150> cool<00:06:51.360> if<00:06:51.390> they<00:06:51.540> continued

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
think it'd be cool if they continued

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.350 
think it'd be cool if they continued
