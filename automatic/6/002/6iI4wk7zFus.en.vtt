00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that alright guys so I got both the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.870 
that alright guys so I got both the
shields<00:02:12.600> off<00:02:13.010> head<00:02:14.010> take<00:02:14.250> them<00:02:14.400> off<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> lot

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
shields off head take them off is a lot

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
shields off head take them off is a lot
easier<00:02:15.210> just<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:17.190> hit<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> bolts<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
easier just to get hit the bolts and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.240 
easier just to get hit the bolts and
twist<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:21.360> mufflers<00:02:21.750> off<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.290> front<00:02:22.709> muffler

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
twist the mufflers off the front muffler

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.240 
twist the mufflers off the front muffler
there<00:02:23.459> gave<00:02:23.730> me<00:02:23.850> some<00:02:24.650> some<00:02:25.650> trouble<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.130> was

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
there gave me some some trouble it was

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.800 
there gave me some some trouble it was
difficult<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.700> get<00:02:26.850> off<00:02:27.030> there's<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> burr

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
difficult to get off there's like a burr

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.580 
difficult to get off there's like a burr
on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.560> pipe<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.020> kind<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> made

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
on the pipe there that just kind of made

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.300 
on the pipe there that just kind of made
it<00:02:31.620> real<00:02:31.890> tough<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.250> get<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:34.190> ended<00:02:35.190> up

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
it real tough to get up I ended up

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.160 
it real tough to get up I ended up
letting<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.060> coming<00:02:36.720> back<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.050> this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
letting it go and coming back to it this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
letting it go and coming back to it this
morning<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.739> got<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.980> off<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:40.550> next<00:02:41.550> I'm

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
morning and I got it off so next I'm

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.220 
morning and I got it off so next I'm
going<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.180> actually<00:02:42.360> take<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:43.050> bit<00:02:43.170> of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
going to actually take a little bit of

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.740 
going to actually take a little bit of
sandpaper<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:46.040> file<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:48.060> area<00:02:48.540> down<00:02:48.720> here

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
sandpaper and file this area down here

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.270 
sandpaper and file this area down here
on<00:02:49.230> both<00:02:49.970> flanges<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.180> guess<00:02:51.360> are<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> pipes<00:02:52.280> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
on both flanges I guess are the pipes to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.610 
on both flanges I guess are the pipes to
smoothen<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.209> out<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.720> better<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
smoothen it out make it better for the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.010 
smoothen it out make it better for the
new<00:02:55.800> pipe<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.310> come<00:02:56.489> on<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.850> read<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.720> helps

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
new pipe to come on I read that it helps

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.380 
new pipe to come on I read that it helps
just<00:02:58.320> some<00:02:58.440> fine<00:02:58.739> grit<00:02:58.770> sandpaper<00:02:59.280> herbs<00:02:59.730> you

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
just some fine grit sandpaper herbs you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.220 
just some fine grit sandpaper herbs you
know<00:03:00.510> nothing<00:03:00.870> too<00:03:01.370> abrasive<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.020> clean

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
know nothing too abrasive just to clean

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.140 
know nothing too abrasive just to clean
up<00:03:04.350> any<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:05.130> know<00:03:05.250> burrs<00:03:05.459> or<00:03:05.730> something<00:03:06.060> like

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
up any you know burrs or something like

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.330 
up any you know burrs or something like
that<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.630> I'll<00:03:07.080> do<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.500> both<00:03:07.739> sides<00:03:07.799> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
that so I'll do that on both sides I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.120 
that so I'll do that on both sides I
also<00:03:11.340> wanted<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.730> show<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.090> bought<00:03:12.330> new

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
also wanted to show that I bought new

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.880 
also wanted to show that I bought new
crossover<00:03:14.130> gaskets<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.600> old<00:03:15.900> ones<00:03:16.170> are<00:03:16.470> still

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
crossover gaskets the old ones are still

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.400 
crossover gaskets the old ones are still
in<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.340> pipes

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
in the pipes

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.630 
in the pipes
the<00:03:19.410> original<00:03:19.799> pipes<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.489> there

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
the original pipes you can see in there

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.930 
the original pipes you can see in there
those<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.480> mesh<00:03:21.900> looking<00:03:22.380> things<00:03:22.760> they<00:03:23.760> look

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
those like mesh looking things they look

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.650 
those like mesh looking things they look
pretty<00:03:24.090> beat-up

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
pretty beat-up

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.449 
pretty beat-up
and<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.680> taking<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:26.070> off<00:03:26.190> for<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
and I I was just taking them off for the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.670 
and I I was just taking them off for the
first<00:03:26.610> time<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.390> definitely<00:03:28.350> recommend

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
first time so I definitely recommend

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
first time so I definitely recommend
buying<00:03:29.130> new<00:03:29.459> crossover<00:03:29.940> gaskets<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:32.570> mean<00:03:33.570> you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
buying new crossover gaskets I mean you

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.880 
buying new crossover gaskets I mean you
could<00:03:33.810> probably<00:03:34.019> get<00:03:34.230> away<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:34.440> using<00:03:34.709> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
could probably get away with using the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.990 
could probably get away with using the
once<00:03:35.070> more<00:03:35.430> but<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:37.620> were<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:37.920> 7<00:03:38.519> bucks<00:03:38.700> for

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
once more but they were like 7 bucks for

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.430 
once more but they were like 7 bucks for
the<00:03:39.090> pair<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.980> cheap<00:03:40.980> insurance<00:03:41.130> went<00:03:41.579> up<00:03:41.700> okay

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
the pair so cheap insurance went up okay

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.800 
the pair so cheap insurance went up okay
alright<00:03:43.440> guys<00:03:43.560> got<00:03:43.860> pipes<00:03:44.130> done<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.810> haven't
