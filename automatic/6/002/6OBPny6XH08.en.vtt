00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
stick then you're going to start the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.270 
stick then you're going to start the
curling<00:01:54.050> process<00:01:54.470> you're<00:01:54.800> going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.040> want<00:01:55.130> to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
curling process you're going to want to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.600 
curling process you're going to want to
take<00:01:55.430> small<00:01:55.960> groups<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.350> hair<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.009> wrap<00:01:58.460> it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
take small groups of hair and wrap it

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.399 
take small groups of hair and wrap it
around<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.060> barrel<00:01:59.479> instead<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.080> putting<00:02:00.350> it

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
around the barrel instead of putting it

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.230 
around the barrel instead of putting it
inside<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.280> curling<00:02:01.610> iron<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:02.060> kind<00:02:02.210> of

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
inside the curling iron just kind of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.760 
inside the curling iron just kind of
wrap<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.509> around<00:02:02.570> there<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:02.960> hold<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.619> key

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
wrap it around there and hold it the key

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.410 
wrap it around there and hold it the key
is<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.070> takes<00:02:04.280> small<00:02:04.640> groups<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.119> curls

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
is it takes small groups of curls

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.359 
is it takes small groups of curls
because<00:02:06.050> that<00:02:06.500> way<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.100> be<00:02:07.220> more

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
because that way it's going to be more

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.100 
because that way it's going to be more
curly<00:02:07.729> than<00:02:07.909> if<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.119> tickle<00:02:08.450> our<00:02:08.660> groups<00:02:08.929> of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
curly than if you tickle our groups of

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.890 
curly than if you tickle our groups of
curls<00:02:09.319> layer<00:02:09.830> by<00:02:10.069> layer<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:11.239> continue<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.750> do

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
curls layer by layer to continue to do

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.040 
curls layer by layer to continue to do
that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.320 

you<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.340> exact<00:02:20.700> same<00:02:20.730> thing<00:02:21.180> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
you want to do the exact same thing to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.540 
you want to do the exact same thing to
the<00:02:21.450> next<00:02:21.600> side<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:23.100> continue<00:02:23.520> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the next side there just continue to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.110 
the next side there just continue to
curl<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.240> then<00:02:25.080> once<00:02:25.800> you're<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:26.250> curling

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the top layer down this parts a little

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.220 
the top layer down this parts a little
more<00:02:50.640> tricky<00:02:50.820> because<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:51.810> part<00:02:52.140> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
more tricky because this is when part of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.720 
more tricky because this is when part of
your<00:02:52.320> hair<00:02:52.500> comes<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.160> you're<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.460> want<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
your hair comes so you're gonna want to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.930 
your hair comes so you're gonna want to
make<00:02:53.850> sure<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.780> get<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.760> whatever<00:02:56.760> goes

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
make sure that you get the whatever goes

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.280 
make sure that you get the whatever goes
on<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> Left<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.510> left<00:02:57.810> or<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.960> right<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
on the Left all left or the right on the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.490 
on the Left all left or the right on the
right<00:02:59.300> doesn't<00:03:00.300> take<00:03:00.540> as<00:03:00.720> long<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.930> curl<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
right doesn't take as long to curl the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.660 
right doesn't take as long to curl the
top<00:03:01.680> ones<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.100> they're<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> little<00:03:02.460> bit

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
top ones because they're a little bit

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.270 
top ones because they're a little bit
thinner<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> more<00:03:03.180> sensitive<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.860> don't

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
thinner and more sensitive but don't

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
thinner and more sensitive but don't
worry<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.640> looks<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.910> little<00:03:06.060> curly<00:03:06.540> because

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
worry if it looks a little curly because

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.400 
worry if it looks a little curly because
that's<00:03:07.530> how<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.770> should<00:03:07.830> look<00:03:09.050> just<00:03:10.050> finished

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that's how it should look just finished

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
that's how it should look just finished
by<00:03:10.560> curling<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.670> rest<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> layer<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.630> layer

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
by curling the rest of it layer by layer

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.720 
by curling the rest of it layer by layer
if<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.230> want<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.560> pin<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> little<00:03:14.130> bit<00:03:14.220> back<00:03:14.400> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
if you want to pin a little bit back and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.980 
if you want to pin a little bit back and
do<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:14.970> how<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.300> been<00:03:15.480> doing<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.720> rest<00:03:15.870> are

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
do it how you been doing the rest are

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.930 
do it how you been doing the rest are
here<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.380> for<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.710> but<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.100> get<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> little
