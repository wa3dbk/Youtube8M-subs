compliance<00:01:06.380> was<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:08.040> aided<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> fact

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
compliance was then aided by the fact

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.179 
compliance was then aided by the fact
that<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.689> achieved<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> those<00:01:10.650> things

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that we achieved all of those things

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.840 
that we achieved all of those things
with<00:01:11.520> smaller<00:01:12.270> diameter<00:01:12.750> tubes<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.580> have

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
with smaller diameter tubes then we have

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
with smaller diameter tubes then we have
used<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> past<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:17.009> smaller<00:01:17.430> than

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
used in the past and also smaller than

our<00:01:18.180> competitors<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.900> using<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.680> advantage

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
our competitors are using the advantage

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
our competitors are using the advantage
of<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> reduces<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> frontal

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
of that is that it reduces the frontal

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.350 
of that is that it reduces the frontal
area<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> bike<00:01:22.320> significantly<00:01:23.040> and

area of the bike significantly and
frontal<00:01:24.360> area<00:01:24.570> being<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> huge<00:01:25.110> component<00:01:25.409> of

riding so there was a huge success for
2013<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.909> wanted<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> bring<00:01:54.420> Evo<00:01:54.720> technology

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
2013 we wanted to bring Evo technology

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
2013 we wanted to bring Evo technology
to<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.219> even<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.579> people<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.090> added<00:01:57.240> two

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to to even more people so we added two

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.609 
to to even more people so we added two
different<00:01:57.810> frames<00:01:58.430> for<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.119> Evo<00:02:00.420> family<00:02:00.899> we

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
different frames for the Evo family we

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.980 
different frames for the Evo family we
added<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> Evo<00:02:02.219> carbon<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.630> exact

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
added the Evo carbon which is the exact

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
added the Evo carbon which is the exact
same<00:02:04.229> frame<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> Evo<00:02:04.979> Hammad<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.640> rather
