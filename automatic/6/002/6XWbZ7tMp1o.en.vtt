00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 were a must have marked 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.320
 an era and now we wish they weren't 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.270
 never existed what we are talking about 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.609
 but the looks of the stars to be more 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 precise of their hairstyles 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.750
 eccentric 90s and let's start with a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 look that we have renamed weapon 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 lethal for the simple reason that the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 featured in the films with 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.410
 pride 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 obviously we refer to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 character of rics played by mel 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.620
 gibson but the metropolitan hero was not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.320
 the only one to guard his own strength e 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 its charm in the foliage like a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 modern sansone to propose the tuft 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 voluminous at the top is a thick mane 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 behind there was also the singer Michael 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.910
 bolton and miley's dad 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 the king of the country billy ray cyrus 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.810
 investigating we also discovered that there is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.060
 a specific name for this hairstyle 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.180
 it is said mallett and from the homonymous song 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.670
 of the beastie boys and we move on to the typical 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 look of seattle sound or grunge 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 genus born in the rainy capital of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 state of washington 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 and if we say grange obviously we think 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 nirvana maybe the band par excellence 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.149
 of the genus and kurt cobain leader of the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.130
 group also dictated in terms of 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.170
 fashion introduced to the fantastic 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.079
 flannel shirts a little jeans 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 battered and medium-long blond hair 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.350
 weeping willow 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.409
 yes because the hair also had to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.939
 transmit melancholy pain 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.340
 introspective and all this also passed 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.619
 for parting half head and le 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 a little bit up he says they did so much 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.869
 neglected and with masculine looks we pass 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.179
 to a feminine look launched or perhaps 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.249
 it would be better to say raised by the 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.200
 little princess of the pop britney spears 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.630
 we are obviously talking about braids 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.749
 show off in her first baby video clip 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 one more time in that young singer 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.770
 she played the sexy schoolgirl with the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.749
 currency slightly modified and i 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.789
 elastic with pink plumage 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.009
 here we would like to tell you that in reality these 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.259
 elements were a nasty rip-off 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.959
 of the look of alicia silverstone in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.330
 girls in beverly hills and that unfortunately 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.209
 the braids are returning even if in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.569
 another form the crown braid that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.569
 in style 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.080
 to understand flaunted by katy perry e 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.540
 vanessa hudgens for example and this already 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.950
 it was enough to acclaim the return of the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.069
 bride mania 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.629
 if you have a girlfriend, stop it 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.209
 always remaining in the musical theme 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.730
 let's talk about boy band looks in which 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.019
 unfortunately two things depopulated that not 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.440
 I know how many of you have had the courage 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.360
 to simulate a blonde bob to the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.099
 nick carter of the backstreet boys 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.099
 the most loved guy in the group with 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.019
 that terrible line in the middle two the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.120
 platinum blonde associated with a head 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.069
 shaved for robbie williams in a period 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.290
 take that and it has hair maybe 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.170
 permanent for justin timberlake 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.720
 at the time of the ensink sentmente 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.500
 we thank you that all this has passed 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.650
 remote and in the first place we put the look 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.720
 from idol tv that is the look that takes over 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 that of a great star and diva as she is 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.099
 was in the 60s with marilyn monroe 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.769
 which caused the blond to dye and make the cotton 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.989
 hair also to his oriental fans who 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.610
 they desperately wanted to look like 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.739
 she 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.380
 here in the 90s instead of marilyn 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.489
 monroe the women copied her jennifer 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.739
 aniston 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.620
 or rather rachel green his character 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.600
 in the beloved series france impacts the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.910
 rachel cut characterized by 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.130
 scaled lengths and volume shows 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.769
 some matches in the mid-nineties 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.670
 was elected hairstyle of the year by 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 several magazines 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.540
 fortunately jennifer aniston is 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.840
 succeeded in moving forward and progressing 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 also in the look and then the arrived 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.889
 time to publicly admit that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.840
 you have even envied 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.269
 tried these looks by commenting here 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.730
 under well if you still wear them we hope 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.109
 to have made you understand that time to give us 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.109
 a cut bye
