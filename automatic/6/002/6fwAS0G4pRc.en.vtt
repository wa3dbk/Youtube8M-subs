00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.379
 plus 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.389
 hello friends how are you today 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.430
 we will be doing a small video 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.580
 because we're going to do a little review 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.759
 about these three elements that good 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.380
 are stylus pencils curiously this 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.829
 this stylus pencil was given to me by a friend 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.079
 to our table this with this little 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.390
 gomita good highest know a lot but 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.420
 here we have it and in fact my friend is 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.240
 here in salutes 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.160
 good he gave me this little one she is of 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.620
 light because you can whole that I bought myself 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.100
 my surface rt and then we did some 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.500
 tests about how they work 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.520
 precisely each one of these in this 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.380
 case I have 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.930
 then 33 small pencils good these 2 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.940
 one of the brand mode they tell me is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 a very good mark of in 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.990
 issues of cell phone accessories 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.740
 and tablets and these other things that is 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.690
 a mark then strange that is called 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.890
 ringer had never heard this mark 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.360
 but good 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 I guess it's also good because 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 Well, the only thing you can help us do 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 since it is a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.440
 well here I have here is my friend who 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 brought me this little pencils is the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.460
 original microsoft pencil 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.180
 pro 2 what you can not tell about 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.180
 this little pencil 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 in this they more than anything too 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.510
 comfortable for drawing time 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.610
 also to describe is detected 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.400
 perfectly what is the pressure and 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.190
 also the touches that you can do with 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480
 he can configure it freely and 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.950
 here we have the back but 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.040
 you can set it up like a rubber band 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.810
 as you can see is retractable we have 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.420
 this also in a single button here and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.520
 simple that allows us to click and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.200
 logical we also have what would be the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 tip that also has pressure and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.330
 you can also click with it as if 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.630
 you had tapping directly on the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.340
 screen also small 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.580
 difficulties that we have with this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.710
 small pencil enapro 2 is because of the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.060
 lack of controllers and that's why 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.490
 It is advisable to download some 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
 drivers to download digital card 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.110
 qualcomm but bad I do not remember the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.090
 which allows you to have a wide range of 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.590
 configurations for what is being 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.490
 the original use of what is the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.500
 microsoft surface pro and pro 2 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.940
 Unfortunately as you noticed 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.460
 is incompatible with 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 what the freaks had been doing 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.970
 I will hold you can see that I am trying to 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.870
 be with this and really no no no no 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 works 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.819
 well, it's no longer applying a little bit 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 here our friend in sheet cut that then 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.220
 really pencil 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.349
 well I had seen in some pages 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.040
 of internet mainly on the page 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.079
 from microsoft that well the pencil from the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.510
 produced was going to be incompatible then 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 he just recently bought the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.879
 pro 2 and I have repeated to him that because 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.579
 I will bring it to my house so that 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.560
 can but I get to try then 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.660
 for example, here I have the one note and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.310
 is where I take my notes for school 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 for example a moment ago there was 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:32.510
 open in 2020 and I have it 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.540
 It turns out that if I do with my finger 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.600
 Well, we have a figure here 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.240
 I have as a mini light status the mode in 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.980
 the one that I recently bought we give 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.020
 mind that it has a very special tip 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.210
 has that some kind of fiber or 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.650
 something like that with which today I 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.650
 I can also make the same stroke 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.950
 I can draw normally with the other 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.990
 that has a kind of rubber tip 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.440
 is with this if I can not I can not sweep 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.170
 I have a hard time sweeping yes and if yes 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.870
 it looks like but we have a 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.410
 paste that to erase it from pencil and 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.990
 Well, the only thing that helps me is stop 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.420
 you can do the touches for example 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.030
 simply if I open something here 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.920
 application memes and help me to do 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.500
 you touch it but it does not help me 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.480
 do the sweep 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.850
 It costs a lot to do the sweep 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.750
 that I almost almost crack on the screen and 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.270
 Well, it can be a little bit like 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.010
 it says dangerous now well if we try 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.140
 us the pencil of the surface 2 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.610
 sorry for the surface pro then in 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.440
 this case we realize that in the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.350
 peit 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.390
 and the dream is going to work, as the 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 page that is incompatible then 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.740
 can 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.740
 for those who were in the idea of 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.020
 that worked on the rte is in no 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.330
 physical or not the truth that does not work 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.980
 so they do not spend money in vain os 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.380
 I suggest you buy or one like this 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.850
 mini like this one with this tip very 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.520
 strange of the fertilizer puts a little 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.350
 long to make it look but has a 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.890
 tip very very particular and with this if 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.890
 we can write 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.880
 and so with this if we can draw was 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.010
 pretty good 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.120
 well nothing else I wanted to do this little 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.860
 review of this of these three pencils the 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.360
 incompatibility of this which is that of 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.700
 microsoft that I would have delayed 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.190
 very much that it worked because the 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.330
 it 's really cool and it also 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.330
 hit here 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.969
 and there is supposed to be stuck there and 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.659
 it looks pretty nice the fact that for 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.479
 can carry your surface in your hand and so 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.550
 all very super super good prosperous ni 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.009
 mode does not work on the rte 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.239
 so then I'm going to have to 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.470
 get used to working as a little 

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:08.710
 as I have always done 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.320
 ok and good this is what we 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.150
 we have been everything for today 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.730
 I already know that I have not done any to a 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.380
 tutorial these days because well then I 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.480
 dedicated a lot to working with the surface 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.090
 and well, I've been pretty busy 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.100
 with the school schedule but 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.050
 Well I hope you liked it if you 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.050
 like to put little finger up and then 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.870
 with this one also asks in sheet that 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.350
 I hope you liked this review 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.660
 and as he says it for me 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.660
 Well then I say it with this bye
