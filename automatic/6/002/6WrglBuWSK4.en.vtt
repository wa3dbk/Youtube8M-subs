00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
crew also there they're pretty

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
crew also there they're pretty
interesting<00:01:03.090> except<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.309> some<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.610> find

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
interesting except for some people find

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.940 
interesting except for some people find
them<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.299> gross<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> way

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
them kind of gross because of the way

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
them kind of gross because of the way
that<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.280> move<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.439> personally<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.530> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that they move I personally think it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
that they move I personally think it's
pretty<00:01:11.220> interesting<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.170> just

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pretty interesting and you can see just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
pretty interesting and you can see just
how<00:01:13.260> many<00:01:14.420> tube<00:01:15.420> feet<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.460> various<00:01:17.460> parts

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
how many tube feet and various parts

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
how many tube feet and various parts
they<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> more

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040

interesting reef creatures that you can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.120 
interesting reef creatures that you can
get<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.650> an<00:01:22.770> easy<00:01:23.130> sea<00:01:23.610> star<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.570> keep<00:01:25.130> they

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
get it's an easy sea star to keep they

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.810 
get it's an easy sea star to keep they
are<00:01:26.189> fairly<00:01:26.939> Hardy<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.729> put<00:01:29.729> them

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
are fairly Hardy and they are put them

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
are fairly Hardy and they are put them
in<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.240> forget<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.049> far<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.380> feeding

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
in and forget them as far as feeding

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
in and forget them as far as feeding
because<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.310> take<00:01:33.150> care<00:01:33.360> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
because they will take care of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.969 
because they will take care of
themselves<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:34.200> always<00:01:34.560> seem<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> know

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
themselves they always seem to know

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.429 
themselves they always seem to know
right<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> food<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> floating<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> how

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
right where the food is floating and how

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.190 
right where the food is floating and how
to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.310> their<00:01:38.970> grasp<00:01:39.270> anyway<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to get some in their grasp anyway so I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
my Nova Extreme Pro lighting this is

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.440 
my Nova Extreme Pro lighting this is
going<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.690> have<00:02:02.400> aqua<00:02:03.400> illuminations<00:02:04.030> Sol<00:02:06.450> LED

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
going to have aqua illuminations Sol LED

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to have aqua illuminations Sol LED
lighting<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.410> we'll<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.100> video<00:02:10.230> just<00:02:11.230> on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
lighting and so we'll do a video just on

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.580 
lighting and so we'll do a video just on
that<00:02:12.180> wonderful<00:02:13.180> LED<00:02:13.810> lighting<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.410> what

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
that wonderful LED lighting and what

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.400 
that wonderful LED lighting and what
it's<00:02:14.770> capable<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.840> kind<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.140> fun

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
it's capable of and the the kind of fun

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.940 
it's capable of and the the kind of fun
you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.770> have<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.970> LEDs<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.320> anyway<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> just

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
you can have with LEDs so anyway I just

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.810 
you can have with LEDs so anyway I just
want<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.310> share<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> LC<00:02:22.210> v<00:02:22.390> next<00:02:22.660> time
