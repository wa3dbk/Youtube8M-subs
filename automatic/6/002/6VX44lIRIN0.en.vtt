if you look on the bottom here the way

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
if you look on the bottom here the way
it's<00:01:38.330> rounded<00:01:38.870> first<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.860> all<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.040> way<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it's rounded first of all the way the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.270 
it's rounded first of all the way the
base<00:01:40.430> plates<00:01:41.680> general<00:01:42.680> shape<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.220> a

base plates general shape is in a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.910 
base plates general shape is in a
perfect<00:01:43.490> rectangle<00:01:43.820> but<00:01:44.270> rounded<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.920> then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
perfect rectangle but rounded and then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.190 
perfect rectangle but rounded and then
there's<00:01:46.070> also<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:47.420> edge<00:01:47.540> has<00:01:47.750> been<00:01:47.900> rounded

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
there's also the edge has been rounded

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.160 
there's also the edge has been rounded
out<00:01:48.290> too<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.799> what<00:01:49.190> that's<00:01:49.400> for<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:50.360> heavy

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
out too and what that's for is a heavy

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.620 
out too and what that's for is a heavy
impact<00:01:51.680> often<00:01:52.580> when<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.760> board<00:01:53.000> breaks<00:01:53.330> it's

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
impact often when a board breaks it's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.270 
impact often when a board breaks it's
because<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:54.590> edge

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
because that edge

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.000 
because that edge
first<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.330> all<00:01:56.390> cuts<00:01:56.720> into<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> board<00:01:57.320> when

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
first of all cuts into the board when

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.039 
first of all cuts into the board when
the<00:01:58.130> board<00:01:58.340> flexes<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.030> that's<00:01:59.479> always<00:01:59.780> where

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
the board flexes and that's always where

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.890 
the board flexes and that's always where
board<00:02:00.320> snaps<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.580> we<00:02:01.700> rounded<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.540> out<00:02:02.689> in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
board snaps so we rounded that out in

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.410 
board snaps so we rounded that out in
two<00:02:03.140> ways<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.770> basically<00:02:04.580> our<00:02:04.970> trucks<00:02:05.240> make

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420
