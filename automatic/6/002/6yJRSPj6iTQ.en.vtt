00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.119
 make 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.760
 ten two years in those Europeans that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.520
 Olympic 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.950

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.079
 in his life show and it's a shame what 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.280
 what has happened but good 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.339
 the best way is to swim which is what 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.510

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.510

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.210
 giuseppe the box 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.210
 if it's by sun and of course it 's a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 by name is the most favorite of the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.890
 shanghai world list 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.080

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.300
 tad more but depending on this form 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.580
 that comes here that can give us 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
 can also give us a good day 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 Well, the Japanese are the big ones 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 dominators this year 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.020

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.410
 6 and 59 67 men have gone down by the minute 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.110
 in this hectometer the pregnancy none 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.780
 of them European let's see if in this 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 debrecen pool we see the first of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 they 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.180
 MatÃ­as moment in search of that minimum 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.760
 is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.530
 a tremendous one to take out the view has been 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.210
 also outside pizza you laugh 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.970
 champion swimmer of the country in the year 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.220
 past 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.220
 that has always been won is very good 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.410
 very good very well the 1st street of lugo 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.430
 ngic is at the end it was a tad 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.200
 something to get off the 11 60 72 very good 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 will have no problems accessing 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.860
 at the end then 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.690
 the truth is that 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.430
 it's worth noting the ease with the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.079
 that italy will draw clues because each 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.670
 because every championship we almost have 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.490
 to two new 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.099
 and all what a pity about mattia despite 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.239
 it has stayed by very little outside 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.510
 those games that minimum 10 072 finishes 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.690
 to do here in debrecen and they asked for 10 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.700
 045 for tomorrow's final 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.240
 because with this time I was in the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.240
 final sure
