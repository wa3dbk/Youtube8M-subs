00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.530
 Welcome to fit and happy 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.349
 today with the theme drums alive 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.660
 we need drumsticks for balls 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.779
 and then it gets really exciting 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.760
 alive combines drumming with aerobics 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.590
 movement and that connects the right 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.840
 and the left brain half does that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.240
 creative breaks down stress and makes you 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.519
 hellish a lot of fun when she can live 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.670
 you break everything down you can aggression 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.500
 Remove all dammed has one 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.150
 can with much intensity on the balls 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.430
 but you can also drum a bit 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.960
 gentler and wellness moderately on the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.640
 waves are what I'm drumming 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.769
 jogging, for example, can not get rid of 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.989
 can i get rid of form sealife 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:01:08.119
 I'll show you what it's all about 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:01:10.040
 trans goes live they are already 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.330
 By the way, if you are with both 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.810
 strengthen at the same time on the ball 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 drumming 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.880
 when we drum singles we drum 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.840
 with both arms change first 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 right then the left to the right 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.910
 then the left then the right and so on 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910
 continue 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 clicking 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.479
 At Citrix, we 're drumming on the outside of the ball 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.430
 and click the strength of a middle on 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.119
 best on top of your head then becomes 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 it a bit more intense 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.800
 3 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.020
 Crossover is a bit more difficult 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.030
 hit because you cross over 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.560
 beats the one kind beats them served 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 others and the other three again 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.100
 right in the middle of the ball 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.100
 one after the other it was clear 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830
 2 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.709
 good, really good 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.150
 So I feel so now I feel 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.370
 me so that can go on is 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.879
 already power there may be more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.099
 become 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.689
 Of course, now we also realize that we 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.069
 a little blow our pulse here 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.780
 already went up a bit 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.400
 maybe you can see that in ours, too 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.349
 See how much fun that has done 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.849
 if you look happily exhausted 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.060
 but not too much that you think 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.889
 okay but out sofa but now could 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.000
 it actually goes further so that 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.769
 We farmers a little more on 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.540
 the end of the hour is very gentle 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.789
 quiet make the pulse again 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.750
 goes down and you again very nice and 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.750
 can go home relaxed 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.080
 I think that's enough for today 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.880
 I enjoyed it a lot 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.880
 Hope you see you next time
