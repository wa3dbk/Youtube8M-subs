00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
about this door is it actually has two

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
about this door is it actually has two
closures<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> top

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
closures and if we look up at the top

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.240 
closures and if we look up at the top
there's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.200> there<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there's a second one up there and that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
there's a second one up there and that
second<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.759> again<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.119> color<00:01:54.390> matched<00:01:54.530> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
second one again is color matched the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
second one again is color matched the
nice<00:01:55.710> benefit<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> having<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> those<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
nice benefit to having two of those is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
nice benefit to having two of those is
it<00:01:58.229> keeps<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> door<00:01:58.829> line<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.520> being

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it keeps the door line is it's being

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.160 
it keeps the door line is it's being
opened<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.360> closed<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:00.810> means<00:02:01.049> you're

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
opened and closed which means you're

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.569 
opened and closed which means you're
going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.439> longer<00:02:01.770> life<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> door

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
going to get longer life out of the door

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.770 
going to get longer life out of the door
again<00:02:04.000> this<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.240> one<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.450> those<00:02:04.539> things<00:02:04.719> that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
again this is one of those things that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.779 
again this is one of those things that
costs<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> little<00:02:05.320> bit<00:02:05.469> more<00:02:05.619> but<00:02:06.399> in<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.609> long

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
costs a little bit more but in the long

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.249 
costs a little bit more but in the long
run<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.240> you're<00:02:07.359> not<00:02:07.479> having<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.719> replace<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
run if you're not having to replace the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.619 
run if you're not having to replace the
door<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.679> in<00:02:08.890> five<00:02:09.220> or<00:02:09.399> ten<00:02:09.580> years<00:02:09.819> it's<00:02:10.239> money

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
door and in five or ten years it's money

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.290 
door and in five or ten years it's money
well<00:02:10.929> spent

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
well spent

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.970 
well spent
okay<00:02:13.300> now<00:02:13.450> let's<00:02:13.629> talk<00:02:13.810> about<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.230> sweep<00:02:14.590> on

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
okay now let's talk about the sweep on

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.309 
okay now let's talk about the sweep on
the<00:02:15.129> bottom<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> door<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.870> sweep<00:02:17.140> is

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
the bottom of the door the sweep is

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.600 
the bottom of the door the sweep is
really<00:02:17.739> important<00:02:18.099> because<00:02:18.160> that's<00:02:18.370> what

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
really important because that's what

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.300 
really important because that's what
keeps<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:19.060> dirt<00:02:19.090> dust<00:02:20.049> wind<00:02:21.360> water<00:02:22.360> insects

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
keeps out dirt dust wind water insects

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.740 
keeps out dirt dust wind water insects
things<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.489> that<00:02:24.700> from<00:02:25.060> blowing<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.510> from

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
things like that from blowing in from

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.690 
things like that from blowing in from
underneath<00:02:25.989> your<00:02:26.230> door<00:02:26.530> nice<00:02:27.400> thing<00:02:27.640> about

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
underneath your door nice thing about

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.460 
underneath your door nice thing about
this<00:02:27.970> door<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.299> actually<00:02:28.599> has<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.750> triple<00:02:29.200> sweep

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
this door is actually has a triple sweep

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.039 
this door is actually has a triple sweep
instead<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.010> say<00:02:30.160> one<00:02:30.459> or<00:02:30.610> two<00:02:30.720> rubber<00:02:31.720> sweeps

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
instead of say one or two rubber sweeps

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.140 
instead of say one or two rubber sweeps
like<00:02:32.290> most<00:02:32.680> doors<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.849> reason<00:02:34.000> that's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
like most doors have the reason that's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.050 
like most doors have the reason that's
important<00:02:34.629> is<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> door<00:02:35.049> itself<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.650> not<00:02:36.060> flat

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
important is the door itself is not flat

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.670 
important is the door itself is not flat
from<00:02:37.390> one<00:02:37.599> side<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.079> next<00:02:38.170> at<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
from one side to the next at the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.289 
from one side to the next at the
threshold<00:02:38.920> where<00:02:39.370> people<00:02:39.640> walk<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.209> out

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
threshold where people walk in and out

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.660 
threshold where people walk in and out
of<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.480> door<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.989> step<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
of the door and step on that so this

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.130 
of the door and step on that so this
gives<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.090> good<00:02:43.239> contact<00:02:43.810> all<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> way

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
gives you good contact all the way

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.110 
gives you good contact all the way
across<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.980> again<00:02:45.549> that's<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> keep

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
across and again that's going to keep

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.420 
across and again that's going to keep
out<00:02:46.299> all<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.780> insects<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> wind<00:02:48.190> and
