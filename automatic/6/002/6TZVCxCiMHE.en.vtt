let's<00:00:30.480> imagine<00:00:30.900> under<00:00:31.199> force<00:00:31.710> entirely<00:00:32.070> solid

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
let's imagine under force entirely solid

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
let's imagine under force entirely solid
and<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.420> were<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> dig<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.320> tunnel<00:00:34.590> right

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and we were able to dig a tunnel right

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.260 
and we were able to dig a tunnel right
from<00:00:35.430> north<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> south<00:00:35.969> pole<00:00:36.530> like<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.800> one

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
from north to south pole like this one

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
from north to south pole like this one
now<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:39.840> happen<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> jumped<00:00:40.800> into

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
now what would happen if you jumped into

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.580 
now what would happen if you jumped into
it<00:00:44.420> what<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> remember<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it what you have to remember here is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.270 
it what you have to remember here is
gravitational<00:00:47.460> force<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> how<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.629> works<00:00:49.280> as

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
gravitational force and how it works as

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.459 
gravitational force and how it works as
I<00:00:50.309> mentioned<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> last<00:00:51.059> episode<00:00:51.469> gravity

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I mentioned in the last episode gravity

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560 
I mentioned in the last episode gravity
is<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> force<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> attracts<00:00:53.550> objects<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is a force that attracts objects that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.619 
is a force that attracts objects that
have<00:00:54.750> mass<00:00:54.780> towards<00:00:55.590> each<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:56.210> however<00:00:57.210> if

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
have mass towards each other however if

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
have mass towards each other however if
you<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> shape<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> earth<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you look at the shape of the earth you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
you look at the shape of the earth you
see<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:00.809> matter<00:01:01.500> right

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
see that there is not only matter right

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
see that there is not only matter right
below<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.000> there's<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.449> matter<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
below you but there's also matter to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
below you but there's also matter to
your<00:01:04.080> left<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> why

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
your left and to your right so why

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.700 
your left and to your right so why
aren't<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.229> pulled<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> side<00:01:09.409> well<00:01:10.409> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
aren't we pulled to the side well it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
aren't we pulled to the side well it's
simple<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.369> gravitational<00:01:11.729> components<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
simple the gravitational components to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620 
simple the gravitational components to
the<00:01:12.570> left<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.320> once<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.760> pull<00:01:15.509> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the left and once to the right pull in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
the left and once to the right pull in
opposite<00:01:16.080> directions<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.340> therefore

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
opposite directions and will therefore

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.810 
opposite directions and will therefore
cancel<00:01:18.540> each<00:01:18.720> other<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.159> all<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.490> remains

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
cancel each other out all that remains

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.530 
cancel each other out all that remains
as<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> component<00:01:21.810> pulling<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> downwards

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
as a component pulling you downwards

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.310 
as a component pulling you downwards
that's<00:01:24.540> how<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.869> works

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
that's how it works

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.850 
that's how it works
hence<00:01:27.040> once<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:28.150> jumped<00:01:28.690> it's<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:29.050> whole<00:01:29.290> you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
hence once you jumped it's a whole you

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.890 
hence once you jumped it's a whole you
will<00:01:29.890> fall<00:01:30.340> down<00:01:30.370> it's<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.360> earth<00:01:31.510> and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
will fall down it's the earth and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.650 
will fall down it's the earth and
towards<00:01:32.350> its<00:01:32.530> center<00:01:33.120> accelerating<00:01:34.120> us<00:01:34.330> you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
towards its center accelerating us you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.870 
towards its center accelerating us you
go<00:01:37.440> but<00:01:38.440> what<00:01:38.620> happens<00:01:38.980> once<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.400> reach<00:01:39.700> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
go but what happens once you reach a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.110 
go but what happens once you reach a
center<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:41.140> supposed<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.100> popular<00:01:42.610> belief<00:01:42.640> you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
center I supposed to popular belief you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.290 
center I supposed to popular belief you
would<00:01:43.540> not<00:01:43.810> be<00:01:44.050> crushed<00:01:44.320> by<00:01:44.680> gravity<00:01:45.160> in<00:01:45.520> fact

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
would not be crushed by gravity in fact

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.170 
would not be crushed by gravity in fact
it<00:01:46.600> would<00:01:46.960> be<00:01:46.990> quite<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.740> opposite<00:01:48.180> well

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
it would be quite the opposite well

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.580 
it would be quite the opposite well
let's<00:01:49.660> look<00:01:49.870> at<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.140> different<00:01:50.500> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
let's look at the different to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.460 
let's look at the different to
gravitational<00:01:50.979> components<00:01:51.640> again<00:01:52.260> again<00:01:53.260> we

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
gravitational components again again we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.490 
gravitational components again again we
have<00:01:53.680> mass<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.670> left<00:01:55.060> as<00:01:55.450> well<00:01:55.780> as<00:01:56.020> mass<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
have mass to the left as well as mass to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.040 
have mass to the left as well as mass to
the<00:01:56.530> right<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.330> components<00:01:58.840> will<00:01:59.020> cancel

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the right so the components will cancel

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.940 
the right so the components will cancel
out<00:02:00.570> furthermore<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:02.080> also<00:02:02.110> have<00:02:02.590> equal

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
out furthermore we also have equal

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.330 
out furthermore we also have equal
amounts<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.280> mass<00:02:03.460> below<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.210> above<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:06.160> these

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
amounts of mass below and above so these

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.480 
amounts of mass below and above so these
components<00:02:06.940> cancel<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.450> well<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.979> result

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
components cancel as well as a result

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.610 
components cancel as well as a result
once<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.330> reach<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.630> center<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.290> earth
