pretty<00:05:25.400> strong<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:25.970> we're<00:05:26.740> clearing<00:05:27.740> them

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
pretty strong and we're clearing them

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.500 
pretty strong and we're clearing them
out<00:05:27.980> pretty<00:05:28.220> nicely<00:05:28.490> here<00:05:28.790> besides<00:05:29.150> this<00:05:29.300> town

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
out pretty nicely here besides this town

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.690 
out pretty nicely here besides this town
home<00:05:29.690> so<00:05:30.410> maybe<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:31.040> Queen<00:05:31.190> will<00:05:31.340> still<00:05:31.550> pick

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
home so maybe the Queen will still pick

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.280 
home so maybe the Queen will still pick
it<00:05:31.850> up<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.060> don't<00:05:32.240> know<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.480> expo<00:05:32.840> still<00:05:33.080> has<00:05:33.260> a

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
it up I don't know the expo still has a

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.160 
it up I don't know the expo still has a
lot<00:05:33.530> of<00:05:34.360> shots<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:35.690> so<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:35.870> don't<00:05:36.110> think

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
lot of shots in it so I don't think

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.920

it'll<00:05:36.350> run<00:05:36.560> out<00:05:36.740> maybe<00:05:37.340> if<00:05:37.550> these<00:05:37.930> skeletons
