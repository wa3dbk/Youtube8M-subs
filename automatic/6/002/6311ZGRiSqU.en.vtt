savings I think the important thing

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.140 
savings I think the important thing
there<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:44.010> keep<00:04:44.160> track<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.730> how<00:04:44.820> much<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
there is to keep track of how much you

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.450 
there is to keep track of how much you
save<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.660> actually<00:04:46.050> pay<00:04:46.320> yourself<00:04:46.770> every<00:04:47.250> day

save and actually pay yourself every day
for<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.150> amount<00:04:48.450> otherwise<00:04:49.260> you're<00:04:49.980> just

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
for that amount otherwise you're just

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.280 
for that amount otherwise you're just
giving<00:04:50.520> up<00:04:50.640> something<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.000> enjoyed<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.990> not
