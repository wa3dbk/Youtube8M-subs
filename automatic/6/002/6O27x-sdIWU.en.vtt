00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.080 
and then if you have any bumps that you
don't<00:04:47.050> like<00:04:47.260> take<00:04:47.770> bobby<00:04:48.070> pins<00:04:48.430> just<00:04:48.550> put<00:04:48.940> them

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
don't like take bobby pins just put them

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.940 
don't like take bobby pins just put them
but<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.450> kind<00:04:49.720> of<00:04:49.780> like<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.140> bumps<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.710> have

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
but I kind of like the bumps that I have

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.330 
but I kind of like the bumps that I have
because<00:04:51.730> I<00:04:51.790> think<00:04:51.850> it<00:04:52.180> kind<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:53.130> makes<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
because I think it kind of makes the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.410 
because I think it kind of makes the
hair<00:04:55.740> okay<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.550> now<00:04:57.730> that<00:04:57.760> we<00:04:58.060> have<00:04:58.210> those

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
hair okay so now that we have those

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.420 
hair okay so now that we have those
bobby<00:04:58.660> pins<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.110> they<00:04:59.350> get<00:04:59.740> kind<00:04:59.890> of<00:04:59.980> visible
