00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
values and go to counter-strike and then

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.840 
values and go to counter-strike and then
scan<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.640> change<00:00:47.969> SV<00:00:48.420> cheats<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.680> 1<00:00:50.070> 2<00:00:50.280> 3<00:00:50.489> 4

but<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.629> random<00:01:00.960> number<00:01:01.430> where<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:03.390> long

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but just any random number where as long

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.179 
but just any random number where as long
as<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.899> odd<00:01:04.049> number<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.589> should<00:01:04.769> work<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
as it's an odd number it should work so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.300 
as it's an odd number it should work so
you<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.760> next<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.600> only<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.930> came<00:01:07.080> up

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
you do next can see only one came up

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.420 
you do next can see only one came up
change<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> value<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> 1<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.930> freeze<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
change the value to 1 then freeze it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.380 
change the value to 1 then freeze it
and<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.110> isn't<00:01:13.440> like<00:01:13.650> foolproof<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.460> getting

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and this isn't like foolproof on getting

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.290 
and this isn't like foolproof on getting
banned<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:15.870> anything<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.520> works<00:01:17.850> most

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
banned or anything but it works most

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.340 
banned or anything but it works most
time<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.190> go<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> any<00:01:22.070> game<00:01:24.350> takes

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
time so just go to any game takes

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.930 
time so just go to any game takes
forever<00:01:25.530> load<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.490> hypercam<00:01:28.940> I'll

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
forever load with this hypercam I'll

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:46.400 
forever load with this hypercam I'll
just<00:01:30.120> go<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.300> Scott's<00:01:30.750> knives

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.780 

okay<00:01:47.410> so<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.710> should<00:01:47.830> join<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.980> game<00:01:48.160> see<00:01:48.610> there

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
okay so you should join a game see there

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.810 
okay so you should join a game see there
people<00:01:49.300> playing<00:01:51.120> so<00:01:52.120> kind<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.720> laggy<00:01:52.980> but<00:01:53.980> over

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
people playing so kind of laggy but over

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.880 
people playing so kind of laggy but over
here<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.300> then<00:01:56.080> what<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:56.680> open

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
here and then what you want to do open

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.470 
here and then what you want to do open
console<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.080> then<00:01:59.080> go<00:01:59.970> our<00:02:01.290> underscore<00:02:02.290> draw

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
console and then go our underscore draw

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.900 
console and then go our underscore draw
other<00:02:05.760> models<00:02:06.760> too<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.100> then<00:02:09.100> once<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.760> do

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
other models too and then once you do

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.510 
other models too and then once you do
that<00:02:10.119> everything<00:02:10.930> will<00:02:11.110> be<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> wireframe<00:02:11.520> so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
that everything will be a wireframe so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.430 
that everything will be a wireframe so
you<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.700> see<00:02:12.820> people<00:02:13.150> through<00:02:13.330> walls<00:02:13.450> well<00:02:14.320> as

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
you can see people through walls well as

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.050 
you can see people through walls well as
soon<00:02:14.620> as<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.640> need<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.820> minimize

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
soon as you do that you need to minimize

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.640 
soon as you do that you need to minimize
counter-strike<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.170> minimize

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
counter-strike on so minimize

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.280 
counter-strike on so minimize
counter-strike<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.520> then<00:02:22.480> close<00:02:22.900> cheat

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
counter-strike and then close cheat

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
counter-strike and then close cheat
engine<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.510> not<00:02:28.540> close

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
engine and because if you do not close

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.370 
engine and because if you do not close
cheat<00:02:29.200> engine<00:02:29.970> vac<00:02:30.970> will<00:02:31.510> pick<00:02:31.720> up<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:32.110> cheat

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
cheat engine vac will pick up your cheat

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
cheat engine vac will pick up your cheat
engine<00:02:32.530> running<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:34.570> could<00:02:34.720> get<00:02:34.900> banned

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
engine running and you could get banned

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.089 
engine running and you could get banned
so

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.459 

so<00:02:46.109> I'm<00:02:47.109> really<00:02:47.409> laggy<00:02:47.709> right<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.159> but<00:02:48.519> with

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
so I'm really laggy right now but with

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.039 
so I'm really laggy right now but with
the<00:02:50.469> walls<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.389> so<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.599> see<00:02:52.749> everyone

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
the walls on so you can see everyone

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.459 
the walls on so you can see everyone
through<00:02:53.230> walls<00:02:53.439> or<00:02:53.620> wireframe<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.290> works

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
through walls or wireframe so it works

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.989 
through walls or wireframe so it works
pretty<00:02:56.620> good<00:02:56.859> but<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.159> cheatengine<00:02:57.459> clothes

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:57.999 
pretty good but with cheatengine clothes

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.129 
pretty good but with cheatengine clothes
there's<00:02:58.359> no<00:02:58.659> way<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:59.109> get<00:02:59.230> banned<00:02:59.469> at<00:02:59.950> all

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
there's no way you can get banned at all

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.370 
there's no way you can get banned at all
so<00:03:02.139> it'll<00:03:02.889> work<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.040> fine
