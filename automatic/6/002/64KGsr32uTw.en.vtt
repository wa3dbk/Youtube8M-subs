 Hi everyone, how are you? All right, the speaker is the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 desire for rock plus a quick video with 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.660
 a fantastic tip about blue hair 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.189
 It's the following people this week I did 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 one question in the group is the group I 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.590
 I asked this question called colorimetry 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.700
 capillary I lose fear if you do not participate 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.469
 here I think in the description somewhere 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 There will be a link from this group so that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.100
 You participate, it's good, and in this group, we 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 we interact we learn with each other 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 where to go only enters professional and all 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 we are there to help each other 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.739
 and this reality and was raised one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 doubt saying the following way we know 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 We know that if we have a hair that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.770
 it's orange if we apply blue on 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.300
 what happens we neutralize 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.810
 that unwanted color 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 so it 's creating the brown color because 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 brown because orange is the mixture of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.780
 yellow with red or both 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.229
 primary colors and we also have the blue and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.170
 the three primary colors together tas 3 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.570
 Mixed brown why we 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.240
 we say that we will neutralize the color 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 that is, let's make it the color of the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 brown hair 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.689
 Okay, and a big question has come up. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 and if we have blue hair like 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:47.250
 to neutralize this hair, ie 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.130
 I apply the orange on top of the blue idc 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.149
 here you are here on the side 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 we can neutralize this blue 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.180
 Now let me ask you a question. 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.110
 Do you know what a Flemish study is? 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 if it is not, I will leave a link from my blog 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 and there I have an article that I speak 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.039
 about the training fund but let's 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.720
 there understand some of the background increase 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.410
 we know that the study of the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 whitening 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.800
 is when you say color the hair or 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 even lightens with a coloring that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.950
 happens it will turn out to be the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.500
 whitening of one of a degree that is 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 from red to light yellow or 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.720
 each on its scale 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.530
 we only neutralize a desired color 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.130
 when it is the whitening fund or 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.040
 Now I ask you, is there a fund? 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.060
 that is blue green or 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.870
 Violet 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.990
 not because it does not exist because these colors 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 people are color, costumes are colors 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.210
 created is not a natural color that goes 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.450
 appear in hair or be colors 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.000
 costumes 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.240
 you can not apply an orange on 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.020
 and neutralized use if you have a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.820
 green 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.360
 if you apply a red on you 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.930
 can not neutralize because colors 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.590
 cold is always going to stand out 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.990
 that is how to solve this problem. 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.250
 very simple problem you have to 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.680
 remove this blue all hair 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.070
 removed this blue toast hair all over the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.870
 hair what are you going to do after 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.600
 you remove all 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.060
 I do not know the degree of planning that goes 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.470
 get that hair that every hair is a 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.230
 different hair 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.230
 okay can reach our very light can 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.040
 to arrive in the green can arrive I do not know God 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.190
 You know 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.350
 but it will arrive coming an example let's go 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.850
 from the assumption that we arrived at 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.030
 very light blue 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.220
 now we are going to neutralize it because 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.550
 we removed all that color 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.970
 after he got up there there nine well 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.690
 light blue knows half bluish you go 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.020
 do 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.660
 There you go and get the orange you go 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.830
 make a pre pigmentation either the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.799
 hair whitening fund 6 of the 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.320
 orange is the 6 is the number 6 then you 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.169
 will get a coloring of number 6 with 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.730
 four or quite heavily charged 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.340
 pretty orange 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.890
 will do a pre-pigmentation made the pre 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.480
 pigmentation you now enter with the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.500
 coloring ok 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.930
 Can you understand people if you pick them up? 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.180
 this hair that case and make direct 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.600
 forget nothing going to happen 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.250
 so the secret is to remove the fancy color 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.880
 to enter the color you want 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.170
 would you like 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.080
 ok give a simple easy and quick tip is 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.090
 the next one every time I go 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.790
 post questions I'll always be 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.520
 interacting because this is legal because 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.940
 makes us leave the comfort as it does 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.950
 we think makes us search makes 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.770
 we chase after our 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.780
 This is what makes people 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.580
 moves and against us 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.220
