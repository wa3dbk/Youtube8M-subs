00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 in this video I will tell you everything I know about 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.569
 artifacts and what is connected with them 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.670
 at first 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.889
 or search for artifacts need to get 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.679
 special thing called 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.460
 magnetic capture artifact or abbreviated 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 I am for them 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.609
 in the game there are three types of enzo 1 issued on 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.130
 station awards for doing one of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 initial quests is for their prototype 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 it weighs a lot and consumes more 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.000
 energy in contrast to the usual m for 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.040
 so what 's good except for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.290
 workout spares no productive 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520
 art company 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.860
 ordinary magnetic grip can 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 purchase from scientists at a Vesuvius location 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 or buy other players and finally 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.059
 modular for them sold in Donat 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.579
 store and different from the first two topics 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.829
 that when a character dies, it does not fall out of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 sharing giving 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.110
 artifacts are divided into categories alpha and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.660
 beta 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 alpha the most common artifacts and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.399
 you can find them anywhere but best 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.100
 search in places where anomalies accumulate so 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.979
 called anomalous fields 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.510
 artifacts of beta group except antigrav 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.150
 appears only in location anomalies 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.520
 thin lakes antigravs beta 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 can be found in other locations if 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 rummage through some guts 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.390
 mutants to go for artifacts on 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.689
 thin lakes can be located only by 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 reaching level 14 and performance 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 quests leading to this location in the game 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 there are very expensive explorer artifacts and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.470
 Zoom and evil in places of their sharp sometimes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 on duty whole clans 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 no lens there is absolutely not useful 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 but a good trunk is not very useful 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.180
 less good reaction but this is already quite 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.040
 other story 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 Further, for greater reliability, it is desirable 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.869
 get appropriate suits 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.420
 that is, protection from anomalies such clothes 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.060
 will not make you invulnerable but significantly 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.770
 will increase the chances of survival in places with 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.439
 increased abnormal activity 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.979
 This is especially useful on the location of thin 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.619
 lakes 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.899
 as the location is huge rez points then 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.750
 no therefore no extra protection 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.160
 will be superfluous 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.040
 we still need batteries 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.500
 capacitors charge deactivator and 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:19.080
 Of course, luck and windows like this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.170
 looks like an anomalous field to dig not 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.600
 dig up remembering what labor did 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.780
 we get our monkey out 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.910
 stalker chopper I mean enzo for this 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.100
 you need to right-click on the icon 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.620
 im for amber and select item 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.810
 use but best place 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.480
 it on the quick slots panel and turn on 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.280
 the corresponding key collecting 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.860
 artifacts don't forget to look at 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.170
 be more attentive to the parties 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 be that nearby stalker grazes not 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.240
 sharing the idea of ​​bran monkey 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.470
 but firmly convinced that the collage 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.900
 puts the monkey above man and here 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 artifact see how it is displayed on 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 radar to get it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.020
 need to get close to him so close 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.240
 to. on the radar hit the inside 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.580
 square and at the same time try not 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.980
 plunge into the anomaly then pinch 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.130
 the key for the cursor to appear at me 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.050
 alt by default we direct it to 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.420
 point and left click 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.760
 activated the slider and as it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.770
 movements will randomly appear numbers 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.530
 who need to have time to click on 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.530
 keyboard all the artifact in our pocket 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.930
 so we have a lot of artifacts and what are we with 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.090
 we can do them first ask 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.430
 note that artifacts do not last forever 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.010
 they have a timer and time expires 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.170
 they just disappear but for now 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.660
 happened you can sell them to the buyer 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.630
 or other players exchange for cartridges 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.930
 weapons and belongings or extract from them 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.850
 charges that will not disappear charges 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.100
 artifacts can also be sold or 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.920
 exchange or make charges of them 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.700
 another group for example from alpha beta from 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.700
 beta gamma 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.460
 and you can equip them for some 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.080
 time to get for example from the charge of the bill 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.800
 increased smoking stamina or 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.990
 endurance 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.820
 from antigrav charge for equipment 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.370
 only fresh charges are suitable 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.140
 overdue will exchange sales 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.480
 or crab to extract charges and from 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.120
 artifacts we need a capacitor and 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.250
 batteries activator and studied and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.340
 necessary perks which are specified in 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.350
 description of the artifact chance of success 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.300
 extract charge from artifact not 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340
 depends on pumping therefore remains 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.500
 rely solely on luck 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.350
 if she is on your side you will get 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.660
 charge if there is no weak charge which 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.370
 can be thrown out or destroyed by dragging 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.890
 to the basket icon in inventory 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.500
 I advise you to destroy such lamps and not 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.880
 pig 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.590
 capacitors can be obtained for example from 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.200
 Khabar Buyer in the area 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.720
 referred to as stalkers and Marek in exchange for 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.920
 boar meat 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.350
 deactivator look for scientists they with 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.220
 happy to exchange it for artifacts here 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.770
 that's all 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.690
 Guide is designed for beginners write

 please in the comments if i am somewhere 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.710
 made a mistake and share additional
