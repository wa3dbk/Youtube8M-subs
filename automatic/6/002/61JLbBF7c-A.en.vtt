00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.219
 now then we're going to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.190
 present these things art in particular 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.140
 the race model of repro and race air are 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.599
 exactly the same the only difference 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.009
 is the manufacture for example the suit 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.990
 The watch is made of fiber 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.720
 carbon and life theater has a weight 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.670
 of thousand 250 grams and the razr is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.830
 made of very flexible fibers and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.379
 it weighs approximately one thousand 450 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.900
 grams another difference they have and the 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.850
 last the two helmets would this spoiler 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.100
 which is manufactured to avoid 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.280
 high speed turbulence thing that 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 as you can see the razr does not have it 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.180
 since the race r pro is a helmet that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.910
 takes many stones of the World Cup 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.010
 superbike moto2 is more focused on 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.800
 racing driver while the real cr 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.290
 which is a helmet more sport tourism 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.860
 make so many eventually output the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.160
 weekends as you can see 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.110
 the race data failed as a ration r 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.300
 It has two air intakes in the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.440
 upper part that can be operated 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 even with gloves on 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.630
 an air intake in the front 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.260
 and a large air inlet in what 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.480
 it would be the chin bar 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.700
 an important thing about this helmet is its 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.720
 Quick disassembly and assembly system 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.530
 of the visor simply with a click on 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.530
 these two sideburns 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.470
 if we stretch it we already have the bevel 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 outside 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.500
 to place it 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 we would do the same but in reverse 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.740
 we introduce the visor we tighten the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.200
 We rotate it and we have it 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.570
 inside 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 the visor of the helmet of the referee Rafael 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.850
 Repro is a very special visor for two 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.560
 motives one is a visor antifog not 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 chosen no type of pin look carries a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.829
 Anti-fog treatment and another is your 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.650
 thickness of up to 4.5 mm that 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.960
 at high speed impact 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.170
 as you can see it is a very safe helmet 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.460
 since it has been cataloged with five 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.360
 security stars as you can see 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.900
 here 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.870
 another contribution of this helmet is a system 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.060
 xxi fit this system allows for all 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.590
 the people who wear glasses because they like 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.150
 you can find many times is 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.100
 uncomfortable putting the game of the glasses in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.410
 some helmets shark has thought of 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 you since inside on 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.960
 example here we would introduce two 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.810
 pads that come in the pack in the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.030
 case of not having glasses fill and all 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.040
 this area here and in the case of carrying 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.800
 glasses we would remove the pads and 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.920
 this area here would stay totally 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.580
 free 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.580
 sharp comes equipped with a nose was 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:02.030
 and a beard a chin was extendable 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.670
 we can regulate it to make it bigger 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 can you catch it let's talk about the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.610
 Sar safety as you can see 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 It has three reflective points on the 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.980
 back for when we go 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.130
 driving in the dark we can 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.130
 watch 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.920
 another important thing of the helmet takes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.960
 double ring closure 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.180
 with magnetic closure 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.540
 the most innovative of the helmet is a system 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 patented of forcing of turrets like 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.189
 you can see inside the hull 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.769
 and a system of turrets that serve 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.049
 to absorb the impacts this wants 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.700
 say the vast majority of helmets 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.459
 market the interior of the helmet is 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.860
 totally totally flat 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.810
 when we receive an impact our 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.209
 head hits directly against this one 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.430
 by spam does not absorb almost any type of 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.079
 Impact Salt What you have done is makes 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.209
 small turrets then when 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.730
 our head hits inside the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.549
 helmet are you turrets are deforming 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.560
 a little bit and our head does not 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.020
 has such an abrupt impact but that the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.270
 helmet absorbs this blow 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.640
 another thing to discard highlighting the helmet 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.250
 is that everything completely washable inside 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.250
 It is hypoallergenic and antibacterial
