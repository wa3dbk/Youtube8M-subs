00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.010 

and<00:01:27.320> our<00:01:27.650> grown<00:01:27.890> crops<00:01:28.159> we<00:01:28.909> plant<00:01:29.240> what<00:01:29.990> we

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and our grown crops we plant what we

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.950 
and our grown crops we plant what we
call<00:01:30.260> our<00:01:30.350> six-day<00:01:30.590> crop<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.400> then<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:32.659> keep

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
call our six-day crop and then we keep

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.719 
call our six-day crop and then we keep
it<00:01:33.110> over<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.350> winter<00:01:33.470> for<00:01:33.710> two<00:01:33.830> years<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.670> it

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
it over the winter for two years so it

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.700 
it over the winter for two years so it
becomes<00:01:34.940> six<00:01:35.420> D<00:01:35.570> crop<00:01:35.810> first<00:01:36.290> year<00:01:36.470> than<00:01:36.650> a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
becomes six D crop first year than a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.999 
becomes six D crop first year than a
second<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.100> mean<00:01:37.310> crop<00:01:37.520> after<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:39.009> tunnels

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
second you mean crop after that tunnels

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.070 
second you mean crop after that tunnels
