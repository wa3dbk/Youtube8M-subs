00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.620 
just remembered that while we were going
through<00:02:09.580> all<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.819> ingredients<00:02:10.300> before<00:02:10.420> I

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
through all the ingredients before I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.600 
through all the ingredients before I
missed<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.050> rather<00:02:11.200> important<00:02:11.770> one<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.160> that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
missed a rather important one and that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.340 
missed a rather important one and that
is<00:02:12.850> some<00:02:13.330> onion<00:02:14.490> we're<00:02:15.490> using<00:02:15.670> red<00:02:15.970> onion<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
is some onion we're using red onion if I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.699 
is some onion we're using red onion if I
had<00:02:17.560> I'd<00:02:18.010> probably<00:02:18.370> use<00:02:18.580> brown<00:02:19.569> onion<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
had I'd probably use brown onion but the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.620 
had I'd probably use brown onion but the
nearest<00:02:20.830> supermarket<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.790> bit<00:02:21.940> over<00:02:22.090> 800
