Galaxy<00:00:16.480> Note<00:00:16.510> 2<00:00:17.519> definitely<00:00:18.519> you<00:00:18.670> don't<00:00:18.789> get

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
Galaxy Note 2 definitely you don't get

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.470 
Galaxy Note 2 definitely you don't get
the<00:00:19.150> entire<00:00:19.480> 64<00:00:20.260> gigabytes<00:00:20.769> and<00:00:21.099> it<00:00:22.060> looks

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
the entire 64 gigabytes and it looks

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.630 
the entire 64 gigabytes and it looks
like<00:00:22.539> they<00:00:22.810> do<00:00:22.869> take<00:00:23.260> a<00:00:23.289> little<00:00:23.500> bit<00:00:23.769> more<00:00:24.130> for

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
like they do take a little bit more for

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.320 
like they do take a little bit more for
the<00:00:25.210> system<00:00:25.630> as<00:00:25.810> well<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.800> looks<00:00:26.980> like<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
the system as well it looks like the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.760 
the system as well it looks like the
total<00:00:28.720> space<00:00:29.670> reported<00:00:30.670> here<00:00:30.910> is<00:00:31.529> fifty<00:00:32.529> two

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
total space reported here is fifty two

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.400 
total space reported here is fifty two
point<00:00:33.040> seventy<00:00:33.430> five<00:00:33.610> gigabytes<00:00:34.170> total<00:00:35.170> space

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
point seventy five gigabytes total space

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
point seventy five gigabytes total space
available<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.280> you<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:36.820> doing<00:00:38.160> calculations

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
available to you and doing calculations

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.360 
available to you and doing calculations
it<00:00:40.660> looks<00:00:40.899> like<00:00:41.079> they<00:00:41.230> reserved<00:00:41.710> about<00:00:41.920> four

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
it looks like they reserved about four

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.819 
it looks like they reserved about four
point<00:00:42.670> four<00:00:42.940> eight<00:00:43.120> gigabytes<00:00:43.750> for<00:00:44.590> the

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
point four eight gigabytes for the

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.869 
point four eight gigabytes for the
system<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:46.440> does<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:48.070> know<00:00:48.160> that's<00:00:48.550> four

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
system so does that you know that's four

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.119 
system so does that you know that's four
point<00:00:49.090> four<00:00:49.329> eight<00:00:49.449> plus<00:00:49.690> fifty<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.559> fifty<00:00:50.980> two

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
point four eight plus fifty to fifty two

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.510 
point four eight plus fifty to fifty two
point<00:00:51.370> seventy<00:00:51.730> five<00:00:51.940> gigabyte<00:00:52.530> equal<00:00:53.530> 64

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
point seventy five gigabyte equal 64

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.439 
point seventy five gigabyte equal 64
gigabytes<00:00:55.000> in<00:00:55.329> any<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:57.550> any<00:00:57.910> sense

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
gigabytes in any in any sense

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.750 
gigabytes in any in any sense
mmm<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.320> think<00:00:59.739> it<00:00:59.829> comes<00:01:00.129> up<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.430> little<00:01:00.579> short

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
mmm I think it comes up a little short

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.630 
mmm I think it comes up a little short
but<00:01:01.269> still<00:01:01.890> 50<00:01:02.890> gigabytes<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.860> lot<00:01:06.400> to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
but still 50 gigabytes is a lot a lot to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.870 
but still 50 gigabytes is a lot a lot to
work<00:01:06.820> with<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.450> if<00:01:07.870> you<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.170> one<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.440> these

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
work with and if you have one of these

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.970 
work with and if you have one of these
it's<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:10.030> 64<00:01:10.720> gigabyte<00:01:11.160> micro<00:01:13.080> SDXC<00:01:14.080> card<00:01:14.410> so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
it's a 64 gigabyte micro SDXC card so

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.150 
it's a 64 gigabyte micro SDXC card so
this<00:01:15.250> gives<00:01:15.550> you<00:01:15.760> an<00:01:16.090> additional<00:01:16.800> fifty<00:01:17.800> nine

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
this gives you an additional fifty nine

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.050 
this gives you an additional fifty nine
point<00:01:18.640> some<00:01:18.970> gigabytes<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.700> end<00:01:21.850> you

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
point some gigabytes so in the end you

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.690 
point some gigabytes so in the end you
end<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.540> with<00:01:22.990> over<00:01:23.350> 110<00:01:24.040> gigabytes<00:01:24.520> of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
end up with over 110 gigabytes of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.380 
end up with over 110 gigabytes of
storage<00:01:24.880> space<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.560> that's<00:01:27.460> definitely<00:01:27.730> a<00:01:28.120> lot

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
storage space so that's definitely a lot

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.730 
storage space so that's definitely a lot
to<00:01:28.540> work<00:01:28.690> with<00:01:28.720> what<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.350> do<00:01:29.560> with<00:01:29.710> all

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
to work with what can you do with all

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.640 
to work with what can you do with all
that<00:01:29.980> memory<00:01:30.550> it's<00:01:31.180> up<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.750> what<00:01:32.440> am<00:01:32.560> I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
that memory it's up to you what am I

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.430 
that memory it's up to you what am I
doing<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.160> like<00:01:33.520> downloading<00:01:34.450> videos<00:01:35.200> off
