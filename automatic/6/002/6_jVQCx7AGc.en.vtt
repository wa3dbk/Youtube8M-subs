00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
how plants do in space for a long time

how plants do in space for a long time
generally<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:48.110> well<00:00:49.309> generally

generally how do they do well generally
they<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.670> quite<00:00:51.449> well<00:00:51.890> especially<00:00:52.890> once<00:00:53.489> they

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
they do quite well especially once they

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.209 
they do quite well especially once they
get<00:00:54.390> exposed<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> proper<00:00:55.590> environment

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
get exposed to the proper environment

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.270 
get exposed to the proper environment
initially<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.090> did<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> means

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
initially we did not know what it means

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
initially we did not know what it means
to<00:00:59.460> grow<00:00:59.850> plants<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> absence<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.710> gravity

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to grow plants in the absence of gravity

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
to grow plants in the absence of gravity
but<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> turns<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.270> wasn't<00:01:03.559> gravity<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but it turns out it wasn't gravity that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.170 
but it turns out it wasn't gravity that
was<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.369> culprit<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:07.110> succeeding<00:01:08.180> with

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
was the culprit in not succeeding with

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
was the culprit in not succeeding with
plant<00:01:09.510> growth<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> lack<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
plant growth it was the lack of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
plant growth it was the lack of
convection<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> result<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
convection and as a result the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.490 
convection and as a result the
distribution<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> gases<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.909> forth<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
distribution of gases and so forth that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
distribution of gases and so forth that
prevented<00:01:16.500> proper<00:01:16.860> development<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:18.030> have

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
prevented proper development but we have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200 
prevented proper development but we have
come<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> long<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> learned<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
come a long way and learned how to do it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.840 
come a long way and learned how to do it
in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> meantime<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.590> grow<00:01:22.850> plants

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
in the meantime so we can grow plants

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840 
in the meantime so we can grow plants
quite<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> gravity<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.369> still<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> factor

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
quite well the gravity is still a factor

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.569 
quite well the gravity is still a factor
right<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.630> caused<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:29.009> focused<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
right what caused you to be focused on

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.350 
right what caused you to be focused on
that<00:01:29.820> aspect<00:01:30.290> well<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.430> conundrum<00:01:32.759> form

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that aspect well it's a conundrum form

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.109 
that aspect well it's a conundrum form
was<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.810> odd<00:01:33.930> years<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.680> find<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.159> why<00:01:35.520> every

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
was an odd years to find out why every

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.609

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
in the soil and this basic question as

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.999 
in the soil and this basic question as
to<00:01:44.070> how<00:01:44.520> tiny<00:01:45.450> cells<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.380> don't<00:01:46.619> have

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
sense and respond to gravity is just

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.429 
sense and respond to gravity is just
puzzling<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.070> one<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> aspects<00:01:59.759> of

puzzling and one of the aspects of

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.700 
puzzling and one of the aspects of

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
detecting how these things work ideally

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.359 
detecting how these things work ideally
requires<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.939> remove<00:02:06.869> gravity<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> factor

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
requires to remove gravity as a factor

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.370 
requires to remove gravity as a factor
and<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.910> way<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
and this way we can

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.140 
and this way we can
gradually<00:02:11.380> test<00:02:11.680> how<00:02:11.890> individual<00:02:12.520> components

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
gradually test how individual components

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.990 
gradually test how individual components

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.950 
samples back what do you do with them
when<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.630> get<00:04:59.750> them<00:04:59.810> well<00:05:00.800> we<00:05:01.100> will<00:05:01.960> analyze

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
when you get them well we will analyze

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.280 
when you get them well we will analyze
different<00:05:03.830> things<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.600> distribution

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
different things one is the distribution

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.879 
different things one is the distribution
of<00:05:06.380> these<00:05:06.530> amyloplasts<00:05:08.260> after<00:05:09.260> we<00:05:09.410> have<00:05:09.560> seen

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889

of these amyloplasts after we have seen
downlink<00:05:10.550> video<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.229> indicate<00:05:12.229> whether<00:05:12.410> we

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620

back<00:06:06.770> yes<00:06:07.669> indeed<00:06:07.880> now<00:06:08.720> I<00:06:08.750> found<00:06:09.229> it<00:06:09.440> very

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
back yes indeed now I found it very

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.830 
back yes indeed now I found it very
interesting<00:06:09.800> that<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.490> saw<00:06:10.850> that<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:11.270> ran<00:06:11.660> this

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
interesting that I saw that you ran this

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.840 
interesting that I saw that you ran this
experience<00:06:12.470> the<00:06:12.650> experiment<00:06:13.220> on<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.639> last

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
experience the experiment on the last

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.550 
experience the experiment on the last
flight<00:06:14.030> of<00:06:14.120> Columbia<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:14.960> we're<00:06:15.229> still<00:06:15.440> able

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
flight of Columbia and we're still able

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.529 
flight of Columbia and we're still able
to<00:06:15.710> get<00:06:15.919> some<00:06:16.100> results<00:06:16.280> back<00:06:16.760> from<00:06:16.789> downlinked

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
to get some results back from downlinked

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.800 
to get some results back from downlinked
images<00:06:17.930> right<00:06:18.110> yeah<00:06:18.889> that's<00:06:19.190> correct<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:20.240> was

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
images right yeah that's correct it was

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.710 
images right yeah that's correct it was
unfortunate<00:06:21.289> that<00:06:21.590> we<00:06:21.830> could<00:06:22.039> not<00:06:22.220> get<00:06:22.400> the

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
unfortunate that we could not get the

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.779 
unfortunate that we could not get the
biological<00:06:23.720> material<00:06:24.200> back<00:06:24.580> but<00:06:25.580> the

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
biological material back but the

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.930 
biological material back but the
downlink<00:06:26.620> suggested<00:06:27.620> strongly<00:06:28.010> that<00:06:28.220> we<00:06:28.550> had

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
downlink suggested strongly that we had

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.430 
downlink suggested strongly that we had

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
curvature as

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.860

he<00:06:30.500> had<00:06:31.010> expected<00:06:31.520> but<00:06:31.880> we<00:06:32.000> were<00:06:32.150> not<00:06:32.360> able<00:06:32.420> to

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
he had expected but we were not able to

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.480 
he had expected but we were not able to
confirm<00:06:33.290> this<00:06:33.500> because<00:06:33.800> we<00:06:33.950> never<00:06:34.100> received

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490
