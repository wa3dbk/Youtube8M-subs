00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
this is the undo function in vanilla

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.890 
this is the undo function in vanilla
minecraft<00:00:10.349> or<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.700> call<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.210> command

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
minecraft or you can call it the command

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810 
minecraft or you can call it the command
Z<00:00:13.170> function<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> control<00:00:14.160> Z<00:00:14.280> function<00:00:14.429> or

whatever so this is really cool because
you<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.279> actually<00:00:17.460> implement<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.000> into

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
you can actually implement this into

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420 
you can actually implement this into
your<00:00:18.359> survival<00:00:18.690> world<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.189> prevent<00:00:20.189> any

potential griefing opportunities that
might<00:00:23.189> arise<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.150> let<00:00:24.300> me<00:00:24.359> show<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.660> works

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
might arise so let me show how it works

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
might arise so let me show how it works
let's<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.529> myself<00:00:25.710> into<00:00:26.039> game<00:00:26.550> mode<00:00:26.580> s<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
actual software or just in like real

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
actual software or just in like real
life<00:00:50.550> let<00:00:51.510> me<00:00:51.539> give<00:00:51.690> myself<00:00:51.750> some

regeneration first so just like in real

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
regeneration first so just like in real
life<00:00:55.199> several<00:00:55.949> previous<00:00:56.550> safe<00:00:56.760> states<00:00:57.090> will

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
life several previous safe states will

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990 
life several previous safe states will
actually<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.719> recorded<00:00:58.280> let's<00:00:59.280> say<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> wanted

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
actually be recorded let's say I wanted

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.380 
actually be recorded let's say I wanted
to<00:01:00.059> place<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.050> stained<00:01:01.590> glass<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.550> like

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to place a stained glass here or like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
to place a stained glass here or like
something<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.710> inner<00:01:04.979> portal<00:01:05.250> frame

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
something like a an inner portal frame

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
something like a an inner portal frame
on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> glass<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.159> hopper<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
on the glass something and hopper on the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
on the glass something and hopper on the
wall<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.450> strangely

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
wall so these are really strangely

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
wall so these are really strangely
placed<00:01:10.290> items<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.790> soon<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.090> drink<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
placed items but as soon as I drink the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.260 
placed items but as soon as I drink the
undo<00:01:12.659> potion<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:14.010> undo<00:01:14.460> each<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.939> step

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
undo potion it will undo each one step

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.690 
undo potion it will undo each one step
by<00:01:15.390> step<00:01:15.799> just<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.100> happen<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
by step just like it would happen on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.840 
by step just like it would happen on
software<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.350> Windows<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:20.250> something<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
software in Windows or something that

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.410 
software in Windows or something that
you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> mean

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you know what I mean

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.710 
you know what I mean
so<00:01:21.960> it'll<00:01:22.470> also<00:01:22.590> undo<00:01:23.040> each<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> will

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so it'll also undo each one so it will

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.910 
so it'll also undo each one so it will
actually<00:01:24.840> undo<00:01:25.170> each<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.470> step<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.740> step

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
actually undo each one step by step

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
actually undo each one step by step
which<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.310> cool<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.030> let<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.390> just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
which is really cool so let me just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
which is really cool so let me just
demonstrate<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.110> let's<00:01:28.439> say<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> break

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
demonstrate that again let's say I break

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
demonstrate that again let's say I break
the<00:01:29.189> glass<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.240> break<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> bed

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the glass here and then break the bed

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.469 
the glass here and then break the bed
and<00:01:31.020> let's<00:01:31.680> say<00:01:31.829> break<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> torch<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and let's say break the torch and if I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.569 
and let's say break the torch and if I
undo<00:01:34.079> each<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.590> step<00:01:34.860> by<00:01:34.950> step<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.460> see

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
undo each one step by step you can see

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
undo each one step by step you can see
what<00:01:35.670> actually<00:01:35.970> happens<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.960> torch<00:01:37.229> gets

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
what actually happens so the torch gets

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
what actually happens so the torch gets
placed<00:01:37.650> back<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.159> bed<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.610> placed<00:01:38.850> back

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
placed back the bed will be placed back

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.840 
placed back the bed will be placed back
and<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> glass<00:01:40.320> pane<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.130> replace

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and then the glass pane we put replace

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760 
and then the glass pane we put replace
back<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.320> absolutely

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
back so I think this is an absolutely

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
back so I think this is an absolutely
beautiful<00:01:44.130> concept<00:01:44.640> I've<00:01:44.820> never<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.240> seen

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
beautiful concept I've never really seen

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
beautiful concept I've never really seen

put myself into a creative mode and I'll

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.200 
put myself into a creative mode and I'll
just<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> point<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> house

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
just like to point out that this house

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.959 
just like to point out that this house
was<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:54.600> created<00:01:55.350> by<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.280> last<00:01:56.460> guy<00:01:56.700> so

really good builds on part of Minecraft

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
really good builds on part of Minecraft
is<00:02:01.020> grabbed<00:02:01.290> enough<00:02:01.469> played<00:02:01.649> Minecraft<00:02:02.070> I

get some really cool schematics and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.869 
get some really cool schematics and
stuff<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.160> play<00:02:08.310> minecraft<00:02:08.700> and

stuff just go at play minecraft and
really<00:02:09.599> cool<00:02:09.720> things<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.979> let's<00:02:11.879> see

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
really cool things there so let's see

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.730 
really cool things there so let's see
here<00:02:12.540> are<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.690> command<00:02:12.930> blocks

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
here are the command blocks

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
here are the command blocks
well<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.190> does<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.000> really<00:02:15.240> is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
well this really does all this really is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050 
well this really does all this really is
is<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> whole<00:02:16.110> heap<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.530> clone<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.280> test<00:02:17.910> for

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
is a whole heap of clone and test for

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.630 
is a whole heap of clone and test for
blocks<00:02:18.300> commands<00:02:18.750> activating<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.800> order<00:02:20.130> ok

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
blocks commands activating in order ok

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880 
blocks commands activating in order ok
let's<00:02:20.820> set<00:02:20.940> some<00:02:21.240> let's<00:02:21.870> put<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.170> say<00:02:22.440> command

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
let's set some let's put a say command

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.950 
let's set some let's put a say command
here<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.790> see<00:02:23.940> what<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.090> mean<00:02:24.270> so

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
here just so you can see what I mean so

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.260 
here just so you can see what I mean so
what's<00:02:25.170> happening<00:02:25.470> here<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.340> house<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
what's happening here is this house is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.690 
what's happening here is this house is
actually<00:02:27.660> being<00:02:27.870> compared<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> template

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
actually being compared to the template

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.180 
actually being compared to the template
over<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.560> templates<00:02:32.130> are

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
over there and if the templates are

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.680 
over there and if the templates are
actually<00:02:32.520> different<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.000> test<00:02:33.270> will<00:02:33.450> blocks

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
actually different this test will blocks

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.020 
actually different this test will blocks
commands<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.920> test<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.370> blocks<00:02:35.610> command

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
commands this test for blocks command

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.560 
commands this test for blocks command
will<00:02:36.270> actually<00:02:36.830> fail<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:39.300> see<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:39.510> I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
will actually fail so let's see if I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.880 
will actually fail so let's see if I
place<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> command<00:02:40.230> block<00:02:40.320> over<00:02:40.590> there<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.770> can

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
place a command block over there you can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.320 
place a command block over there you can
see<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> command<00:02:41.550> block<00:02:41.760> has<00:02:41.910> updated

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
see that the command block has updated

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.640 
see that the command block has updated
and<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.570> can<00:02:42.690> see<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.110> template<00:02:43.470> now

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
and you can see that the template now

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.130 
and you can see that the template now
has<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.100> command<00:02:44.400> block<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.140> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
has a command block in there and the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.450 
has a command block in there and the
other<00:02:46.290> three<00:02:46.560> houses<00:02:46.740> over<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.070> are<00:02:47.310> also

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
other three houses over there are also

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.190 
other three houses over there are also
these<00:02:47.730> saved<00:02:48.000> States<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.050> won't

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
these saved States so they won't

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.870 
these saved States so they won't
actually<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> house<00:02:50.700> would

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
actually have so the house would

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.790 
actually have so the house would
actually<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> command<00:02:51.690> block<00:02:51.780> until<00:02:52.170> I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
actually have a command block until I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.580 
actually have a command block until I
put<00:02:53.610> another<00:02:53.880> update<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.300> let's<00:02:55.170> say<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.320> break

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
put another update on let's say I break

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.340 
put another update on let's say I break
the<00:02:55.740> rule<00:02:55.890> block<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.550> let's<00:02:56.820> place<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.750> Polish

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
the rule block and let's place a Polish

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.160 
the rule block and let's place a Polish
granite<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.820> now<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.180> three<00:03:00.450> changes<00:03:00.840> done

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
granite so now I have three changes done

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.080 
granite so now I have three changes done
so<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.890> should<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.070> three<00:03:02.550> different<00:03:02.730> save

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so there should be three different save

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.440 
so there should be three different save
States<00:03:03.390> now<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:05.970> house<00:03:06.180> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
States now you can see on this house I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.480 
States now you can see on this house I
now<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.230> command<00:03:07.620> block<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.280> will

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
now have a command block and a will

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.960 
now have a command block and a will
block<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.620> house<00:03:10.830> over<00:03:11.070> there<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.460> has<00:03:11.640> just

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
block this house over there now has just

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.310 
block this house over there now has just
a<00:03:12.090> command<00:03:12.360> block<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> other<00:03:12.840> house<00:03:13.080> will

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
a command block and the other house will

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.750 
a command block and the other house will
have<00:03:13.470> nothing<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.550> what<00:03:14.670> actually

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
have nothing on it so what actually

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
have nothing on it so what actually
happens<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.450> as<00:03:15.660> soon<00:03:15.690> as<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.990> drink<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.320> undo

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
happens is as soon as I drink the undo

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.340 
happens is as soon as I drink the undo
potion<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.910> house<00:03:18.150> gets<00:03:18.480> cloned<00:03:18.780> onto<00:03:19.140> this

house<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:22.290> house<00:03:22.500> gets<00:03:22.710> cloned<00:03:22.980> into

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
house and this house gets cloned into

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.800 
house and this house gets cloned into
both<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.700> these<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:23.970> houses

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170 

so<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.900> soon<00:03:32.019> as<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.319> some<00:03:32.500> block<00:03:32.680> updates

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
so as soon as you do some block updates

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.580 
so as soon as you do some block updates
cloning<00:03:34.180> happens<00:03:34.510> from<00:03:34.840> left<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.140> right<00:03:35.379> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
cloning happens from left to right and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.000 
cloning happens from left to right and
then<00:03:35.829> if<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.280> undo<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.090> damage<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:38.620> cloning

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
then if you undo the damage the cloning

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.160 
then if you undo the damage the cloning
occurs<00:03:39.400> from<00:03:39.579> right<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.819> left<00:03:39.939> so<00:03:40.359> that's<00:03:40.989> how

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
occurs from right to left so that's how

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.929 
occurs from right to left so that's how
it<00:03:41.260> really<00:03:41.379> works<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:42.430> pretty<00:03:42.609> complicated

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
it really works it's pretty complicated

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.250 
it really works it's pretty complicated
it<00:03:43.299> might<00:03:43.420> be<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> little<00:03:43.599> bit<00:03:43.750> confusing<00:03:44.049> if

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
it might be a little bit confusing if

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.619 
it might be a little bit confusing if
you<00:03:44.290> didn't<00:03:44.890> make<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.159> butter<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.790> can<00:03:46.420> assure

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
you didn't make this butter I can assure

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.330 
you didn't make this butter I can assure
you<00:03:46.659> that<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.140> safe<00:03:47.590> concept<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.250> it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
you that this is a safe concept and it

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.550 
you that this is a safe concept and it
works<00:03:48.459> out<00:03:48.579> 100%<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.840> that's<00:03:50.079> really<00:03:50.200> how<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
works out 100% so that's really how it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.929 
works out 100% so that's really how it
works<00:03:50.590> it's<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.129> little<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.370> confusing<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.909> I

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
works it's a little bit confusing but I

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.280 
works it's a little bit confusing but I
hope<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.209> enjoyed<00:03:52.420> this<00:03:52.540> concept<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.140> think

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
hope you enjoyed this concept I think

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.690 
hope you enjoyed this concept I think
it's<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> really<00:03:53.859> neat<00:03:54.010> concept<00:03:54.189> and<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.609> you

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
it's a really neat concept and if you

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.399 
it's a really neat concept and if you
did<00:03:54.909> make<00:03:55.420> sure<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.569> leave<00:03:55.659> a<00:03:55.930> like<00:03:56.200> and
