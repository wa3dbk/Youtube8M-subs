00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.689
 main battle of the evening so had probably 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 least expected both ladies and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 mens impartial of the caring 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 mister aliens clever is the fight 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 distance ten rounds I'm sure ten 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.410
 Round three minutes heavyweight that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 limit the class plus 90.72 kilograms 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.180
 my ladies and gentlemen applaud her 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.180
 to the fighters they applaud meixner 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.500
 that is what we are talking about 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.199
 so right now when boxing tv because 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 the first two main fighters over the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:10.200
 both cel shading went against it as well 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.960
 even over the full distance because of that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.820
 so are the two hours eurosport 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.030
 when the time is over and we are live 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.939
 with ruslan chagaev against mike 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.159
 sheppard is the ex world champion 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.159
 directly aggressive go against shepherd 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.600
 if you just saw the fight 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 so let and read from us 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 although of course further back 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.600
 Heavyweight is here necessarily 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600
 presented another tempo 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.130
 otherwise very determined from the beginning was so 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.450
 a little question mark behind his 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.970
 efficiency goes barking 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 it only slips not first 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.610
 precipitation thus rates ruslan 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.510
 Chagayev efficiency in his 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.870
 recent appearances seemed rather 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.660
 say friendly 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.820
 mixed performance here wants to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.420
 show each case at the beginning where 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.709
 the hammer hangs and lies very much 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.709
 aggressive and offensive going on 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.750
 the last time that student on the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 left hand more accurate with footrest 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.680
 not completely out of order at home 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.390
 better ghana that 's it over so 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.459
 unlike just sony sanders as 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.200
 before 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.090
 in the case of camping are some here 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.690
 faster if what many expected 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.269
 had 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.209
 aydin and so let that show now 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.950
 Here Chagaev the euro sport brings 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.239
 with the earlier set but beautiful 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.920
 the more beautiful for us that we say 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:14.260
 if you can now with that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.370
 friend from america not so good 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.910
 my can and say there has been neat 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.910
 gescheppert beat the tradition 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 exact 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.130
 You have to say that in Russia 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.390
 impressively, he answers 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.400
 after being last in december 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.140
 actually would have against Jacob's room on 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.560
 Boxing should take place at an event 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.099
 storm box promotion then did not show up 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 the question marks got through before 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.690
 the mixed benefits already 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.550
 were always drawn 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.830
 larger and did not know he comes 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.930
 even know it again 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.480
 it's him he's back and is 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.730
 Of course, my ladies and gentlemen have long ago 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.370
 we do not necessarily have an advantage 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.010
 the biggest one could still be 35 seconds 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.709
 the verdict in the first round 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:24.720
 and the victory goes that you just have to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:29.530
 so deliver and say hat off 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.960
 Congratulation to Russia really too soon 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.210
 say 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.580
 Immediately after this fight he is back 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.580
 the big deal, at least 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.200
 is it an exclamation point? 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.840
 course, double strong exclamation point 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.820
 After that , the arge had problems 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.830
 king live 'also read about it right 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.120
 arrange so mike sheppard and live 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.760
 leave because she has not the same 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 caliber lawn came here 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.120
 undefeated
