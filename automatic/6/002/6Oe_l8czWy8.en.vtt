00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.570
 Jalloh continues 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.740
 "I have my little preview for you and that off 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.220
 I've ever had the trend that percent venture kick would come then 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.589
 start new world 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.160
 that has delayed her a bit now 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.889
 to have 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.140
 I am already one or the other show what this has planned for the future 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.349
 and 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.189
 the first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 that I have planned here we will also have a look today 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.080
 while that is 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.780
 this construction their the gardens of our new world in one 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 Theater in the center 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 you are sure to ask yourself now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.290
 what that should be if you do not know yet read this is not 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 my invention Ben for more dollars 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.330
 not only then means simply unclear 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.310
 They look at what changes have built down 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 d 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 m Scheer 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 Krugman 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.180
 Minseln 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 the sense that you can not really do that much but can change it very quickly 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.870
 mm therefore father though light seems at the latest now that is one 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.230
 Fashion show 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.730
 one of them 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.530
 because after that do not have to constantly run down to our victim 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 No, the moz are coming up to us 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.120
 we can easily handle those in our squad 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 Century reaches percent now to the main building could then easily 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.180
 Collect the things 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.600
 Drop opponents 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 the transmitter of a lift 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.480
 around the swords Hollich 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.869
 around 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.550
 and channel in this video link with that explains exactly how that 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.179
 is working 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.749
 nervous 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.959
 it is a total of percent of all videos divided 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.009
 around 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.289
 Wendrich is interested in watching the tugs for free but definitely 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.289
 do not do a tutorial 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 or at least not yet 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.089
 and we can quickly collect deeper or destroy it that way 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.789
 easy 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.509
 do not have to collect 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.509
 Sam then we stand here again 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.769
 and I would say 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 Let's see the effect of this one 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.829
 you've seen it was one percent, in any case, only a single Taylor he 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.289
 do not have me 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.690
 but 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.780
 on 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.369
 9 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.859
 the professional and technical construction I have got it 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.769
 just done 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.100
 here 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.100
 Sleep fast 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.589
 because on the 7th 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.039
 and betrayed 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.779
 9 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:32.690
 we'll see 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.069
 I do not know if you can see that but there is a lot down below 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 Price you can recognize the number of a video 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.619
 but 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:51.359
 no soon bets will hear something of this monster coming from 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.869
 then we can get these monsters 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.609
 he has always been the agreement 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.899
 where the weather is 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.889
 a spider 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.509
 and see that 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.509
 he is driven up the spider 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.909
 that is why Rosberg must be able to drive air 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.650
 and the effect is relatively simple 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.740
 for dying at the moment 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.659
 St 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 Now let's have a look 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.389
 Cologne the advantage of this whole story now is the 4 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.240
 so that for the first building we are all women 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.830
 or the first picture in the new world ranking list and as you can see 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 comes out of it properly 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.300
 it is now getting new buoyancy 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800
 and for one 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.949
 the 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.900
 Percent designer Laible around our on base 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.189
 and from there 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.170
 will be the then 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.159
 smother 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.169
 March lasts a bit until the next ones arrive 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.360
 Tel 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 yes is because again the left turn 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.879
 Spindelegger 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.159
 Mondays are already the next yes that's quite fast, everything runs without 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.349
 further one sees me b 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.529
 on 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.699
 comes cook has quite nicely yield server 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.610
 the percent 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.790
 so will commute with the time that the whole thing runs smoothly 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.360
 Say that come here one by one die and when the die completely from 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.180
 below again the next 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.830
 then get going again and so on 50 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.870
 an endless stream ended up landing this value 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:02.979
 It may be that between great dinners the advantage is better 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:10.589
 simply we shares this bandaged now as the first project for example 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.319
 all around in Surwold 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.749
 the money wants to go how can we easily get lost each time quickly 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:21.319
 what's there and pick it up 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.370
 then we build the next one in between Laufenburger the previous week 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.339
 not clear 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.829
 that's really as good as always there 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.810
 We have a long way to be shown cities 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.880
 We have everything going down right in the house 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.389
 through the practical matter 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.259
 - SanDisk Bonn advise and it is also quite good 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.539
 and here 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.279
 as I said I'm right that there are still things that show here 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.240
 with their new world 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.699
 until then 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.970
 Nevertheless, Gerhard Bulger was a bit on the go 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:11.820
 so prepare 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.470
 It is we see each other until the next time Jena
