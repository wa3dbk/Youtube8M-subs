00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.709 

how<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.870> doing<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> an<00:00:10.860> icon<00:00:11.280> 70<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.090> 300

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
how you doing this is an icon 70 to 300

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.740 
how you doing this is an icon 70 to 300
millimeter<00:00:13.230> F<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:13.910> 5.6<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.210> 70

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
millimeter F or 5.6 I'm at 70

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.500 
millimeter F or 5.6 I'm at 70
millimeters<00:00:16.350> right<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:17.000> this<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> moon

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
millimeters right now this is the moon

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
millimeters right now this is the moon
you're<00:00:18.930> looking<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> zoom<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
you're looking at I want to zoom in and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630 
you're looking at I want to zoom in and
show<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> looks<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.890> 300

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
show you what it looks like at 300

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
show you what it looks like at 300
millimeters<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.539> then<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
millimeters and then we're going to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.890 
millimeters and then we're going to
digitally<00:00:25.740> zoom<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.939> software<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
digitally zoom in with the software on a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
digitally zoom in with the software on a
computer<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.310> close<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:30.090> get

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
computer just see how close we can get

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
computer just see how close we can get
and<00:00:30.510> clear<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.230> we're<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> work<00:00:31.980> our<00:00:32.160> way

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and clear so we're going to work our way

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.020 
and clear so we're going to work our way
up<00:00:32.369> here<00:00:39.980> that's<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> hundred<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
up here that's about a hundred and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.240 
up here that's about a hundred and
thirty<00:00:42.540> five<00:00:42.840> millimeters<00:00:45.230> that's<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.559> 200

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
thirty five millimeters that's about 200

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.189 
thirty five millimeters that's about 200
that's<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.969> 300<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.840> I'll<00:00:51.960> go

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that's all the way at 300 now I'll go

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
that's all the way at 300 now I'll go
ahead<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.680> start<00:00:53.100> zooming<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.699> in

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
ahead and start zooming this in

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.240 
ahead and start zooming this in
digitally<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> we'll<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.620> happens<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
digitally and we'll see what happens and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.000 
digitally and we'll see what happens and
I'm<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> take<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> picture<00:00:57.239> too<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'm going to take a picture too and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
I'm going to take a picture too and
let's<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.489> clear<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.829> get<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
let's just see how clear we can get a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.600 
let's just see how clear we can get a
shot<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> moon<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.710> see<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.010> looks<00:01:05.250> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
shot of the moon and see how it looks so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.590 
shot of the moon and see how it looks so
it's<00:01:06.360> basically<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.110> test<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.600> lens

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it's basically just a test of the lens

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's basically just a test of the lens
itself<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> Nikon<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.430> running<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> Nikon

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
itself on a Nikon I'm running on a Nikon

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.280 
itself on a Nikon I'm running on a Nikon
d50<00:01:13.409> 100<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:17.180> VR<00:01:18.180> lens<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
d50 100 and this is the VR lens of the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:39.450 
d50 100 and this is the VR lens of the
vibration<00:01:19.920> reduction

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.090 

well<00:01:40.150> if<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.570> hear<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.930> dumber<00:01:41.410> damn

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
well if you can hear that dumber damn

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.190 
well if you can hear that dumber damn
coyotes<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:46.600> now<00:01:46.720> I'm<00:01:46.780> going<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:46.960> go<00:01:47.080> ahead

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
coyotes right now I'm going to go ahead

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.150 
coyotes right now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:47.440> take<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.620> picture<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:50.010> see<00:01:51.010> how

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
and take a picture of it and see how

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.980 
and take a picture of it and see how
well<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.700> comes<00:01:52.030> out<00:01:52.440> zooming<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.620> digitally

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
well that comes out zooming in digitally

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.480 
well that comes out zooming in digitally
I'm<00:01:55.990> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.230> do<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.470> picture<00:01:56.800> at<00:01:56.950> 300

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
I'm going to do the picture at 300

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:17.310 
I'm going to do the picture at 300
millimeters

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.720 

there<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.590> pretty<00:02:19.190> impressed<00:02:19.580> with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
there you have it pretty impressed with

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.230 
there you have it pretty impressed with
this<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:21.170> well<00:02:21.500> worth<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.340> money<00:02:22.790> of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
this it's well worth the the money of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.780 
this it's well worth the the money of
autofocus<00:02:24.110> works<00:02:24.290> great<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.370> during

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
autofocus works great on this during

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.940 
autofocus works great on this during
daylight<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.960> course<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:29.230> got<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.740> power

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
daylight of course and I got a to power

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.620 
daylight of course and I got a to power
teleconverter<00:02:31.850> I'm<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.240> put<00:02:32.360> another

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
teleconverter I'm going to put another

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.610 
teleconverter I'm going to put another
video<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:35.990> we<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> little

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
video on and see if we can get a little

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.490 
video on and see if we can get a little
closer<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.390> stuff<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:39.110> there<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.130> it
