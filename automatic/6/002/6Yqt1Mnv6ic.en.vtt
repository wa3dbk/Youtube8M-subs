SW you can download it here if you don't

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.759 
SW you can download it here if you don't
have<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.510> if<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.110> have<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.410> then<00:03:33.680> you're

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
have it if you do have it then you're

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.770 
have it if you do have it then you're
just<00:03:33.830> going<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.040> browse<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.580> point<00:03:35.390> straight

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
just going to browse and point straight

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.539 
just going to browse and point straight
to<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.590> already<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.100> my<00:03:37.220> desktop

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
to it so I already have it on my desktop

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.530 
to it so I already have it on my desktop
here<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.060> here<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.080> 6.1.3<00:03:40.060> click<00:03:41.060> open<00:03:41.450> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
here and here it is 6.1.3 click open and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.229 
here and here it is 6.1.3 click open and
now<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.500> going<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.739> verify<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.239> IPSW

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
now it's going to verify the IPSW

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.840 
now it's going to verify the IPSW
alright<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:44.930> now<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.200> just<00:03:45.440> click<00:03:45.560> build<00:03:45.950> IPSW

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
alright so now we just click build IPSW

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.090 
alright so now we just click build IPSW
so<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:48.019> doing<00:03:48.049> is<00:03:48.380> actually<00:03:48.560> taking

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
so what this is doing is actually taking

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.699 
so what this is doing is actually taking
the<00:03:49.220> IPSW<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.120> we<00:03:50.209> point<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.049> using

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
the IPSW that we point it to and using

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.330 
the IPSW that we point it to and using
those<00:03:51.919> sh-sh<00:03:52.730> blobs<00:03:53.060> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
those sh-sh blobs to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.850 
those sh-sh blobs to
sign<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.879> IPSW<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.290> if<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.500> didn't<00:03:56.830> know

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
sign the IPSW so if you didn't know

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.470 
sign the IPSW so if you didn't know
Apple<00:03:57.790> stop<00:03:58.030> signing<00:03:58.360> iOS<00:03:59.110> 6.1.3<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
Apple stop signing iOS 6.1.3 and

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.869 
Apple stop signing iOS 6.1.3 and
everything<00:04:02.260> previous<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.280> well<00:04:03.550> and

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
everything previous to that is well and

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.050 
everything previous to that is well and
it<00:04:04.450> only<00:04:04.599> signs<00:04:05.019> iOS<00:04:05.530> 7<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.459> doesn't<00:04:06.819> allow

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
it only signs iOS 7 so it doesn't allow

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.600 
it only signs iOS 7 so it doesn't allow
you<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.390> downgrade<00:04:07.629> whatsoever<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.340> what<00:04:09.519> this

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
you to downgrade whatsoever so what this

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.490 
you to downgrade whatsoever so what this
is<00:04:09.760> going<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:09.970> do<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.330> make<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.930> signed

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
is going to do is make a signed

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.670 
is going to do is make a signed
IPSW<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.849> way<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.299> tricks<00:04:13.660> iTunes<00:04:14.200> into

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
IPSW that way it tricks iTunes into

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.800 
IPSW that way it tricks iTunes into
thinking<00:04:15.069> apples<00:04:15.430> actually<00:04:15.849> signing<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.389> when

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
thinking apples actually signing it when

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.479 
thinking apples actually signing it when
it's<00:04:16.959> not<00:04:17.139> but<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.949> works<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> our<00:04:18.370> advantage

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
it's not but it works to our advantage

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.430 
it's not but it works to our advantage
so<00:04:19.090> we'll<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.389> able<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.630> downgrade<00:04:19.870> back<00:04:20.290> to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
so we'll be able to downgrade back to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.250 
so we'll be able to downgrade back to
6.1.3<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:22.120> this<00:04:22.330> takes<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.690> while<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.110> I'll

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
6.1.3 now this takes a while so I'll

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:32.760 
6.1.3 now this takes a while so I'll
just<00:04:23.410> go<00:04:23.530> ahead<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.830> speed<00:04:24.100> right<00:04:24.310> through<00:04:24.550> it

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.200 

all<00:04:33.770> right<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.039> now<00:04:34.220> we<00:04:34.280> have<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.550> pop-up<00:04:34.909> that
