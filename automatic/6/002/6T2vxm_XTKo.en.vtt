00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.040
Welcome back, for the Pumpkin Cane you
need Fimo Effect 404 orange transparent

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.780
and noctilucent. Also, I have used normal
black and green. The tools I used are

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490
knives and Clay Machine.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:53.380
I create the gradient, for that I'll take the
Fimo 404 and noctilucent. At Level 1 of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:02.520
the clay machine, the polymer clay will
pressed as long as a nice gradient can be

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.440
seen.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.940
I extend the gradient. For this purpose I
press the gradient through the machine,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.650
from level 1 to 7

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.590
Roll the polymer clay to a 15 centimeter
sausage and cut out five equal pieces.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.480
The four outer parts are bent with the
fingers. These are then wrapped around

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.640
the center piece.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.110
With a flexible blade you need to cut the
pumpkin in to get the space for eyes and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.610
mouth. The black polymer clay I pressed
at level 9 through the Clay Machine.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.470
With the back of a knife you now manage
some space for the green of the pumpkin.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.020
If you bake the finished cane in the oven I
promise you that your halloween

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.450
pumpkin lights in the dark.
