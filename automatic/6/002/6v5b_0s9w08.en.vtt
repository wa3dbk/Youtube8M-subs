every point of view as a point of view

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.150 
every point of view as a point of view
worth<00:04:07.700> listening<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:09.859> is<00:04:10.010> really

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
worth listening to and this is really

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.490 
worth listening to and this is really
something<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:11.180> strongly<00:04:11.959> believe<00:04:12.049> it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
something that I I strongly believe it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.670 
something that I I strongly believe it
and<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.799> think<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.099> has<00:04:13.220> out<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.230> some<00:04:15.440> sense

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
and I think it has out so the some sense

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.789 
and I think it has out so the some sense
my<00:04:15.889> style<00:04:16.250> is<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.729> sit<00:04:17.599> down<00:04:17.810> even<00:04:18.650> though<00:04:18.769> I

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
my style is to sit down even though I

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.129 
my style is to sit down even though I
may<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.310> very<00:04:19.639> clear<00:04:20.269> idea<00:04:20.329> in<00:04:20.750> my<00:04:20.930> own

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
may have a very clear idea in my own

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.690 
may have a very clear idea in my own
mind<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:23.410> about<00:04:24.410> about<00:04:24.919> an<00:04:25.099> issue<00:04:25.250> on<00:04:25.430> how<00:04:25.639> to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
mind that about about an issue on how to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.839 
mind that about about an issue on how to
proceed<00:04:26.060> with<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.599> but<00:04:27.139> i<00:04:27.410> tend<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.070> actually

proceed with it but i tend to actually

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.890 
proceed with it but i tend to actually
sit<00:04:29.060> down

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
sit down

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.920

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
is what the leader thinks the answer

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.570 
is what the leader thinks the answer
should<00:04:47.389> be<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:48.680> let<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.100> side<00:04:49.400> come

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
should be and then let that side come

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.790 
should be and then let that side come
from<00:04:49.759> different<00:04:49.940> perspective<00:04:50.690> but<00:04:51.289> then<00:04:51.560> as

from different perspective but then as

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.400 
from different perspective but then as
the<00:04:52.550> leader<00:04:52.759> you<00:04:53.389> are<00:04:53.419> accountable<00:04:54.080> for<00:04:54.320> the

the leader you are accountable for the
final<00:04:54.740> decision<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.430> make<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.759> final

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
final decision so you make the final

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.999 
final decision so you make the final
decision<00:04:56.240> but<00:04:56.930> then<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.229> feel<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.800> are

decision but then you feel that you are

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.969 
decision but then you feel that you are

the optimal solution I think the

as the greatest asset of York University
the<00:05:53.449> greatest<00:05:53.870> asset<00:05:54.289> is<00:05:54.409> the<00:05:55.370> diversity<00:05:55.699> of

the greatest asset is the diversity of

the greatest asset is the diversity of
the<00:05:55.970> people<00:05:56.289> York<00:05:57.289> is<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:58.220> most<00:05:58.430> diverse

the students and faculty will come from
over<00:06:06.169> 155<00:06:07.039> countries<00:06:07.729> in<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.120> world<00:06:08.270> we<00:06:08.690> are

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
over 155 countries in the world we are

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.450 
over 155 countries in the world we are
trying<00:06:09.320> to<00:06:09.530> leverage<00:06:09.710> that<00:06:09.979> in<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:10.340> many

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
trying to leverage that in so many

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.080 
trying to leverage that in so many
different<00:06:10.699> ways<00:06:11.680> we<00:06:12.680> are<00:06:12.800> using<00:06:13.039> this<00:06:13.370> as<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.639> as

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
different ways we are using this as a as

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.820 
different ways we are using this as a as
a<00:06:14.150> leverage<00:06:14.659> in<00:06:14.870> order<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.229> reach<00:06:15.320> out<00:06:15.530> to<00:06:15.740> the

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
a leverage in order to reach out to the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.700 
a leverage in order to reach out to the
world<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:16.880> we<00:06:17.060> are<00:06:17.180> really<00:06:17.539> working<00:06:17.720> on<00:06:18.260> a<00:06:18.289> very

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
world so we are really working on a very

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.200 
world so we are really working on a very
ambitious<00:06:19.389> plan<00:06:20.389> for<00:06:20.750> internationalization

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
ambitious plan for internationalization

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.510 
ambitious plan for internationalization
any<00:06:23.210> entity<00:06:23.960> with<00:06:24.320> a<00:06:24.380> population<00:06:24.979> like<00:06:25.310> this

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
any entity with a population like this

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.399 
any entity with a population like this
with<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.849> diversity<00:06:26.360> of<00:06:26.389> that<00:06:26.570> population<00:06:26.840> I

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
with the diversity of that population I

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.000 
with the diversity of that population I
think<00:06:27.979> this<00:06:28.250> is<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.580> surreal<00:06:28.880> strength<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:30.860> I

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
think this is the surreal strength and I

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.820 
think this is the surreal strength and I
think<00:06:31.310> this<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:31.610> what<00:06:32.120> will<00:06:32.330> make<00:06:32.630> this<00:06:33.139> city

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
think this is what will make this city

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.399 
think this is what will make this city
and<00:06:34.099> this<00:06:34.130> university<00:06:35.060> continue<00:06:35.539> to<00:06:35.659> be<00:06:35.810> great

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
and this university continue to be great
