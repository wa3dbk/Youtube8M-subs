00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.359
 the news on sunday meat from the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.950
 printer what you sound absolutely crazy 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.360
 is actually the idea of ​​some us 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.460
 scientist which is to take us in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.349
 in your opinion final step 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 against mass animal husbandry and animal 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.600
 found slaughtering 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 meat from the printer fuck yeah rivva 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 to the idea and the technology itself 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.600
 hide behind it are in principle 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.949
 meat in a 3d printer's that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 whole then probably somehow in shape 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.179
 brings out different fibers 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 to construct the procedure together 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.110
 it comes from the medicine itself 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 used for example new skin 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.980
 For burn victims I reconstruct 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 that's exactly where it belongs but also 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 The company that does that has become now 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 We think about the edible 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 printer meat adolf gardt certainly 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 is the animal welfare thought here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 Of course, the climate is also thought 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 but I think we pull ourselves in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 our society today 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.940
 enough artificial shit in and if 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.649
 I imagine that my juicy 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.329
 Assign burger for the yes of the bio 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 beef can buy and his server 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.629
 slaughtered happily in the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.210
 beef only metro of fiber 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.189
 or plant fibers or whatever 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 there and then all of the printer 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:19.200
 but comes moment when I almost 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.780
 perfectly imitated of real meat 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 from a 3d printer that gets me that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 even in shape brings depending on how 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.890
 I want that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.689
 okay, honestly who thinks of you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.960
 right now also not let to citizens 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.350
 revolutionizing the pop industry 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.479
 a lot for youtube okay what do you think of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.500
 this bio ink printer meat is that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.270
 whole just a business idea 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 somehow getting coal again 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 it is actually the alternative to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.369
 apart from that we need animal husbandry 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.380
 as people in our diet 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.430
 animal amino acids or otherwise 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.549
 after that we all know each other again 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.149
 top damn ax we have thumbs up 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.470
 or thumb 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.670
 This can be a video revs up 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.990
 give one has however at the at the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.579
 the thumbs are also the fingers with 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.820
 You can type in internet pages 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.690
 and when we are 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.780
 on the subject of the internet he is thank you then 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.270
 Let's talk about the current one 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.790
 Project of the EU speak out in the fight against 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 The crime is to browser and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.810
 Internet provider personal data 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.459
 and activities in the network at your customer 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.930
 record and save in the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.880
 drafts of the project are named under 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.770
 other words that this clean it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.690
 eu would be necessary for the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.790
 terrorist use of the internet 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.830
 restrict and the illegal 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.170
 Use of the Internet to combat 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.810
 Markets as download will still be 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.150
 formulated harder and fought for as none 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.070
 clueless people are blowing up in the air 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.690
 I will never understand the privacy 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.489
 on the internet went with this step 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.160
 Definitely lost that 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.260
 save all data and activities in the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.390
 net as well as the password query on 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.790
 personal could and for example 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.170
 social networks yes yes that makes 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.600
 see especially in the fight against terrorism 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.269
 because he terrorists all their actions 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.790
 plan on facebook a facebook 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.070
 north or commuter has me too 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.540
 event moment party in the airplane 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
 invited home 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.140
 the battle 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.760
 my interpretation of one 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.190
 Hungarian-Austrian terrorists 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.960
 bremen just will not get a clinic 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.920
 it should also be possible that 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.510
 city ​​authorities or 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.610
 law enforcement agencies 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.860
 remove content from the internet or 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.600
 for whole countries, the further lock 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.400
 the uploads of the users should be controlled 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.590
 be to determine and hold 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.110
 Who's what content online available 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.570
 puts that is then almost the total 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.980
 Surveillance becomes the torch 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.020
 What do you mean ? 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 justified or possibly so strong 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.780
 control so much narrow down clearly 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.860
 I understand such approaches 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.600
 for example, when fighting against 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.980
 child pornography that I support 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.830
 also full but it is because of that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.330
 put everyone right the first time 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.370
 to treat as one 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.810
 this is not a potential criminal offender 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.400
 lawful that would be as if 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.660
 tv stations every gambler as 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.280
 amokläufer represent 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.480
 I would be happy in any case 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.770
 if we have your opinion in the 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 comments, whoever of you still writes 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.620
 want more information or needs 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.000
 Articles like all other information too 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.470
 in the video description so I still 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.550
 a little update for all gamers under 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.290
 us and that this is not 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.270
 personally very happy is the 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.200
 black ops 2 is getting closer and closer 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.450
 it is even more reason 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.430
 many of you are looking forward to it 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.109
 know the zombie fashion outlook on 1 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.640
 the man a little real quasi 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.709
 bounded arenas as long as possible 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.479
 survived or just not when you 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.620
 a character until I personally 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.060
 It's all a bit fun 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.680
 small and tight those of you who 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.590
 now come to tear many jokes again 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.479
 in the black ops 2 is now fully in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.880
 the direction of us zombie fans if he 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.560
 new song cinema is the hammer huge 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.030
 levels with a kind of christian strike 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.950
 system that is known from games like 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.440
 for example, left for dead 2 and the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.729
 remote even story will be based on it 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.930
 goes even further 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.100
 not yet officially confirmed 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.410
 According to reports, it should be possible 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.300

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.610

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.380
 campaign in a summer variant too 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.180
 whether that's really true or not 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.310
 if the modding scene is there already in whole 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.900
 great style is tuned and whether the game is in 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.190
 the form at all in ours 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.830

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.030
 terrible about it I like you 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.470
 on the run when I am personally pleased 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.690
 Anyway, it's huge as it is 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.220

 have my social life to a minimum 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.050
