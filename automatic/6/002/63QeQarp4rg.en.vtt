can actually lower pokum and sit here

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:43.099 
can actually lower pokum and sit here
yeah<00:02:36.269> slide<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.480> down

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.080 

you've<00:02:44.109> got<00:02:44.349> your<00:02:45.090> spring-loaded<00:02:46.090> hook<00:02:46.870> for

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you've got your spring-loaded hook for

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:08.210 
you've got your spring-loaded hook for
additional<00:02:49.090> support<00:02:49.510> wait

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.010 

the<00:03:08.760> ball<00:03:09.000> head<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:10.790> stiff<00:03:11.840> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
the ball head is stiff going to the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.930 
the ball head is stiff going to the
right<00:03:13.200> that's<00:03:16.190> step<00:03:17.190> four<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.550> right<00:03:17.700> than

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
right that's step four on the right than

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.180 
right that's step four on the right than
on<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.060> left<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.600> think<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:19.800> because<00:03:19.980> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
on the left I think that's because I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:35.490 
on the left I think that's because I
hadn't<00:03:20.490> opened<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.330> all<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.630> way

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.470 

play<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.709> slide<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.489> out<00:03:40.330> seems<00:03:41.330> like

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
play can slide in and out seems like

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.649 
play can slide in and out seems like
it's<00:03:41.629> made<00:03:41.810> out<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:43.090> head<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.209> made<00:03:44.420> out<00:03:44.510> of

it's made out of a head is made out of
aluminum<00:03:45.700> rather<00:03:46.700> sturdy<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.549> has<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
aluminum rather sturdy so it has it you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.390 
aluminum rather sturdy so it has it you
just<00:03:54.920> need<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.190> screw<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.549> on<00:04:00.340> anyway<00:04:01.340> so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
just need to screw that on anyway so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.270 
just need to screw that on anyway so
that's<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.239> BK<00:04:02.569> five<00:04:02.900> five<00:04:03.140> five<00:04:03.349> travel

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
later as to how sturdy it is the legs

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:10.180 
later as to how sturdy it is the legs
extended<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.930> extension<00:05:09.530> seems<00:05:09.770> rather

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
extended the extension seems rather

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.820 
extended the extension seems rather
fluid<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.720> I'm<00:05:14.870> slightly<00:05:15.170> concerned<00:05:15.530> over

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
fluid so I'm slightly concerned over

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.650 
fluid so I'm slightly concerned over
this<00:05:18.830> section<00:05:19.100> here<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.610> looks<00:05:20.390> rather

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
this section here and looks rather

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.940 
this section here and looks rather
plastic<00:05:21.610> we'll<00:05:22.610> see<00:05:22.760> how<00:05:22.880> long<00:05:23.470> port<00:05:24.470> breaks

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
plastic we'll see how long port breaks

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:34.420 
plastic we'll see how long port breaks
that's<00:05:25.340> where<00:05:25.520> my<00:05:25.640> last<00:05:25.850> cheap<00:05:26.180> tripod<00:05:26.480> failed

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.930
