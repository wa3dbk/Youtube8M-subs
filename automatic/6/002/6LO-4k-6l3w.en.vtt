 to have this trick is to skate as I am 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.380
 watching the screen to have a wall 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 Lisa is looking for a smooth wall 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.870
 where are we going to go to put on the wall 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.270
 give r1 for coverage and start 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.730
 hit the left joystick towards the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 left quickly as you see there in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710

 outside is that we are 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.050
 we are sliding downhill 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.020
 pretty do at the beginning you have to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.710
 take the report the trick but 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.510
 good at the end at the end of everything 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 it goes pretty well and it's a trick that 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.880
 it takes 10 minutes to do it 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 we have easy go 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.259

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:28.119
 now I believe - and sliding around doing what 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:30.280
 that used to be coverage and quickly 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.170
 with the joystick and we have to tell 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.299
 more or less a second clack clack 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.409

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.969
