00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
some desk base as you can see but I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269

don't<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> most<00:00:28.019> space<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> world

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
don't have the most space in the world

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.179 
don't have the most space in the world
and<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.630> me<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:31.830> my<00:00:31.949> Vita

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
here since I got a little bit more room

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
here since I got a little bit more room
and<00:00:34.710> whatnot<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:37.820> they<00:00:38.820> were<00:00:38.940> saying<00:00:39.210> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and whatnot what they were saying this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.350 
and whatnot what they were saying this
is<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.870> much<00:00:39.989> bigger<00:00:40.200> than<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.680> old<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.360> I'll

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
is so much bigger than the old one I'll

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.430 
is so much bigger than the old one I'll
get<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> old<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:45.890> show<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> comparison

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
get the old one show you the comparison

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
get the old one show you the comparison
on<00:00:49.670> top<00:00:55.010> because<00:00:56.010> nobody<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.210> something

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
on top because nobody would do something

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
on top because nobody would do something
similar<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.430> was<00:01:00.090> looking<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
similar to this so I was looking on the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.200 
similar to this so I was looking on the
internet<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> never<00:01:01.260> found<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.920> video<00:01:02.210> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
internet I never found a video in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.560 
internet I never found a video in
comparison<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.799> I'm<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.280> sure<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
comparison and I'm not sure by the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.760 
comparison and I'm not sure by the
camera<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.710> exactly<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:09.770> there

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
camera you can see it exactly but there

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700 
camera you can see it exactly but there
are<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:11.820> slightly<00:01:12.390> bigger<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.590> not

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
are it's just slightly bigger it's not

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.039 
are it's just slightly bigger it's not
like<00:01:13.890> huge<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.210> say<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.830> Razer

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
like huge like say I think the Razer

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.300 
like huge like say I think the Razer
Goliath<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:20.369> full<00:01:20.640> desk<00:01:22.189> but<00:01:23.189> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
Goliath which is like full desk but it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
Goliath which is like full desk but it
cuts<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.700> right<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cuts out right in there and it's just

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
cuts out right in there and it's just
like<00:01:25.590> vaguely<00:01:27.350> larger<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.180> portion<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
like vaguely larger and this portion and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.950 
like vaguely larger and this portion and
the<00:01:30.780> corners<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:32.310> nothing<00:01:32.729> huge<00:01:34.460> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.610> can

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
the corners it's nothing huge if you can

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
the corners it's nothing huge if you can
actually<00:01:36.960> make<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.869> uh<00:01:41.570> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
actually make that out and uh my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.139 
actually make that out and uh my
not-so-great<00:01:43.140> webcam<00:01:45.680> but<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.820> pretty

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
not-so-great webcam but that is pretty

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
not-so-great webcam but that is pretty
much<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.380> somebody<00:01:49.710> else

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
