00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.119 
you just don't know if you can kind of
just<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:24.170> flexible<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:27.019> can<00:02:27.650> feel<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
just gonna do flexible I can feel the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.970 
just gonna do flexible I can feel the
tail<00:02:28.400> kind<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:28.910> move<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.329> little<00:02:29.650> before<00:02:30.650> even

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
tail kind of move a little before even

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.240 
tail kind of move a little before even
like<00:02:31.220> comes<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.829> probably<00:02:33.829> just<00:02:34.069> took<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
like comes up and probably just took a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.780 
like comes up and probably just took a
shot<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.579> you<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:37.340> oh<00:02:39.129> no<00:02:40.129> it's<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.489> not<00:02:40.640> as

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
shot of you but oh no it's just not as

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.680 
shot of you but oh no it's just not as
stiff<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.239> I'd<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:42.380> be<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:43.690> can't

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
stiff as I'd like it to be but can't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.640 
stiff as I'd like it to be but can't
weigh<00:02:44.810> down<00:02:44.989> fall<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.500> because<00:02:45.859> her<00:02:47.650> just

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
weigh down fall that because her just

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.979 
weigh down fall that because her just
say<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.799> like<00:02:48.889> that<00:02:48.980> oh<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:50.569> if<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
say it like that oh and if that's a

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.140 
say it like that oh and if that's a
downfall<00:02:51.380> for<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.889> because<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.730> has<00:02:52.940> really

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
downfall for it because it has really

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.449 
downfall for it because it has really
good<00:02:53.329> pop<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.950> wish<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.160> was<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> little

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
good pop I just wish it was a little

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.420 
good pop I just wish it was a little
stiffer<00:02:55.910> like<00:02:56.359> my<00:02:56.599> other<00:02:57.019> deck<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.680> um<00:02:58.609> I've

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
stiffer like my other deck but um I've

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.300 
stiffer like my other deck but um I've
just<00:03:01.430> started<00:03:01.579> doing<00:03:01.989> stairs<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.590> gaps<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
just started doing stairs and gaps and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.089 
just started doing stairs and gaps and
stuff<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.900> hasn't<00:03:06.200> snapped<00:03:06.470> or<00:03:06.739> anything

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
stuff and it hasn't snapped or anything

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.890 
stuff and it hasn't snapped or anything
so<00:03:09.730> guess<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.000> pretty<00:03:11.180> sick<00:03:11.389> deck<00:03:11.630> it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so guess it's a pretty sick deck it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.680 
so guess it's a pretty sick deck it's
the<00:03:12.079> pearlite<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.530> guess<00:03:12.859> that's<00:03:13.099> why<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.690> them

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the pearlite I guess that's why the them

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.089 
the pearlite I guess that's why the them
it<00:03:14.930> might<00:03:15.049> be<00:03:15.200> flexible<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.769> because<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:15.980> that

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
it might be flexible is because of that

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.699 
it might be flexible is because of that
different<00:03:16.519> epoxy<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.030> whatever<00:03:17.299> they<00:03:17.450> use<00:03:17.709> but
