hey there so today's tutorial is going

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.620 
hey there so today's tutorial is going
to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.250> answer<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.910> bit<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.450> riddle

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to be the answer to a bit of a riddle

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.590 
to be the answer to a bit of a riddle
namely<00:00:16.590> right<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.789> POI

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
namely right now I have my POI

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050 
namely right now I have my POI
turning<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> split<00:00:19.680> time<00:00:19.949> same<00:00:20.340> direction<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
turning in split time same direction and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.000 
turning in split time same direction and
as<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.539> they're<00:00:22.320> close<00:00:22.529> enough<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
as you can see they're close enough to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.320 
as you can see they're close enough to
each<00:00:23.189> other<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> poor<00:00:23.910> could<00:00:24.119> cross

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
each other that the poor could cross

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.200 
each other that the poor could cross
over<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:24.869> wanted<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.560> could<00:00:25.980> easily

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
over if they wanted to I could easily

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.990 
over if they wanted to I could easily
tangle<00:00:27.210> if<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.449> wanted<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.760> am

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
tangle if I wanted to but I'm not how am

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
tangle if I wanted to but I'm not how am
i<00:00:30.090> avoiding<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> well<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.040> has<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> do

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
i avoiding this well it all has to do

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.310 
i avoiding this well it all has to do
with<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> concept<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> call<00:00:33.899> poi

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
with the concept that I like to call poi

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.610 
with the concept that I like to call poi
lanes<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.820> when<00:00:36.570> looking<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.380> from

lanes that is when looking at you from

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
lanes that is when looking at you from
the<00:00:37.739> side<00:00:38.070> which<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.239> poised<00:00:39.510> closest<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the side which of your poised closest to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
the side which of your poised closest to
your<00:00:40.230> body<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.780> ahead

and give you guys just a little bit of a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
and give you guys just a little bit of a
bird's-eye<00:00:45.120> demonstration<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
bird's-eye demonstration of what this

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
bird's-eye demonstration of what this
happens<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> mean<00:00:47.780> okay<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:49.260> things

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
happens to mean okay so first things

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.970 
happens to mean okay so first things
first

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
first

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
first
now<00:00:50.430> when<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> stick<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.120> arms<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
now when you stick your arms out in

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.090 
now when you stick your arms out in
front<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.870> your<00:00:52.020> body<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> creating<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
front of your body kind of creating a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
front of your body kind of creating a
little<00:00:53.309> Bowl<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:54.059> you'll<00:00:54.270> notice<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
little Bowl what you'll notice is that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
little Bowl what you'll notice is that
there's<00:00:55.410> essentially<00:00:55.829> two<00:00:55.980> sides<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.239> where

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
there's essentially two sides to where

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
there's essentially two sides to where
an<00:00:57.870> object<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> relation<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> here

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
an object can be in relation to you here

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
an object can be in relation to you here
it<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.210> inside<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> bowl<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.949> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
it can be inside the bowl or it can be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.539 
it can be inside the bowl or it can be
outside<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> bowl<00:01:03.180> yeah<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.339> way<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
outside the bowl yeah and the way the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.010 
outside the bowl yeah and the way the
point<00:01:05.820> move<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.090> no<00:01:06.240> different<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
point move is no different from this you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
point move is no different from this you
could<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> these<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.369> sides<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
could think of these two sides of the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
could think of these two sides of the
bowl<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.240> almost<00:01:09.540> being<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.080> two<00:01:10.350> lanes<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bowl as almost being like two lanes of a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.030 
bowl as almost being like two lanes of a
highway<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
highway right now it could be that the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660 
highway right now it could be that the
poi<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.700> rotating<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> outside<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
poi are rotating on the outside of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
poi are rotating on the outside of the
bowl<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> hand<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> inside<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
bowl for one hand but the inside of the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
bowl for one hand but the inside of the
bowl<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.220> hand<00:01:20.520> let<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.090> show<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
bowl for the other hand let me show you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.620 
bowl for the other hand let me show you
what<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> mean<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> take<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.360> orange

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
what I mean so if I take this orange

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.590 
what I mean so if I take this orange
point<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.549> turning<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
point here I can have it turning in a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
point here I can have it turning in a
position<00:01:27.900> where<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.860> rotating<00:01:29.430> outside<00:01:30.150> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
position where it is rotating outside of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.230 
position where it is rotating outside of
both<00:01:30.869> arms<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.650> closer<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> audience

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
both arms that is closer to the audience

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
both arms that is closer to the audience
than<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:34.020> body<00:01:34.310> however<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
than it would be to my body however a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.190 
than it would be to my body however a
little<00:01:36.890> switch<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.340> puts<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
little switch up here puts it on the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
little switch up here puts it on the
inside<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.530> my<00:01:40.770> left<00:01:41.070> arm<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> see

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.179 
on the inside of the right hand as well
in<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.119> case<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> rotating<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> way

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
in which case it is rotating all the way

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.859 
in which case it is rotating all the way
through<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> bowl<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.750> things

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
through the bowl but just to make things

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
through the bowl but just to make things
even<00:01:58.079> more<00:01:58.200> confusing<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.579> set<00:01:59.939> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
even more confusing we can also set this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
even more confusing we can also set this
up<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> inside<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
up so that it's on the inside of the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
up so that it's on the inside of the
right<00:02:02.100> hands<00:02:02.340> bowl<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> outside<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
left hands bowl that's a lot to think

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
left hands bowl that's a lot to think
about<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> purposes<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.580> making<00:02:08.700> this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
about so for the purposes of making this

later lesson where we start talking

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.970 
later lesson where we start talking
about<00:02:25.410> inversions<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.490> right<00:02:26.700> so

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
about inversions and the like right so

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900 
about inversions and the like right so
the<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.130> we're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> start<00:02:29.670> drilling

the way we're going to start drilling
this<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:32.160> doing<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.460> in

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
this actually is I like doing this in

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
this actually is I like doing this in
split<00:02:32.880> time<00:02:33.060> same<00:02:33.360> direction<00:02:33.770> we're<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
split time same direction we're going to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.090 
split time same direction we're going to
place<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.300> two<00:02:36.480> poi<00:02:36.810> overlapping<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.800> such<00:02:38.070> a

way<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.910> would<00:02:39.210> hit<00:02:39.420> each<00:02:39.600> other<00:02:39.780> if

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
way that they would hit each other if

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.390 
way that they would hit each other if
they<00:02:40.140> were<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.440> same<00:02:40.770> side<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> bowl

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.230 
exercise by sticking my right arm
further<00:03:34.590> forward<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.580> my<00:03:35.730> right<00:03:35.760> hand

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
further forward so that my right hand

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.780 
further forward so that my right hand
poi<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:37.260> closer<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.160> audience<00:03:38.310> than

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
poi is now closer to the audience than

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.940 
poi is now closer to the audience than
it<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.180> me<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.600> my<00:03:40.050> left<00:03:40.290> hand<00:03:40.380> poi<00:03:40.740> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
it is to me and my left hand poi is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.570 
it is to me and my left hand poi is
rotating<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.840> hands<00:03:43.110> Bowl<00:03:43.410> yes<00:03:43.950> now

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
rotating in the right hands Bowl yes now

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.700 
rotating in the right hands Bowl yes now
this<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.270> not<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.900> dominant<00:03:46.050> way<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> do

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
this is not the dominant way that I do

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.220 
this is not the dominant way that I do
it<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.760> might<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.750> little<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.050> of

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
it so I might have a little bit of

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.080 
it so I might have a little bit of
issues<00:03:49.500> working<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:50.850> part<00:03:51.060> of

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
issues working on this but it's part of

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.570 
issues working on this but it's part of
the<00:03:51.150> learning<00:03:51.270> process<00:03:51.600> right<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.260> again<00:03:53.100> we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
the learning process right so again we

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.490 
the learning process right so again we
want<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.820> try<00:03:54.000> doing<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.960> with<00:03:55.020> our<00:03:55.260> arms

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
want to try doing this with our arms

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.890 
want to try doing this with our arms
crossed<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.160> again<00:03:56.640> I'm<00:03:56.850> keeping<00:03:57.570> my<00:03:57.690> left

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
crossed and again I'm keeping my left
