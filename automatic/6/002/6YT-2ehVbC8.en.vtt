customer who bought it liked it but

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
customer who bought it liked it but
found<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> inherent<00:00:30.269> flaws<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
found some of the inherent flaws in the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.770 
found some of the inherent flaws in the
original<00:00:31.140> construction<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:33.030> set<00:00:33.510> screw

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
original construction as the set screw

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.639 
original construction as the set screw
that<00:00:33.960> held<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> body<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:35.870> did<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.020> hold<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that held the body on did not hold up to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.610 
that held the body on did not hold up to
playing<00:00:38.399> around<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.350> actually

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
playing around with it so it actually

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
playing around with it so it actually
broke<00:00:40.980> through<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> threaded<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.950> he<00:00:43.950> sent<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
broke through the threaded so he sent it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.250 
broke through the threaded so he sent it
back<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> us<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> said<00:00:44.969> well<00:00:45.149> while<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
back to us and said well while we got it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.549 
back to us and said well while we got it
why<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.829> upgrade<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> soundboard<00:00:48.559> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
why not just upgrade the soundboard and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
why not just upgrade the soundboard and
you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> few<00:00:51.300> other

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you know see if we can do a few other

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.229 
you know see if we can do a few other
things<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.289> change<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> grips<00:00:52.980> out

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
things to it like change the grips out

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.060 
things to it like change the grips out
so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.930> did<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.649> upgraded<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so we did that we upgraded the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.619 
so we did that we upgraded the
soundboard<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> u.s.<00:00:57.180> 2.5<00:00:59.090> which<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.329> great

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
soundboard to a u.s. 2.5 which is great

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
soundboard to a u.s. 2.5 which is great
because<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.960> gets<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.620> fully<00:01:01.890> drive

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because it gets to actually fully drive

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.429 
because it gets to actually fully drive
the<00:01:02.399> red<00:01:02.609> LED<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:05.100> button<00:01:05.519> cap<00:01:05.760> screws

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
the red LED we put two button cap screws

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
the red LED we put two button cap screws
in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.740> lower<00:01:08.310> grip<00:01:08.610> section<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.360> give<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
in the lower grip section to give it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.890 
in the lower grip section to give it
more<00:01:09.750> rigidity<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> strength<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.570> change

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
more rigidity and strength and we change

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
more rigidity and strength and we change
the<00:01:13.260> plastic<00:01:13.920> t-track<00:01:14.549> grips<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.780> see

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the plastic t-track grips you can see

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.280 
the plastic t-track grips you can see
them<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> faux<00:01:17.130> control<00:01:17.640> box<00:01:18.290> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
them up here in the faux control box we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.550 
them up here in the faux control box we
change<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.400> powder<00:01:21.150> coated<00:01:21.630> square

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
change them out for powder coated square

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.550 
change them out for powder coated square
brass<00:01:22.979> stock<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.090> shaped<00:01:24.560> which

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
brass stock that we shaped which

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.080 
brass stock that we shaped which
actually<00:01:25.830> works<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.369> great<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually works out great because it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.340 
actually works out great because it's
the<00:01:27.240> exact<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.689> height<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:30.350> pommel

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the exact same height as the back pommel

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
the exact same height as the back pommel
ring<00:01:31.619> area<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> makes<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.479> more

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
ring area so it makes for a much more

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
ring area so it makes for a much more
comfortable<00:01:34.290> grip<00:01:34.560> very<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.759> much

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
comfortable grip very very very much

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859 
comfortable grip very very very much
lower<00:01:36.570> profile<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.460> added<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.880> replica

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
lower profile then we added some replica

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.100 
lower profile then we added some replica

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and much brighter we also had to redo

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.700 
and much brighter we also had to redo
the<00:02:35.260> switch<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.210> use<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.570> J<00:02:37.750> GaN<00:02:37.990> rebuild

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
the switch so we use the J GaN rebuild

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.800 
the switch so we use the J GaN rebuild
the<00:02:38.860> switch<00:02:39.100> method<00:02:39.550> which<00:02:40.210> we<00:02:40.360> took<00:02:40.510> apart

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the switch method which we took apart

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.760 
the switch method which we took apart
the<00:02:40.950> original<00:02:41.950> Judd<00:02:42.190> post<00:02:42.490> which<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.940> here<00:02:43.240> and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
the original Judd post which in here and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.610 
the original Judd post which in here and
implanted<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.830> tactile<00:02:45.310> switch<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:47.560> you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
implanted a tactile switch so now you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.130 
implanted a tactile switch so now you
just<00:02:47.740> tap<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.700> plunger<00:02:49.540> instead<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.960> having

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
just tap the plunger instead of having

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:59.199 
just tap the plunger instead of having
to<00:02:50.260> depress<00:02:50.680> it

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.080 

it<00:03:00.209> was<00:03:00.390> cool<00:03:00.599> before<00:03:01.340> now<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.580> much<00:03:02.819> cooler

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
