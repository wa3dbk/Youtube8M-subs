rather<00:00:19.920> than<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> old<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.029> dual<00:00:21.240> core<00:00:22.070> core<00:00:23.070> duo

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
rather than the old a dual core core duo

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.470 
rather than the old a dual core core duo
so<00:00:23.820> we'd<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.150> quick<00:00:24.420> unboxing<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:26.480> effect

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so we'd have a quick unboxing of effect

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.410 
so we'd have a quick unboxing of effect
mini<00:00:28.130> which<00:00:29.130> we've<00:00:29.849> managed<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.330> our

hands<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> inside<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:34.260> mini<00:00:34.440> itself

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
hands on so inside the mini itself

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.190 
hands on so inside the mini itself
immediately<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.579> top

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
immediately on top

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.360 
immediately on top
she'll<00:00:37.200> come<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.800> second<00:00:38.190> trial

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so this is your manual itself covers all

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.450 
so this is your manual itself covers all
the<00:00:48.420> setting<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.680> plugging<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.399> all

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the setting up and plugging in what all

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
the setting up and plugging in what all
the<00:00:50.520> connectors<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.590> bits

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the connectors do and all the other bits

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
the connectors do and all the other bits
and<00:00:52.920> pieces<00:00:53.120> basically<00:00:54.120> getting<00:00:54.480> started<00:00:55.110> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
obligatory two Apple stickers which is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.539 
obligatory two Apple stickers which is
cool<00:01:05.150> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> box<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.689> an<00:01:06.990> HDMI<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.590> DVI

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
cool in the box we have an HDMI to DVI

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149 
cool in the box we have an HDMI to DVI
connector<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.619> variety<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
connector so you can use a variety of
monitors<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> HDMI<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:12.960> also<00:01:13.170> DVI

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
monitors not just a HDMI I've also DVI

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
monitors not just a HDMI I've also DVI
style<00:01:14.010> monitors<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.909> Kay<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.240> included<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
style monitors that Kay was included and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.429 
style monitors that Kay was included and
then<00:01:16.619> last<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.119> standard<00:01:18.869> UK

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
then last of all we have a standard UK

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
then last of all we have a standard UK
through<00:01:19.710> pin<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.340> figure<00:01:20.790> eight<00:01:20.909> style

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
through pin to figure eight style

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170 
through pin to figure eight style
connector<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.070> plug<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
connector and so we can plug it in and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660 
connector and so we can plug it in and
power<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.159> moving<00:01:26.400> these<00:01:26.460> bits

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
power up so it's just moving these bits

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.789 
power up so it's just moving these bits
