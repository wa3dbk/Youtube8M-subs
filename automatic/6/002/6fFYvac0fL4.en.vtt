00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
noticed that her underground queue

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
noticed that her underground queue
ability<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.650> only<00:00:19.830> ability<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.640> she<00:00:20.789> has

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that has AP scaling but the AP scaling

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.359 
that has AP scaling but the AP scaling
is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> one-to-one<00:00:24.810> ratio<00:00:25.170> which<00:00:25.920> brings<00:00:26.160> up

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
is a one-to-one ratio which brings up

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.300 
is a one-to-one ratio which brings up
the<00:00:26.490> question<00:00:26.699> ap<00:00:27.599> rec<00:00:27.840> side<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.980> it

masteries all of that good stuff and by
the<00:00:51.930> end<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> video<00:00:52.440> hopefully<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the end of the video hopefully you have

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.220 
the end of the video hopefully you have
a<00:00:53.340> better<00:00:53.610> idea<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:54.300> whether<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> want

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
a better idea of whether or not you want

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
a better idea of whether or not you want
to<00:00:55.289> try<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.920> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.760> should

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to try this and if you do how you should

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
to try this and if you do how you should
go<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.050> first<00:00:58.320> let's<00:00:58.530> talk<00:00:58.739> about

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
go about it so first let's talk about

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.160 
go about it so first let's talk about
the<00:00:59.129> positives<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> find<00:01:00.270> an<00:01:00.420> AP<00:01:00.719> req<00:01:00.930> side

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the positives that I find an AP req side

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
the positives that I find an AP req side
the<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> fact<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.340> she

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the first one is the fact that she

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
the first one is the fact that she
surprisingly<00:01:03.239> has<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> naturally<00:01:04.409> tanky

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
surprisingly has a naturally tanky

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
surprisingly has a naturally tanky
laning<00:01:05.519> phase<00:01:05.760> which<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.450> good

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
laning phase which is really good

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
laning phase which is really good
because<00:01:07.080> playing<00:01:07.439> AP<00:01:07.830> reksai<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> terms<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
because playing AP reksai in terms of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
because playing AP reksai in terms of
her<00:01:09.030> rats<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> first<00:01:09.900> maybe<00:01:10.020> five<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
her rats for the first maybe five or so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.740 
her rats for the first maybe five or so
levels<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.090> best<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> laning

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
levels is not the best in the laning

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
levels is not the best in the laning
phase<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> forced<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> fight

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
phase so you are kind of forced to fight

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.830 
phase so you are kind of forced to fight
them<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.790> melee<00:01:15.090> range<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> laning<00:01:15.810> phase

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
them in melee range in the laning phase

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600 
them in melee range in the laning phase
for<00:01:16.200> example<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.799> under<00:01:16.979> them<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.400> e

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
for example going under them with your e

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
for example going under them with your e
popping<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.270> knocking<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:18.960> using<00:01:19.170> your

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
popping up knocking them up using your

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
popping up knocking them up using your
cute<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> uprooted<00:01:20.400> form<00:01:20.700> following<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.210> with

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
cute and uprooted form following up with

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
cute and uprooted form following up with
the<00:01:21.450> eat<00:01:21.659> etc<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.770> underground<00:01:23.280> queue

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the eat etc your underground queue

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920 
the eat etc your underground queue
doesn't<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.000> become<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> useful

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

plus<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.250> next<00:02:05.430> thing<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.790> course<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
plus the next thing is of course the

plus the next thing is of course the
fact<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.719> her<00:02:06.899> burrow<00:02:07.170> cute<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> a

one-to-one<00:02:08.340> ap<00:02:08.940> ratio<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
one-to-one ap ratio which really is the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.040 
one-to-one ap ratio which really is the
reason<00:02:10.500> behind

reason behind

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.260

why<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.200> bill<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.890> even<00:02:12.220> considered<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.970> cool

thing though also is the fact that she

thing though also is the fact that she
could<00:02:14.860> also<00:02:15.010> bring<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.490> some<00:02:15.520> much-needed<00:02:15.910> CC

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
could also bring in some much-needed CC

on<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.340> Magi<00:03:42.670> stacks<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> ensure<00:03:43.420> that<00:03:43.540> she

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
on the Magi stacks to ensure that she

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.540 
on the Magi stacks to ensure that she
can<00:03:43.810> keep<00:03:44.110> dishing<00:03:44.350> out<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.980> immense<00:03:45.280> damage

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.220 
can keep dishing out that immense damage
and<00:03:45.940> finally<00:03:46.330> she's<00:03:46.510> not<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.750> easiest<00:03:47.050> to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
and finally she's not the easiest to

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.750 
and finally she's not the easiest to
play<00:03:47.410> because<00:03:47.590> your<00:03:47.800> only<00:03:48.010> source<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.430> damage

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
play because your only source of damage

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.850 
play because your only source of damage
is<00:03:48.910> purely<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> skill<00:03:49.840> shot<00:03:50.020> so<00:03:50.440> now<00:03:50.560> let's<00:03:50.739> go

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
is purely a skill shot so now let's go

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.410 
is purely a skill shot so now let's go
into<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.220> item<00:03:51.550> builds<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.120> want<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.360> be

showing you guys two different build

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.560 
showing you guys two different build
paths<00:03:54.220> because<00:03:54.489> one<00:03:54.850> of<00:03:54.880> them<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.150> think<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.420> lot

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
paths because one of them I think a lot

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.600 
paths because one of them I think a lot
of<00:03:55.660> people<00:03:55.870> will<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.050> go<00:03:56.380> WTF<00:03:56.800> since<00:03:57.459> they're

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
of people will just go WTF since they're

that<00:03:59.320> there<00:03:59.620> are<00:03:59.650> two<00:03:59.800> build<00:04:00.280> paths<00:04:00.489> but<00:04:00.880> let's

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
that there are two build paths but let's

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.030 
that there are two build paths but let's
go<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.360> first<00:04:01.600> one<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:02.140> very<00:04:02.560> important

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.259 
thing to mention about the build that I
do<00:04:04.570> with<00:04:04.810> her<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.350> try<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.739> achieve<00:04:06.269> 40%

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
do with her is that I try to achieve 40%

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.210 
do with her is that I try to achieve 40%
cooldown<00:04:07.480> reduction<00:04:07.989> as<00:04:08.290> fast<00:04:08.560> as<00:04:08.709> possible

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
cooldown reduction as fast as possible

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.100 
cooldown reduction as fast as possible
because<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.180> important<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.930> want

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
because it is just so important you want

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.870 
because it is just so important you want
to<00:04:11.170> be<00:04:11.260> able<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.440> fire<00:04:11.739> off<00:04:12.010> those<00:04:12.220> skews<00:04:12.640> as

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
to be able to fire off those skews as

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.670 
to be able to fire off those skews as
often<00:04:13.300> as<00:04:13.420> possible<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.440> being<00:04:14.590> said

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
often as possible so that being said

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.070 
often as possible so that being said
with<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.100> build<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.610> try<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.880> get<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.150> 40%<00:04:16.510> CDR

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
with this build I try to get the 40% CDR

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.080 
with this build I try to get the 40% CDR
as<00:04:17.230> fast<00:04:17.620> as<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:17.859> possibly<00:04:17.890> can<00:04:18.549> by<00:04:18.760> getting

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
as fast as I possibly can by getting

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.370 
as fast as I possibly can by getting
doubled<00:04:19.510> morellonomicon

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
doubled morellonomicon

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.110 
doubled morellonomicon
a<00:04:20.590> lot<00:04:20.830> of<00:04:20.919> people<00:04:21.100> might<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.520> turned<00:04:21.760> off<00:04:21.940> by

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
a lot of people might be turned off by

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.620 
a lot of people might be turned off by
this<00:04:22.300> because

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
this because

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.570 
this because
just<00:04:22.900> simply<00:04:23.170> wasting<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> passive<00:04:24.130> stat<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
just simply wasting the passive stat and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.100 
just simply wasting the passive stat and
on<00:04:24.670> top<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.060> you're<00:04:25.240> getting<00:04:25.480> two<00:04:25.660> items

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
on top of that you're getting two items

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.990 
on top of that you're getting two items
that<00:04:26.200> offer<00:04:26.440> mana<00:04:26.770> regen<00:04:27.220> for<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.490> champion

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
that offer mana regen for a champion

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.430 
that offer mana regen for a champion
without<00:04:28.240> mana<00:04:28.480> but<00:04:28.900> look<00:04:29.020> at<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.200> bright<00:04:29.410> side

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
without mana but look at the bright side

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880 
without mana but look at the bright side
it<00:04:29.830> offers<00:04:30.130> 88p<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.150> offers<00:04:31.420> 20%<00:04:32.170> CDR<00:04:32.320> the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
it offers 88p it offers 20% CDR the

it offers 88p it offers 20% CDR the
passive<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.400> still<00:04:33.640> being<00:04:33.850> used<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.390> it's

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
passive is still being used and it's

only 2,100 gold it is a very

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.820 
only 2,100 gold it is a very
cost-efficient<00:04:37.480> item<00:04:37.750> then<00:04:38.140> I<00:04:38.260> always<00:04:38.590> follow

rabbit on sand I get a void stuff now
for<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.060> build<00:04:46.330> those<00:04:46.510> items<00:04:46.870> are<00:04:47.020> pretty

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
for this build those items are pretty

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.020 
for this build those items are pretty
much<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.680> only<00:04:47.890> ones<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.220> want<00:04:48.490> but<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:48.910> did

in case your MAGI stacks fall off and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.030 
in case your MAGI stacks fall off and
you'll<00:04:52.660> think<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.960> can<00:04:53.080> get<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.350> back<00:04:53.470> up<00:04:53.770> you

tried the Andris torment on this
champion<00:05:00.010> yet<00:05:00.190> but<00:05:00.370> I've<00:05:00.460> heard<00:05:00.670> good<00:05:00.850> things

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
champion yet but I've heard good things

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.970 
champion yet but I've heard good things
so<00:05:01.480> use<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.690> on<00:05:01.900> your<00:05:02.050> own<00:05:02.170> caution<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.800> the

final thing I want to mention is that

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.180 
final thing I want to mention is that
getting<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.660> scrying<00:05:05.110> orb<00:05:05.380> could<00:05:05.710> be<00:05:05.770> extremely

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
getting a scrying orb could be extremely

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.770 
getting a scrying orb could be extremely
beneficial<00:05:06.430> because<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.330> want<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.600> be<00:05:07.720> able

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
beneficial because you want to be able

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.970 
beneficial because you want to be able
to<00:05:07.900> see<00:05:08.140> your<00:05:08.290> opponent's<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.890> you're

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
to see your opponent's that you're

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.800 
to see your opponent's that you're
sniping<00:05:09.160> down<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.060> there<00:05:10.270> was<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.570> first

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
sniping down so that there was the first

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.240 
sniping down so that there was the first
build<00:05:11.140> but<00:05:11.320> let's<00:05:11.440> go<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.800> second<00:05:12.220> one

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
build but let's go to the second one

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.580 
build but let's go to the second one
which<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.550> just<00:05:12.670> a<00:05:13.030> small<00:05:13.180> variation<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:14.200> still

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
which is just a small variation I still

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.260 
which is just a small variation I still
get<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.740> morellonomicon<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.700> I<00:05:15.730> only<00:05:15.970> get

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
get the morellonomicon but I only get

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.180 
get the morellonomicon but I only get
one<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.810> pretty<00:05:17.110> much<00:05:17.230> all<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.590> other<00:05:17.620> items

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
one and pretty much all the other items

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.920 
one and pretty much all the other items
are<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.490> same<00:05:18.790> but<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.270> difference<00:05:19.390> now<00:05:19.750> is

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
are the same but the difference now is

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.750 
are the same but the difference now is
that<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.140> get<00:05:20.290> boots<00:05:20.530> of<00:05:20.680> lucidity<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.610> with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
that you get boots of lucidity so with

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.600 
that you get boots of lucidity so with
boots<00:05:22.030> Morel<00:05:22.480> nomicon<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.230> 5%<00:05:23.680> CDR<00:05:24.310> from<00:05:24.490> your

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
