breathing the air touching sand when

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.350 
breathing the air touching sand when
they<00:02:57.660> come<00:02:57.870> back<00:02:57.950> they're<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.760> different

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
they come back they're like a different

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.230 
they come back they're like a different
person<00:03:00.480> they're<00:03:01.440> much<00:03:01.590> more<00:03:01.800> mature<00:03:02.240> they're

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
person they're much more mature they're

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.130 
person they're much more mature they're
much<00:03:03.450> more<00:03:03.690> aware<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.310> what<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.790> be

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
much more aware of what it's like to be

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.630 
much more aware of what it's like to be
from<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> United<00:03:07.560> States<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.610> our

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
from the United States and what our

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.540 
from the United States and what our
culture<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.620> compared<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.770> what<00:03:11.040> culture

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
culture is like compared to what culture

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.150 
culture is like compared to what culture
and<00:03:11.880> what<00:03:12.750> different<00:03:13.440> countries<00:03:13.800> are<00:03:13.980> like

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
and what different countries are like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400 
and what different countries are like
and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.300> think<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.780> makes<00:03:16.050> them<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> better

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and I think it just makes them a better

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.979 
and I think it just makes them a better
person<00:03:16.860> for<00:03:16.890> doing<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.630> duty<00:03:18.750> at

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
person for doing that it's our duty at

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
person for doing that it's our duty at
the<00:03:19.170> university<00:03:19.980> level<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.610> help<00:03:20.910> students

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the university level to help students

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.690 
the university level to help students
develop<00:03:21.560> more<00:03:22.560> sophisticated<00:03:22.739> understanding

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
develop more sophisticated understanding

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.310 
develop more sophisticated understanding
of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.060> world<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.480> includes<00:03:25.020> these

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
of the world that includes these

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.530 
of the world that includes these
international<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.489> local<00:03:26.550> dimensions<00:03:27.330> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
international and local dimensions and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.850 
international and local dimensions and
their<00:03:27.690> internet

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
their internet

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.100 
their internet
I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.220> awareness<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.970> key<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.210> think<00:03:30.420> knowing

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
I think awareness is key I think knowing

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.500 
I think awareness is key I think knowing
that<00:03:31.500> there's<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.160> study<00:03:32.400> abroad<00:03:32.700> office<00:03:32.820> on

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that there's a study abroad office on

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.200 
that there's a study abroad office on
campus<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.860> their<00:03:35.100> resources<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:36.150> are

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
campus that their resources that are

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.240 
campus that their resources that are
available<00:03:37.010> internationalization<00:03:38.010> is

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
available internationalization is

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.980 
available internationalization is
something<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:39.000> moving<00:03:39.480> more<00:03:39.660> and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
something that we're moving more and

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.770 
something that we're moving more and
more<00:03:40.560> toward<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.130> if<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.970> don't<00:03:42.210> do

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
more toward and if we don't do

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.600 
more toward and if we don't do
everything<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.740> we<00:03:43.800> can<00:03:43.860> possibly<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
everything that we can possibly do to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.260 
everything that we can possibly do to
get<00:03:44.970> our<00:03:45.090> students<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:46.190> grow<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> area<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
get our students to grow in this area to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.150 
get our students to grow in this area to
appreciate<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.170> think<00:03:49.470> that's<00:03:49.710> just<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.980> real

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
appreciate it I think that's just a real

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.200 
appreciate it I think that's just a real
loss<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.760> us<00:03:50.790> i<00:03:52.280> feel<00:03:53.280> myself<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:54.090> i've

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
started to accept few things initially

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.980 
started to accept few things initially
which<00:03:59.160> were<00:03:59.370> unacceptable<00:04:00.150> for<00:04:00.330> me<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.570> now

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
which were unacceptable for me and now
