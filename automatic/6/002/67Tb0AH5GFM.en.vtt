00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 never in my life had I been so 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.879
 disappointed since I saw the movie 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.919
 'the untouchables' and since my father 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.610

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.610
 Never came back 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.770

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.460
 the worst games of all time 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.400

 make a fucking list of top 10 worst 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.050
 things of all times because those 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.360
 disappointing moments do not compare 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.580
 with the disappointment that one feels 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.690
