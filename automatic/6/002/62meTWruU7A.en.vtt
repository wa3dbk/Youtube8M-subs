00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
guys an in-depth tutorial on how to get

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.990 
guys an in-depth tutorial on how to get
the<00:00:07.529> fire<00:00:07.710> staff<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.250> your<00:00:08.370> first<00:00:08.519> step<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.940> you

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
the fire staff so your first step is you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.520 
the fire staff so your first step is you
have<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.300> locate<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.809> red<00:00:09.960> disk<00:00:10.290> that's

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
have to locate the red disk that's

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.810 
have to locate the red disk that's
usually<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.099> located<00:00:11.400> at<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
usually going to be located at the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.669 
usually going to be located at the
church<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> second<00:00:12.809> floor<00:00:12.960> by<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.259> chairs

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
church on the second floor by the chairs

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.860 
church on the second floor by the chairs
so<00:00:14.610> that's<00:00:14.790> step<00:00:14.969> number<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.299> once<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.719> do

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
so that's step number one once you do

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.779 
so that's step number one once you do
that<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> next<00:00:17.279> step<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.580> you're<00:00:17.670> gonna

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that then the next step is you're gonna

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.490 
that then the next step is you're gonna
have<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.150> three<00:00:18.359> parts<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:18.900> there's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
have to get three parts now there's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.050 
have to get three parts now there's
three<00:00:19.920> different<00:00:20.039> ways<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.670> two<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
three different ways to get two of the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.519 
three different ways to get two of the
parts<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.630> either<00:00:21.779> get<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> from<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> box

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
parts you can either get it from the box

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.750 
parts you can either get it from the box
like<00:00:22.800> you're<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.279> he<00:00:23.430> does<00:00:23.580> right

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
from the ground usually in parts that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
from the ground usually in parts that
aren't<00:00:29.880> covered<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.300> though<00:00:30.570> there's<00:00:31.289> three

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
aren't covered it's though there's three

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
this stand and what it's going to do is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
this stand and what it's going to do is
it's<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> open<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.189> secret<00:01:38.549> room

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it's going to open up a secret room

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.190 
it's going to open up a secret room
right<00:01:39.000> below<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.600> blue<00:01:39.810> area<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
right below where that blue area is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.420 
right below where that blue area is
right<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.770> he's<00:01:40.920> putting<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> down

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
right there so he's putting it down

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
right there so he's putting it down
right<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.320> believe<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> play

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
right now I believe it's going to play

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
right now I believe it's going to play
like<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:43.950> type<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> music<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:44.970> something

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
like some type of music or something

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
like some type of music or something
like<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.810> opens<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:46.530> towards

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
like that and it opens up a way towards

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.359 
like that and it opens up a way towards
the<00:01:47.009> bottom<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:48.740> guess<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> place

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the bottom I guess this is the place

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
the bottom I guess this is the place
that<00:01:50.549> people<00:01:50.610> call<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> secret<00:01:51.509> room<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.930> he's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that people call the secret room so he's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.450 
that people call the secret room so he's
going<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.500> towards<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.829> secret<00:01:53.130> room<00:01:53.250> right

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
going down towards the secret room right

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.149 
going down towards the secret room right
now<00:01:53.610> fellas<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.899> he's<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.040> down

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you're going to be building another

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.650 
you're going to be building another
teleporter<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> jump<00:02:46.770> back<00:02:46.950> into<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
teleporter for you to jump back into and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.820 
teleporter for you to jump back into and
the<00:02:48.660> rocks<00:02:48.870> will<00:02:49.050> start<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> shift

the rocks will start to shift

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.830 
the rocks will start to shift
I<00:02:49.890> guess<00:02:50.430> zombies<00:02:50.880> could<00:02:51.030> come<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.330> well<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
I guess zombies could come as well the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.250 
I guess zombies could come as well the
Templars<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.360> he's<00:02:54.360> building<00:02:54.930> himself
