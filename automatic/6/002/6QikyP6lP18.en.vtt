Tyranitar<00:00:08.519> or<00:00:08.730> Blastoise<00:00:09.719> but<00:00:10.530> since<00:00:11.070> you

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
Tyranitar or Blastoise but since you

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.520 
Tyranitar or Blastoise but since you
know<00:00:11.460> he<00:00:11.700> has<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> Blastoise<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:13.110> gonna<00:00:13.320> think

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
know he has a Blastoise I'm gonna think

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.650 
know he has a Blastoise I'm gonna think
it<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.610> blasters<00:00:15.059> just<00:00:15.330> because

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
it is going to be blasters just because

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.490 
it is going to be blasters just because
I<00:00:16.020> mean

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I mean

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
I mean
Blastoise<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.340> useful<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Blastoise is useful because it is a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.080 
Blastoise is useful because it is a
spinner<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.779> course<00:00:19.170> um<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:20.310> usually<00:00:20.910> you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
spinner of course um but usually you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.250 
spinner of course um but usually you
don't<00:00:21.270> see

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
don't see

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.740 
don't see
Blastoise<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> much<00:00:23.580> still<00:00:23.820> know<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.510> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
Blastoise that much still know you so I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
Blastoise that much still know you so I
don't<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.260> that's<00:00:25.410> why<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.650> gonna<00:00:25.920> expect

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
don't know that's why I'm gonna expect

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
don't know that's why I'm gonna expect
it<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.849> he<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:27.840> ends<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.109> going

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

this ridiculous die

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.840 
this ridiculous die
I<00:00:48.440> mean<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.770> doesn't<00:00:50.190> matter<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I mean it really doesn't matter at all I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.389 
I mean it really doesn't matter at all I
mean<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.180> need<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.690> thing<00:00:52.020> too<00:00:52.980> much

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
mean I don't need this thing too much

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.920 
mean I don't need this thing too much
because<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.300> gets<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.570> wall<00:00:54.780> down

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
because it kind of just gets a wall down

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.260 
because it kind of just gets a wall down
by<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.800> Blastoise<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> tyrant<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.120> stuff

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
by like Blastoise of tyrant or and stuff

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.400 
by like Blastoise of tyrant or and stuff
like<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> had<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> go<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> my

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
like that so I just had to go to my

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
like that so I just had to go to my
Gengar<00:00:58.800> game<00:00:59.730> guard<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.270> pretty<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:00.510> just

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Gengar game guard can pretty much just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
Gengar game guard can pretty much just
go<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.680> shadow<00:01:02.399> ball<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.090> Focus<00:01:03.570> Blast

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
go for a shadow ball or Focus Blast

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
go for a shadow ball or Focus Blast
really<00:01:04.080> whatever<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.500> wants<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
really whatever it wants to go for and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
really whatever it wants to go for and
just<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> damage<00:01:06.270> he<00:01:06.930> ends<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
just do a lot of damage he ends up

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
just do a lot of damage he ends up
bringing<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.010> his<00:01:08.310> egg<00:01:08.549> slash<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> might

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
bringing in his egg slash and I might

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
bringing in his egg slash and I might
the<00:01:09.869> nice<00:01:10.020> prediction<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.799> my<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the nice prediction on my going for the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 
the nice prediction on my going for the
Shadow<00:01:11.939> Ball<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.450> being<00:01:12.960> able<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> almost

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Shadow Ball and being able to almost

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.270 
Shadow Ball and being able to almost
kill<00:01:14.909> his<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> slash<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.080> guess<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> reason<00:01:17.100> as

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
kill his a slash I guess the reason as

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.060 
kill his a slash I guess the reason as
to<00:01:17.340> why<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.580> may<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.060> predicted<00:01:18.720> me<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.650> for

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to why he may be predicted me to go for

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
to why he may be predicted me to go for
that<00:01:20.340> um<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:21.659> uh<00:01:21.689> Shadow<00:01:22.200> Ball<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> instead

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that um that uh Shadow Ball and instead

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
that um that uh Shadow Ball and instead
of<00:01:23.340> focus<00:01:23.610> bus<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.750> had<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> game

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
of focus bus was because we had a game

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429 
of focus bus was because we had a game
before<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.570> wasn't<00:01:28.350> very

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
before and it actually just wasn't very

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
before and it actually just wasn't very
good<00:01:28.680> he<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.130> distracted<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.820> he<00:01:30.060> wanted<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
good he got distracted and he wanted a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.710 
good he got distracted and he wanted a
rematch<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:32.130> doing<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.180> had<00:01:33.299> actually

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
rematch so with doing so I had actually

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
rematch so with doing so I had actually
gone<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> Focus<00:01:34.619> Blast<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.130> knock<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.520> his

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
before and like the same exact situation
so<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.130> he<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.310> doing<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.549> maybe

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
so there I think he was doing that maybe
I<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.119> same<00:01:42.299> thing<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I do the same thing but actually I just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
I do the same thing but actually I just
went<00:01:43.290> straight<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.649> Shadow<00:01:43.890> Ball<00:01:44.070> able<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.670> do

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
went straight and Shadow Ball able to do

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
went straight and Shadow Ball able to do
damage<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.780> eggy<00:01:45.930> slash<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.009> thing

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

torching out now what he's gonna do is
he<00:03:07.690> actually<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:08.230> goes<00:03:08.500> into<00:03:09.209> Tyranitar<00:03:10.209> and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
he actually just goes into Tyranitar and

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.940 
he actually just goes into Tyranitar and
like<00:03:11.400> why<00:03:13.350> why<00:03:14.350> makes<00:03:15.340> no<00:03:15.670> sense<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.270> all<00:03:16.950> even

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
like why why makes no sense at all even

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.520 
like why why makes no sense at all even
if<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.490> didn't<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.360> go<00:03:19.570> for<00:03:19.810> play<00:03:20.050> raw<00:03:20.260> for

superpower all are super effective

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.530 
superpower all are super effective
against<00:03:26.260> direct<00:03:26.970> Tyranitar<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.270> didn't

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
against direct Tyranitar so I didn't

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
against direct Tyranitar so I didn't
really<00:03:28.690> understand<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.140> move<00:03:29.350> right<00:03:29.500> there

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560

able to easily knock out the Blastoise

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.070 
able to easily knock out the Blastoise
which<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.390> gonna<00:04:01.540> be<00:04:01.660> fun

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
which it's gonna be fun

have to worry about him anymore what's
gonna<00:04:07.120> happen<00:04:07.450> now<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:07.900> he's<00:04:08.320> actually

going to end up bringing

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.500 
going to end up bringing
is<00:04:11.240> Kivar<00:04:12.240> Oh<00:04:12.270> which<00:04:12.630> would<00:04:12.870> be<00:04:13.080> his<00:04:13.440> over<00:04:13.890> so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
is Kivar Oh which would be his over so

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.150 
is Kivar Oh which would be his over so
didn't<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:15.930> what<00:04:16.110> no<00:04:16.800> I<00:04:16.830> permit

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
didn't really know what no I permit

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.190 
didn't really know what no I permit
would<00:04:17.370> end<00:04:17.610> up<00:04:17.760> doing<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.330> me<00:04:18.480> I<00:04:18.660> kind<00:04:19.050> of<00:04:19.140> just

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
would end up doing to me I kind of just

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.500 
would end up doing to me I kind of just
felt<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:20.400> would<00:04:20.520> just<00:04:20.580> go<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.120> Draco

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
felt like it would just go for a Draco

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.600 
felt like it would just go for a Draco
meteor<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:21.959> something<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.980> she<00:04:23.070> ends<00:04:23.250> up<00:04:23.310> over

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
meteor or something it she ends up over

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.990 
meteor or something it she ends up over
hurricane<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.390> it's<00:04:24.780> going<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.110> do<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:26.000> decent

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
hurricane and it's going to do a decent

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.940 
hurricane and it's going to do a decent
amount<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.450> damage<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.410> know<00:04:28.500> plucky

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
amount of damage and you know plucky

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.590 
amount of damage and you know plucky
isn't<00:04:29.250> especially<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.730> fits<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:30.030> law<00:04:30.240> but<00:04:30.480> it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
isn't especially in fits of law but it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.270 
isn't especially in fits of law but it
still<00:04:30.870> resists<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.710> obviously<00:04:31.920> this

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
still resists it but obviously this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.130 
still resists it but obviously this
thing<00:04:32.370> aspects<00:04:32.850> he's<00:04:33.360> now<00:04:33.540> just<00:04:33.570> able<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.050> go

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
thing aspects he's now just able to go

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.990 
thing aspects he's now just able to go
for<00:04:34.290> another<00:04:34.380> hurricane<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.160> kind<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.760> I

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
for another hurricane I kind of just I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.090 
for another hurricane I kind of just I
don't<00:04:36.600> know<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:37.050> should<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.410> gone<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.740> T<00:04:37.860> wave

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
don't know I should have gone for T wave

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.490 
don't know I should have gone for T wave
but<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:39.090> kind<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.540> thought<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.870> if<00:04:40.080> maybe<00:04:40.290> he

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
but I kind of thought that if maybe he

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.930 
but I kind of thought that if maybe he
would<00:04:40.650> switch<00:04:40.890> out<00:04:41.130> or<00:04:41.280> something<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.790> don't

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
would switch out or something I don't

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.310 
would switch out or something I don't
know<00:04:42.030> what<00:04:42.210> he<00:04:42.360> would<00:04:42.480> switch<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.870> up<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.290> I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
know what he would switch it up to I

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.390 
know what he would switch it up to I
guess<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:45.530> probably<00:04:46.530> should<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.890> got<00:04:46.980> 40<00:04:47.250> way

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
guess I probably should you got 40 way

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.710 
guess I probably should you got 40 way
there<00:04:47.640> but<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.910> doesn't<00:04:48.090> really<00:04:48.270> matter<00:04:48.510> I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
there but it doesn't really matter I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.090 
there but it doesn't really matter I

really not much you can do to me
and<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.580> just<00:04:56.730> kind<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.030> decide<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.570> go<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
and I just kind of decide to go for the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.990 
and I just kind of decide to go for the
sacred<00:04:58.350> sword<00:04:58.590> now<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:58.920> was<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.160> weird<00:04:59.460> play<00:04:59.760> I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
sacred sword now this was a weird play I

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.390 
sacred sword now this was a weird play I
would<00:05:00.420> for<00:05:00.570> sacred<00:05:00.990> sword<00:05:01.400> especially

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
would for sacred sword especially

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.470 
would for sacred sword especially
thinking<00:05:02.640> he<00:05:02.730> would<00:05:02.820> go<00:05:02.910> with<00:05:03.030> an<00:05:03.090> extra<00:05:03.360> girl

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
thinking he would go with an extra girl

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.900 
thinking he would go with an extra girl
right<00:05:03.660> here<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.980> didn't<00:05:05.430> happen<00:05:05.520> at<00:05:05.820> all

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
right here and that didn't happen at all

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.690 
right here and that didn't happen at all
so<00:05:06.300> kind<00:05:06.600> of<00:05:06.630> what<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.810> have<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.110> do<00:05:07.350> now<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.950> I

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
so kind of what I have to do now is I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.090 
so kind of what I have to do now is I
got<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:08.940> play<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.210> safe<00:05:09.470> either<00:05:10.470> I<00:05:10.590> can<00:05:10.770> go<00:05:10.920> for

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
got to play it safe either I can go for

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.350 
got to play it safe either I can go for
sword<00:05:11.370> stance<00:05:11.640> more<00:05:11.880> than<00:05:11.970> go<00:05:12.060> for<00:05:12.240> another

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
sword stance more than go for another

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.480 
sword stance more than go for another
shadow<00:05:12.720> seek<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.830> he<00:05:13.890> actually<00:05:13.980> in<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.280> ends

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
shadow seek but he actually in the ends

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.160 
shadow seek but he actually in the ends
of<00:05:14.550> going<00:05:14.790> from<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.030> Gengar<00:05:15.480> because<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.810> guess

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
of going from the Gengar because I guess

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.660 
of going from the Gengar because I guess
he<00:05:16.200> wants<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.620> keep<00:05:16.800> his<00:05:16.950> boyfriend<00:05:17.400> off<00:05:17.460> for

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
he wants to keep his boyfriend off for

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.360 
he wants to keep his boyfriend off for
later<00:05:17.790> just<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:19.050> way<00:05:19.200> he<00:05:19.500> can<00:05:19.650> actually<00:05:20.250> do

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
later just that way he can actually do

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.600 
later just that way he can actually do
damage<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.820> me<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.450> don't<00:05:22.410> know<00:05:22.590> X<00:05:23.070> could<00:05:23.370> rely

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
damage to me I don't know X could rely

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.100 
damage to me I don't know X could rely
thought<00:05:23.850> would<00:05:24.060> be<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.210> better<00:05:24.420> switching<00:05:24.930> but

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
thought would be a better switching but

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.420 
thought would be a better switching but
maybe<00:05:25.320> he<00:05:25.530> thought<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:25.890> would<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.280> for

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
maybe he thought that I would go for

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.070 
maybe he thought that I would go for
another<00:05:26.610> sacred<00:05:27.030> sword<00:05:27.270> or<00:05:27.720> something<00:05:27.900> like

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
another sacred sword or something like

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.720 
another sacred sword or something like
that<00:05:28.260> maybe<00:05:28.530> that's<00:05:28.740> all<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.070> had<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.310> attack

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
that maybe that's all I had to attack

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.060 
that maybe that's all I had to attack
him<00:05:29.910> with<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.210> don't<00:05:30.270> know<00:05:30.420> but<00:05:31.080> that's<00:05:31.830> fine

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
him with I don't know but that's fine

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.860

basically<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:47.070> game<00:05:47.550> guard<00:05:47.790> is<00:05:47.850> dead<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.240> he

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
basically the game guard is dead and he

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.170 
basically the game guard is dead and he
has<00:05:48.390> extra<00:05:49.050> which<00:05:49.410> is<00:05:49.800> at<00:05:50.220> like<00:05:50.370> forth<00:05:50.730> itself

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
has extra which is at like forth itself

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.279 
has extra which is at like forth itself
and<00:05:51.480> he<00:05:51.660> has

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
and he has

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.260 
and he has
a<00:05:52.379> Norvin<00:05:53.159> which<00:05:53.309> is<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.610> even<00:05:53.879> less<00:05:54.029> help

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
a Norvin which is that even less help

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.089 
a Norvin which is that even less help
than<00:05:54.330> that<00:05:54.449> so<00:05:54.899> he<00:05:55.379> ends<00:05:55.529> up<00:05:55.559> going<00:05:55.710> for<00:05:55.919> shadow

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
than that so he ends up going for shadow

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.679 
than that so he ends up going for shadow
sneak<00:05:56.249> all<00:05:56.699> right<00:05:56.879> and<00:05:57.149> a<00:05:57.210> girl<00:05:57.389> for<00:05:57.539> sure<00:05:57.569> to
