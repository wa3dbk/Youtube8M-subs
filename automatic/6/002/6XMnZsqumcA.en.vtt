pushing<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.220> set<00:02:16.370> button<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:17.180> allow<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
pushing the set button I can allow the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.750 
pushing the set button I can allow the
delay<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.740> other<00:02:18.890> words<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> first<00:02:19.370> exposure

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
delay in other words the first exposure

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.500 
delay in other words the first exposure
has<00:02:19.940> only<00:02:20.060> taken<00:02:20.240> after<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.130> case<00:02:22.510> 99

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
has only taken after in this case 99

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.300 
has only taken after in this case 99
hours<00:02:23.870> time<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.770> can<00:02:24.890> control<00:02:25.280> exactly

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
hours time so you can control exactly

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.860 
hours time so you can control exactly
when<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.910> want<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.180> first<00:02:26.390> exposure<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
when you want the first exposure to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.870 
when you want the first exposure to
start<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.950> want<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.130> wait<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.250> long<00:02:28.460> so

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
start I don't want to wait that long so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.740 
start I don't want to wait that long so
we're<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.210> go<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.630> zero<00:02:31.750> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
we're going to go back to zero and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.910 
we're going to go back to zero and
that's<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.080> course<00:02:33.230> four<00:02:33.440> minutes<00:02:33.710> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that's of course four minutes and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.080 
that's of course four minutes and
seconds<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:36.560> go<00:02:36.710> over<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.950> long<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:38.060> is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
seconds we then go over to long this is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.730 
seconds we then go over to long this is
controlling<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.750> length<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.290> exposure

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
controlling the length of your exposure

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.100 
controlling the length of your exposure
time<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.670> if<00:02:40.760> each<00:02:40.970> exposure<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.959> want

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
time so if each exposure that you want

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.720 
time so if each exposure that you want
to<00:02:42.170> photograph<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.800> going<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.280> be<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.580> minute

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.510 
to photograph is going to be one minute
you<00:02:44.390> would<00:02:44.570> click<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.410> set<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> your

you would click on set go to your
minutes<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.970> go<00:02:47.600> up<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.320> each<00:02:48.680> exposure<00:02:49.160> time

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610
