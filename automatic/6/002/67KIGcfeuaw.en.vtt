might<00:00:30.750> depend<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:31.679> coach

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
might depend a little bit on my coach

might depend a little bit on my coach
and<00:00:32.399> my<00:00:32.489> team<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.870> neutral<00:00:34.350> situation

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I think that there's a couple of things

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
I think that there's a couple of things
that<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.710> stand<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.820> me<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.180> give

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that really stand out to me that give

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
that really stand out to me that give
him<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.110> very<00:00:43.379> slight<00:00:43.770> edge<00:00:44.040> over

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
him the the very slight edge over

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.229 
him the the very slight edge over
Russell<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.570> physicality<00:00:46.350> he<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.550> elite

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
Russell one is physicality he has elite

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.779 
Russell one is physicality he has elite
size<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.170> strength<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> player<00:00:50.520> his

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
size and strength for a player his

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459 
size and strength for a player his
position<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.230> gonna<00:00:52.379> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
position and I think that's gonna be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.819 
position and I think that's gonna be
very<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:53.160> helpful<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.699> him<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.050> NBA<00:00:55.379> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
struck me about mudiay when I had the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
struck me about mudiay when I had the
chance<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.659> watch<00:01:15.869> him<00:01:16.080> work<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.380> and

chance to go watch him work out and
interview<00:01:16.890> him<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.689> mentality

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
interview him was was just his mentality

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
interview him was was just his mentality
about<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.799> league<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.369> hanging<00:01:21.270> around

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
about the league I think hanging around

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
about the league I think hanging around
those<00:01:21.900> NBA<00:01:22.350> vets<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> had<00:01:23.130> washed<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.729> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
those NBA vets that had washed out of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
those NBA vets that had washed out of
the<00:01:23.939> league<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> figuring<00:01:25.259> out<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.470> hard<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the league and figuring out how hard it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
the league and figuring out how hard it
is<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> NBA<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.380> he

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is to make the NBA I think he

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
is to make the NBA I think he
understands<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> work<00:01:29.549> ethic<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.150> gonna

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
understands the work ethic that's gonna

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
understands the work ethic that's gonna
take<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.930> him<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.320> great<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.220> think

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
take for him to be great and I think

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
take for him to be great and I think
he's<00:01:32.549> willing<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> put<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> work<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
he's willing to put in that work and and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
he's willing to put in that work and and
that<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:35.820> anything

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that thing I think more than anything

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
that thing I think more than anything
else<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.659> him<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.799> me<00:01:37.890> over

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
they are work ethic I saw that over and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.300 
they are work ethic I saw that over and
over<00:03:21.810> again<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.410> these<00:03:22.500> players<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.010> look<00:03:23.160> I

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
over again and these players and look I

love<00:03:23.670> Russell<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.209> agree<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
love Russell I agree with you that I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.500 
love Russell I agree with you that I
think<00:03:25.049> he's<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.470> most<00:03:25.620> skilled<00:03:26.090> guard<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
think he's the most skilled guard in the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.140 
think he's the most skilled guard in the
draft<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.049> year<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.320> think<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.400> comparisons

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
draft this year I think the comparisons

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.300 
draft this year I think the comparisons
if<00:03:30.630> you're<00:03:30.810> looking<00:03:31.110> at<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> upper<00:03:31.680> end<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
if you're looking at the upper end to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.420 
if you're looking at the upper end to
whether<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.000> James<00:03:33.959> Harden<00:03:34.470> or<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.920> stuff

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
whether it's a James Harden or a stuff

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.949 
whether it's a James Harden or a stuff
Curry's<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:36.000> type<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.329> player<00:03:36.660> I'm<00:03:36.810> not

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
Curry's that type of player I'm not

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.600 
Curry's that type of player I'm not
saying<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.350> he's<00:03:37.530> gonna<00:03:37.650> be<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> MVP<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
saying that he's gonna be the MVP of the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.949 
saying that he's gonna be the MVP of the
league<00:03:38.640> someday<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.269> mean<00:03:39.570> that's<00:03:39.720> that's

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
league someday I mean that's that's

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.470 
league someday I mean that's that's
lofty<00:03:40.590> expectations<00:03:40.970> but<00:03:41.970> he's<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> type<00:03:42.450> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
lofty expectations but he's that type of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000 
lofty expectations but he's that type of
player<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.989> there's<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.170> trend<00:03:43.500> towards<00:03:43.829> these

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
player and there's a trend towards these

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.880 
player and there's a trend towards these
playmaking<00:03:44.609> sweet<00:03:45.480> shooting<00:03:45.930> guards<00:03:46.650> right

playmaking sweet shooting guards right

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.160 
playmaking sweet shooting guards right
now<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.640> understand<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.840> excitement

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
now and I understand the excitement

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.900 
now and I understand the excitement
about<00:03:49.530> Russell<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.130> I'd<00:03:50.220> also<00:03:50.370> say<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
about Russell but I'd also say that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.910 
about Russell but I'd also say that
there's<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.239> lot<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.420> successful<00:03:52.019> guards<00:03:52.829> in

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
there's a lot of successful guards in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.319 
there's a lot of successful guards in
the<00:03:53.010> league<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:53.820> big<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.239> athletic

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
the league that are big and athletic

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.300 
the league that are big and athletic
whether<00:03:54.959> that's<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.410> Derrick<00:03:55.680> Rose<00:03:55.950> or<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
whether that's a Derrick Rose or a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.699 
whether that's a Derrick Rose or a
Russell<00:03:56.609> Westbrook<00:03:57.239> or<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> John<00:03:58.079> Wall<00:03:58.380> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
Russell Westbrook or a John Wall and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.699 
Russell Westbrook or a John Wall and
Emmanuel<00:03:59.489> mudiay<00:03:59.700> fits<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.510> those<00:04:01.049> mold<00:04:01.350> and

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
Emmanuel mudiay fits in those mold and

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.680 
Emmanuel mudiay fits in those mold and
there's<00:04:01.829> one<00:04:02.070> thing<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.640> think<00:04:03.510> more<00:04:03.660> than

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
there's one thing I think more than

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.240 
there's one thing I think more than
anything<00:04:04.049> else<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.680> stands<00:04:04.920> out<00:04:05.070> for

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
anything else that really stands out for

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.190 
anything else that really stands out for
me<00:04:05.370> if<00:04:05.579> we<00:04:05.790> went<00:04:06.060> back<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.299> asked<00:04:06.750> any<00:04:06.959> NBA

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
me if we went back and asked any NBA

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.729 
me if we went back and asked any NBA
Scout<00:04:07.799> last<00:04:08.160> year<00:04:08.430> one<00:04:09.180> year<00:04:09.420> ago<00:04:09.540> who<00:04:10.320> was<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
Scout last year one year ago who was the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.650 
Scout last year one year ago who was the
the<00:04:11.040> best<00:04:11.250> guard<00:04:11.519> in<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.850> draft<00:04:12.180> they<00:04:12.420> would

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
the best guard in this draft they would

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.380 
the best guard in this draft they would
say<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.380> hundred<00:04:14.190> percent<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.730> them<00:04:14.880> hands<00:04:15.180> down

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
say a hundred percent of them hands down

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.360 
say a hundred percent of them hands down
it<00:04:15.570> was<00:04:15.660> Emmanuel<00:04:16.049> mudiay<00:04:16.200> he<00:04:16.919> didn't<00:04:17.160> play<00:04:17.280> at

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
it was Emmanuel mudiay he didn't play at

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.990 
it was Emmanuel mudiay he didn't play at
SMU<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.539> they<00:04:18.630> didn't<00:04:18.840> get<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.959> scene<00:04:19.200> play<00:04:19.470> and

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
SMU so they didn't get a scene play and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.890 
SMU so they didn't get a scene play and
Russell<00:04:21.000> had<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> terrific<00:04:21.479> season

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
Russell had a terrific season

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.840 
Russell had a terrific season
at<00:04:23.139> Ohio<00:04:23.290> State<00:04:23.919> but<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.400> think<00:04:24.610> there's<00:04:24.759> an

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
at Ohio State but I think there's an

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.719 
at Ohio State but I think there's an
assumption<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.479> recency<00:04:25.930> bias<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.729> because

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
assumption and recency bias that because

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.100 
assumption and recency bias that because
we<00:04:27.880> haven't<00:04:28.030> seen<00:04:28.300> mudiay<00:04:28.630> we<00:04:28.810> don't<00:04:28.960> really

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
we haven't seen mudiay we don't really

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.219 
we haven't seen mudiay we don't really
know<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.860> we're<00:04:30.580> comparing<00:04:30.960> wrestled<00:04:31.960> now

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
know what we're comparing wrestled now

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.529 
know what we're comparing wrestled now
after<00:04:33.009> a<00:04:33.039> year<00:04:33.280> in<00:04:33.370> college<00:04:33.639> with<00:04:33.970> moody<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> out

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
after a year in college with moody a out

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.820 
after a year in college with moody a out
of<00:04:34.630> high<00:04:34.780> school<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.139> really<00:04:35.440> think<00:04:35.620> that's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
of high school I really think that's

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.620 
of high school I really think that's
sort<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> comparison<00:04:36.820> right<00:04:36.970> now<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.449> I

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
sort of the comparison right now and I

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.029 
sort of the comparison right now and I
think<00:04:37.690> he<00:04:37.870> did<00:04:38.110> get<00:04:38.289> better<00:04:38.440> in<00:04:38.650> China<00:04:38.889> I<00:04:38.979> think

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
think he did get better in China I think

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.129 
think he did get better in China I think
he<00:04:39.280> improved<00:04:39.639> his<00:04:39.789> jump<00:04:40.060> shot<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.539> think<00:04:40.810> he

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
he improved his jump shot I think he

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.050 
he improved his jump shot I think he
improved<00:04:41.560> his<00:04:41.740> playmaking<00:04:42.190> ability<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.910> think

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
improved his playmaking ability I think

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.670 
improved his playmaking ability I think
he's<00:04:43.509> gonna<00:04:43.630> cut<00:04:43.930> down<00:04:43.960> on<00:04:44.259> those<00:04:44.410> turnovers

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
he's gonna cut down on those turnovers

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.680 
he's gonna cut down on those turnovers
and<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.490> think<00:04:45.820> that's<00:04:45.970> gonna<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.389> hardest

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
and I think that's gonna be the hardest

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.540 
and I think that's gonna be the hardest
comparison<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.740> we<00:04:47.860> didn't<00:04:48.220> get<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.400> see

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
comparison is that we didn't get to see

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.760 
comparison is that we didn't get to see
mudiay<00:04:48.850> at<00:04:49.030> SMU<00:04:49.479> this<00:04:49.660> year<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:50.530> it's<00:04:50.680> a

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
mudiay at SMU this year and so it's a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.189 
mudiay at SMU this year and so it's a
little<00:04:50.949> bit<00:04:51.130> comparing<00:04:51.699> apples<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:52.090> oranges

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
little bit comparing apples to oranges

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.020
