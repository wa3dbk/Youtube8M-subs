00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 That 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 here is a big one 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.009
 three dead 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.759
 five wounded 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.059
 this disaster has happened 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.719
 a nightmare 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 how much preferred 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.049
 the most fun and away 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.219
 by processing the blow 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.629
 back in the trunk of his car 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.269
 I am 100 meters sight 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.970
 70 kilometers per hour and at 50 meters visibility 50 kilometers per hour 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.829
 you can continue the distance shots on the side of the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:02.389
 away 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.669
 existing 140 meters 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.139
 in a sort of 80 kilometers per hour portimao 80 meters away 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.089
 those are two posts 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.769
 speed that indicates how your people signage is mandatory 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.269
 you build on that 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.269
 extends defensively in fog or poor visibility 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.199
 at least before this you prevent this goal 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.149
 what now
