00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 day love sportscar really really am 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.620
 States it is again a very 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.950
 interesting question and that is the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.389
 ask from other dominik molkenthin and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 he asks me is a week 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.650
 Regeneration too much 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.000
 a week of regeneration is natural 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 first the question he meant every yes 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 every week a unit or a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 principle ration april has its 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 Wisdom, of course, meant a week 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 principle nation whether it makes sense and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 if that is maybe too much and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 In fact I personally find one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.360
 week regeneration actually very good 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.250
 because we just have to go ahead 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 Keep your eyes shut if you like that, for example 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.700
 Batty since like how I am 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.530
 when I'm five six times a week 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.329
 trained for a whole year 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
 In addition , I also miss somewhere 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.100
 the regeneration generally for mine 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 central nervous system for my bones 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.809
 see bands yes it's not just the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.760
 Musculature that somehow recovers and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 also the body is always considered as a whole 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 therefore, of course, to look at organism 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 makes a week of regeneration 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.020
 they can sometimes stop in front of eyes for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 example professional athletes as footballers the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 also have a winter break one 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 sommerpause 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.820
 and I do not think so 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.560
 somewhere on vacation then daily 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 train but the use of these 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.290
 break you see times so pictures 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 was hanging out on the beach or 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 rumgammeln and is also useful then 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.509
 just two weeks absolutely and even 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.240
 nothing to do that the body itself 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.890
 Reason to regenerate you have to now 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 usually make a week break 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.430
 no, you do not have to, you can, of course 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 the whole also different shape it comes 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.080
 Of course, always on your training plan 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.689
 on 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.460
 how intense and how do you train 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.990
 Of course it can not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.159
 generalizing directly but there are 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.530
 also other possibilities if you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 just for example on the holiday page 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.470
 or soya you can easily 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.930
 just adapt that say often - 1 2 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 vacationing nothing it comes anyway 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.070
 Everybody somewhere in the year before that too 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 you might go on vacation and then 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 You should really vacation 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 use to regenerate reason 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.689
 On the other hand, there are also often the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.009
 In case you hurt your illness 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.229
 and if you just have a two 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.729
 weeks then you should the time 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.229
 use to regenerate and still 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.259
 really not like a batty one 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 studio race or somehow the other 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.350
 I will train musculature now 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.090
 I'm totally hurt but there you can 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 also just expose a two 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.599
 weeks and recover yes then comes 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.500
 Of course, on the training plan how 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.060
 already said 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.860
 if we are such a bodybuilder and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 always a very high intensity 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 training always means hypertrophy 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 area or maximalkraft area then 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.270
 you need sometime anyway 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.280
 a break to recover and in the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.990
 rule-it is actually so when 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 you then completely recovered his whole 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.850
 body that you then so yes 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 can overcome so-called plateaus 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.320
 where you might stand still until that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.560
 is called yes if it hofmann injured or 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.390
 what broke and then the muscle 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.040
 for example, a leg was broken 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.660
 because then the muscle will eventually 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.370
 totally goodbye after a few weeks 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.030
 then sometime start again with 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.950
 the training 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 then it is already surprising how 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.130
 quickly this musculature comes again 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.680
 of course you have a kind of memory 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.290
 effect but it is also just that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.459
 he reason yes the body is so recovered 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.989
 that you just go back faster 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.300
 I have noticed that where 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.500
 I had my cell chest and really 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.360
 four five weeks, the breast is not 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.810
 I have been training yesterday 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.190
 for example, nine new levels 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.600
 reached by the weight I at 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.820
 to push more ado managed 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.709
 I've never been there because I'm there 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.170
 Just recovered was as usual 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.880
 and depending on how you train 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.290
 Bank starts as I said you can 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.750
 of course, your training also in general 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 progressively in cycles divide that 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.880
 will also sport science 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.280
 actually recommended so that you said 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.560
 I do certain meso cycles and once 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.480
 per cycle there is a meso cycle 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.489
 would be a training plan for maybe 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.230
 six to eight weeks then you change 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.239
 then again reminds again that one 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.709
 as new stimuli sets and once per 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.870
 For example, cycle fills up 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.549
 half year in which you have five to six 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.410
 There are different training plans there 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.390
 It's so progressive 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.220
 Steiger of hais one starts in force 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.320
 Endurance area with the repetition 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.989
 less strain on bones joints 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.519
 and then crave and tapes for example 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.900
 you go into the hypertrophic and then into 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.880
 then we have the maximum force 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.910
 of course at the maximum force 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.650
 third meso cycle so to speak elevated 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.690
 stress also for central nervous system 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.579
 we train there intramuscularly 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.810
 that is who we try so much there 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.549
 to create as possible 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.620
 Of course, there is also a higher one there 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.329
 load due to the weights on the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.390
 Steer on the ribbons on the lakes 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.520
 anyway, and then have progressive 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.020
 Increasing training makes sense 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.170
 the maximum power if you are there 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.360
 four to six weeks 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.490
 max avoided training to change again 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.990
 on the strength endurance that is like a 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.610
 loose training more repetitions 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.200
 less weight just so that the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.480
 claimed things like the central 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.160
 nervous system the bones the ligaments the 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.690
 see also recover and then you can 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.950
 it's finally progressive again 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.450
 it's a very simple step up 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.370
 for example, this progressive increase 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.410
 because of endurance hypertrophy 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.730
 then maximum strength training and then 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.500
 the whole again from the beginning 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.030
 to rebuild his body as well 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.770
 Regenerate that is one possibility 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.060
 bodybuilders may think so 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.960
 you just have to change that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.030
 look that maybe with it 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.890
 really uses the holiday or one 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.660
 week off most exercise 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.120
 not necessarily in these 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.370
 but progressive gains 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.090
 As a rule, it makes sense, of course 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.590
 to train 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.360
 but you can not go back for that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.410
 general and say fits every end 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.120
 six weeks my workout schedule 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.010
 of course you have to look like it 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.810
 my level continues to rise 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.160
 I can still wait two weeks 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.570
 maybe hang on it before I mean 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.730
 change training plan again 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.530
 at the maximalkraft, however, I think 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.940
 you should not overdo it 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.980
 maybe not four to six 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.090
 do the whole week out because we are 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.250
 here simply an increased load 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.000
 have to at the end again ask the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.860
 return 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.050
 a week break definitely makes 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.640
 sense the question is how the shape if it 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.620
 Holiday is if we are sick 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.300
 has injury or if he falls off her 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.250
 Training also designed so that you 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.540
 my time off indulges with my art 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.580
 maintenance training by the 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.230
 endurance a few weeks and then 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.210
 again the full weight increases 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.860
 There are different possibilities 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.030
 I like it a bit 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.830
 strength endurance in between 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.570
 to contribute to my body reason 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.280
 merck works as well 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.320
 Generally, maybe once a year 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.570
 an injury or illness or 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.650
 sometimes a few days on the road and 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.360
 then you have to do it 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.160
 the brain fits together on Doing 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.840
 next time I find it hard 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.100
 a little mental crack that one 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.840
 despite everything, something increases with 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.510
 you should learn to train there 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.790
 that since the break begrudge the 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.050
 Rest really like to take a couple 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.230
 days and then you get full again 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.210
 attacks because of this is good break week 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.690
 usually not that way 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.650
 bad 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.640
 I hope I could get you there 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.220
 You can help me a little bit further 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.840
 like to ask a few more questions 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.610
 As for training planning, above all 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.570
 and yes I would of course over
