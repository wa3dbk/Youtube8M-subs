honest<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.080> was<00:00:10.260> surprised<00:00:10.679> by<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.040> pics<00:00:11.610> from

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
honest I was surprised by the pics from

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.289 
honest I was surprised by the pics from
team<00:00:12.540> CM<00:00:12.870> Punk<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> little<00:00:14.759> less<00:00:14.910> surprised

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
team CM Punk and a little less surprised

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
team CM Punk and a little less surprised
from<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> pics<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.440> team<00:00:16.650> ik<00:00:16.830> Foley<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
from the pics of team ik Foley because I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.279 
from the pics of team ik Foley because I
thought<00:00:17.670> Foley's<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.150> more<00:00:18.359> predictable<00:00:18.779> then

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
thought Foley's is more predictable then

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.630 
thought Foley's is more predictable then
punks<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:22.410> seems<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
punks was but it seems like a lot of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.080 
punks was but it seems like a lot of
people<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:25.369> more<00:00:26.369> concerned<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
people are a more concerned about a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
people are a more concerned about a
pay-per-view<00:00:27.480> without<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> title<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pay-per-view without the title on the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980 
pay-per-view without the title on the
line<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> hasn't<00:00:30.179> been<00:00:30.390> done<00:00:30.599> before

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
line not that it hasn't been done before

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.160 
line not that it hasn't been done before
but<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.489> fact<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> Punk<00:00:33.540> picked<00:00:33.870> guys<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but the fact that Punk picked guys I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.940 
but the fact that Punk picked guys I
think<00:00:34.469> who<00:00:34.980> haven't<00:00:35.489> really<00:00:36.410> deserve<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.680> spot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
think who haven't really deserve a spot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.580 
think who haven't really deserve a spot
on<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.460> team<00:00:38.760> rather<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:40.020> picking<00:00:40.290> guys

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
on that team rather than picking guys

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
on that team rather than picking guys
who<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.210> consider<00:00:42.600> being<00:00:43.079> on

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
who you know you would consider being on

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
who you know you would consider being on
the<00:00:43.379> same<00:00:43.530> level<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> CM<00:00:44.280> Punk<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.690> think

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the same level of CM Punk and I think

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.750 
the same level of CM Punk and I think
when<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> put<00:00:46.320> guys<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.829> MS<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.550> Del

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
when you put guys like the MS and in Del

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.560 
when you put guys like the MS and in Del
Rio<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.739> more<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.550> miss<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
Rio and it's more than you know miss and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
Rio and it's more than you know miss and
Del<00:00:51.809> Rio<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> two<00:00:52.860> guys<00:00:53.070> who

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
Del Rio I think are the two guys who

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.720 
Del Rio I think are the two guys who
really<00:00:53.489> bring<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> team's<00:00:54.660> credibility<00:00:55.379> down

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
really bring the team's credibility down

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
really bring the team's credibility down
considering<00:00:56.730> Road<00:00:57.239> scholars<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.960> pretty

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
considering Road scholars are pretty

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.840 
considering Road scholars are pretty
much<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> winning<00:00:59.100> streak<00:00:59.340> they've<00:00:59.579> been

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
much on a winning streak they've been

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.279 
much on a winning streak they've been
proving<00:01:00.420> themselves<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> tag<00:01:01.260> team

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
proving themselves in the tag team

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
proving themselves in the tag team
division<00:01:01.469> they've<00:01:02.039> been<00:01:02.309> winning<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
division they've been winning for the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.649 
division they've been winning for the
most<00:01:03.570> part<00:01:03.979> where<00:01:04.979> del<00:01:05.189> Rio<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> came<00:01:06.450> off

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
most part where del Rio kind of came off

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.450 
most part where del Rio kind of came off

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the biggest caliber of superstar on the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.309 
the biggest caliber of superstar on the
roster<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:33.180> are<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> team<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.110> has<00:02:34.290> been

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
consistently winning and I think that's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.360 
consistently winning and I think that's
what<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> Survivor<00:02:36.480> Series<00:02:36.750> team<00:02:37.020> should<00:02:37.370> you

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
and I know winds don't matter but I

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.860 
and I know winds don't matter but I
think<00:04:43.780> when<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.080> comes<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:45.000> five<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.030> five<00:04:46.510> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
think when it comes to five on five I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.750 
think when it comes to five on five I
think<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.710> advantage<00:04:47.920> really<00:04:48.310> goes<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
think the advantage really goes to the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.460 
think the advantage really goes to the
guys<00:04:48.910> who<00:04:49.150> really<00:04:49.450> built<00:04:49.690> their<00:04:49.990> name<00:04:50.200> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
