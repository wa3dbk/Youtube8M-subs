but I'm just gonna give you a idea of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.770 
but I'm just gonna give you a idea of
how<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:13.740> three<00:00:14.099> games<00:00:14.370> play<00:00:14.790> basically<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
how these three games play basically the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.170 
how these three games play basically the
app<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.260> divided<00:00:16.740> into<00:00:16.980> three<00:00:17.190> mini-games<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
app is divided into three mini-games the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.450 
app is divided into three mini-games the
first<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> based<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.800> actual<00:00:20.100> game

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
first is based off of the actual game

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
first is based off of the actual game
from<00:00:20.699> wreckit-ralph<00:00:21.080> called<00:00:22.080> fix-it<00:00:22.410> Felix

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
from wreckit-ralph called fix-it Felix

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
from wreckit-ralph called fix-it Felix
jr.<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.760> meant<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.060> evoke<00:00:24.359> feelings

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
jr. and this is meant to evoke feelings

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620 
jr. and this is meant to evoke feelings
from<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.400> Donkey<00:00:26.760> Kong<00:00:26.910> Country<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
from you know Donkey Kong Country and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.620 
from you know Donkey Kong Country and
Mario<00:00:27.960> Brothers<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.859> old<00:00:29.300> arcade<00:00:30.300> games

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
Mario Brothers and very old arcade games

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.410 
Mario Brothers and very old arcade games
the<00:00:31.199> idea<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.489> record<00:00:32.910> Ralph<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the idea is is that you record Ralph is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240 
the idea is is that you record Ralph is
here<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.840> has<00:00:33.930> broken<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.440> lot<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.680> windows<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
here and has broken a lot of windows and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.049 
here and has broken a lot of windows and
you<00:00:35.370> were<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:36.110> fixing<00:00:37.110> windows<00:00:37.790> on<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you were gonna be fixing windows on the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
you were gonna be fixing windows on the
apartment<00:00:39.270> complex<00:00:39.840> while<00:00:40.050> avoiding<00:00:40.559> things

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
apartment complex while avoiding things

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
apartment complex while avoiding things
like<00:00:40.920> Ralph's<00:00:41.250> throwing<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.730> bricks<00:00:42.090> very

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
like Ralph's throwing down bricks very

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.490 
like Ralph's throwing down bricks very
old-school<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:44.579> main<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.809> criticisms<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
old-school the main kind of criticisms I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.619 
old-school the main kind of criticisms I
had<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.520> evokes<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> old<00:00:48.239> school<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
had is that it evokes the old school a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
had is that it evokes the old school a
little<00:00:48.840> too<00:00:49.140> much<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> sense<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
little too much in the sense that it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.790 
little too much in the sense that it's
very<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.149> repetitive<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:52.320> fixed<00:00:52.590> all

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
very very very repetitive I've fixed all

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.319 
very very very repetitive I've fixed all
the<00:00:52.890> windows<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> level<00:00:53.670> move<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the windows on the level move up to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
the windows on the level move up to
another<00:00:54.600> level<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.620> windows<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
another level with more windows and this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.330 
another level with more windows and this
is<00:00:56.850> pretty<00:00:57.030> much<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> entirety<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> game

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
is pretty much the entirety of the game

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.349 
is pretty much the entirety of the game
eventually<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.520> gonna<00:00:59.579> come<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.059> some

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
eventually you're gonna come do some

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.750 
eventually you're gonna come do some
obstacles<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.829> door<00:01:02.100> shutters<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
obstacles like these door shutters or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
obstacles like these door shutters or
window<00:01:03.000> shutters<00:01:03.300> rather<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
window shutters rather that are going to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.660 
window shutters rather that are going to
keep<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.619> moving<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> side

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
keep you from moving the side to side

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.050 
keep you from moving the side to side
and<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:07.280> planters<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.369> keep<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:08.729> moving

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and a planters that keep you from moving

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.370 
and a planters that keep you from moving
up<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.290> I'm

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
up and down so as you can see I'm

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
up and down so as you can see I'm
swiping<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> can't<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> okay

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
swiping up and I can't go up so okay

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.270 
swiping up and I can't go up so okay
it's<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.939> continue<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> another<00:01:15.600> level

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
it's gonna continue on to another level

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
it's gonna continue on to another level
again<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.729> simplistic<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:19.560> easy<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.979> pick

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
again very simplistic very easy to pick

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
again very simplistic very easy to pick
up<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.430> play<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.060> again<00:01:21.390> unless<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
up and play but again unless you're a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
up and play but again unless you're a
huge<00:01:22.530> fan<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.130> old<00:01:23.490> arcade<00:01:23.939> games<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
huge fan of those old arcade games that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.950 
huge fan of those old arcade games that
are<00:01:24.799> kind<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> repetitive<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.430> nature<00:01:26.960> you're

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
are kind of repetitive in nature you're

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
are kind of repetitive in nature you're
not<00:01:28.110> gonna<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.890> entertainment<00:01:29.700> out

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
not gonna get a lot of entertainment out

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
not gonna get a lot of entertainment out
of<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.200> exit

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
of this so I'm just gonna actually exit

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.560 
of this so I'm just gonna actually exit
out<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> another<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> games

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
out and go to another one of the games

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
out and go to another one of the games
actually<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> watch<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> cutscene

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
actually I'm going to watch the cutscene

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.580 
actually I'm going to watch the cutscene
here

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.870 

another<00:01:42.220> thing<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.400> didn't<00:01:42.580> really<00:01:42.670> like<00:01:42.850> about

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
another thing I didn't really like about

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.490 
another thing I didn't really like about
this<00:01:43.119> game<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.690> kind<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.869> omits<00:01:44.229> the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
this game is that it kind of omits the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.130 
this game is that it kind of omits the
catchphrases<00:01:45.400> from<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.760> movie<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:47.020> it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
catchphrases from the movie so it
