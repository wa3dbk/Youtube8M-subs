00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
huge fan of plant protein source but at

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.069 
huge fan of plant protein source but at
the<00:03:14.579> same<00:03:14.730> time<00:03:14.939> it'll<00:03:15.329> definitely<00:03:15.510> help<00:03:15.870> in

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079

the<00:03:16.200> high<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.680> fiber<00:03:16.859> as<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.190> said<00:03:18.199> because<00:03:19.199> our

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
the high in fiber as I said because our

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.990 
the high in fiber as I said because our
rice<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.530> cooked<00:03:19.919> this<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.459> all<00:03:20.609> going<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.909> come

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
rice is cooked this is all going to come

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.969 
rice is cooked this is all going to come
together<00:03:21.120> very<00:03:21.329> quickly<00:03:21.599> now<00:03:22.199> if<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.769> if

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
together very quickly now if it's a if

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.259 
together very quickly now if it's a if
it<00:03:23.129> needs<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.370> little<00:03:23.489> bit<00:03:23.609> more<00:03:23.819> liquid<00:03:24.030> you
