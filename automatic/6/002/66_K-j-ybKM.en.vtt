00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.300 

I<00:00:04.509> raised<00:00:05.509> a<00:00:05.720> medication<00:00:06.290> really<00:00:06.920> has<00:00:07.040> been

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
I raised a medication really has been

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
I raised a medication really has been
pretty<00:00:07.910> prevalent<00:00:08.270> for<00:00:09.250> over<00:00:10.250> 20<00:00:10.610> years<00:00:10.639> I

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
pretty prevalent for over 20 years I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.700 
pretty prevalent for over 20 years I
know<00:00:11.679> New<00:00:12.679> York<00:00:12.980> as<00:00:13.280> I<00:00:13.550> recall<00:00:13.940> was<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.240> last

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
know New York as I recall was the last

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.679 
know New York as I recall was the last
to<00:00:15.710> legalize<00:00:16.219> lasix<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.060> I<00:00:17.150> think<00:00:17.360> that<00:00:17.540> was

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
to legalize lasix and I think that was

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.990 
to legalize lasix and I think that was
about<00:00:17.810> 92<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.009> now<00:00:19.250> we've<00:00:19.490> got<00:00:19.700> a<00:00:19.730> whole

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
about 92 so now we've got a whole

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.050 
about 92 so now we've got a whole
generation<00:00:20.270> of<00:00:20.930> horses<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:22.189> are<00:00:22.430> hooked<00:00:22.640> if

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
generation of horses that are hooked if

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.470 
generation of horses that are hooked if
you<00:00:23.300> will<00:00:23.509> on<00:00:23.810> race<00:00:24.439> day<00:00:24.710> medication<00:00:25.520> if<00:00:26.239> you

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
you will on race day medication if you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.960 
you will on race day medication if you
look<00:00:26.689> at<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.989> total<00:00:27.349> number<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.739> starts<00:00:28.279> per

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
look at the total number of starts per

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.080 
look at the total number of starts per
horse<00:00:29.270> total<00:00:30.079> number<00:00:30.380> starts<00:00:30.860> per<00:00:31.099> year<00:00:31.430> it's

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
horse total number starts per year it's

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.350 
horse total number starts per year it's
gone<00:00:32.450> down<00:00:32.840> every<00:00:33.200> year<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:35.000> pretty

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
gone down every year and it's pretty

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.750 
gone down every year and it's pretty
obvious<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:36.020> me<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:36.470> race<00:00:36.710> day<00:00:36.980> medication

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
obvious to me what race day medication

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.050 
obvious to me what race day medication
has<00:00:38.060> done<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.990> horse<00:00:39.200> population<00:00:40.060> well

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
has done to the horse population well

training from mr. Stevens was quite a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.730 
training from mr. Stevens was quite a
lot<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.610> feel<00:01:49.970> even<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.780> just<00:01:51.229> was<00:01:51.500> through

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
lot I feel even if it just was through

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.640 
lot I feel even if it just was through
the<00:01:51.860> process<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.549> osmosis<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:54.380> thing

the process of osmosis and the one thing
that<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.890> did<00:01:55.189> learn<00:01:55.460> was<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.939> you<00:01:56.060> didn't

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
that I did learn was that you didn't

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.030 
that I did learn was that you didn't

the trainer's of today might tell you
that<00:02:45.569> well<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.230> horses<00:02:46.500> are<00:02:46.769> too<00:02:46.950> soft<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that well the horses are too soft and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.280 
that well the horses are too soft and
there's<00:02:47.909> no<00:02:48.120> way<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.930> run<00:02:49.109> them

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
there's no way that you can run them

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.679 
there's no way that you can run them
back<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.739> quick<00:02:50.269> really<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.299> probably

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
back that quick really I probably

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.660 
back that quick really I probably
wouldn't<00:02:52.019> argue<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.500> point<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.280> isn't<00:02:53.579> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
wouldn't argue that point but isn't the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.460 
wouldn't argue that point but isn't the
reason<00:02:53.849> that<00:02:54.120> they're<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:54.510> soft<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.109> because

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
reason that they're so soft is because

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.409 
reason that they're so soft is because
we've<00:02:55.680> used<00:02:55.919> all<00:02:56.159> this<00:02:56.370> medication<00:02:56.939> for<00:02:57.180> over

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
we've used all this medication for over

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.409 
we've used all this medication for over
a<00:02:57.689> generation<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.680> mean<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.730> me<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.389> the

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
a generation I mean to me that is the

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.390 
a generation I mean to me that is the
crux<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.169> matter<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:01.799> we<00:03:01.950> keep<00:03:02.159> going

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
crux of the matter and if we keep going

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.330 
crux of the matter and if we keep going
the<00:03:02.700> way<00:03:02.849> we're<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.769> another<00:03:04.769> generation

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
the way we're going another generation

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
the way we're going another generation
goes<00:03:05.730> by<00:03:06.000> it's<00:03:06.359> going<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> even<00:03:07.169> worse

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
goes by it's going to be a even worse

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.640 
goes by it's going to be a even worse
problem<00:03:07.739> than<00:03:08.129> what<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.549> right<00:03:08.970> now<00:03:09.290> as<00:03:10.290> far

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
problem than what it is right now as far

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.399
