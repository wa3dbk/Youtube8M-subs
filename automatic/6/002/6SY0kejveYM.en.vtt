00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.859
 today for this special look 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.270
 spring and forget the beautiful days 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.179
 arrive and I wanted to make you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.389
 a colorful look in collaboration with his 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 shop you see with this magnificent 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.270
 blue makeup I would be happy to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.859
 do this collaboration with her 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.630
 I hope you enjoy me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 mastery that we are under the bar of a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 flow then to start this look I 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 will apply a concealer since 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 clear as incarnation on everything 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 the whole of my eyelid and I'm going to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.559
 fix with powder 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.880
 it's going to be used as an eyelid base for 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.250
 bring out the colors and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
 to make sure that you had no basis 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
 you bought in store then 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.440
 Then I will take the palette mcit 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 3 and I'm going to take the lighthouse buzz on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 goes out in pink 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.660
 fight and that I'm going to apply on 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 the entire mobile eyelid 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.989
 so the best is to apply 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 really as you go 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.510
 to apply some stuff 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.100
 because it's true that on the headlights 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.960
 of not fulfilling all the help 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.370
 banks it besides we have a lot of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 falls 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.619
 then I took the lighthouse factory is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.330
 a kind of glitter vionnet with 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.790
 under your pink and I apply them on 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.310
 the entire eyelid still with a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.740
 brush blurs hours so a brush to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 broad enough hair and that allows you to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.780
 to mix while making movements 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 circular 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 then you are in good time to mix 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380
 I'm going to take a lighthouse a little bit more 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 dark is the far dark side on the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 same palette and I'm going to apply it to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.320
 center ie between the eyelid 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 mobile the eyelid still and I'm going 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.860
 take a fluffy brush all over 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.960
 what way and what we lose a little 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810
 will mix mix mix then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.820
 the lighthouse dust which is a powdery pink 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.549
 very not been and I'm going to put them in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.070
 the inner corner of the eye brought back a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.710
 little light on that yields a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.170
 little freshness when you do that to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.420
 interior 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.400
 after if you have eyes really 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.430
 bring closer I advise you not to 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.110
 do it but otherwise it is to define a 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.759
 little light is very fine very very 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.409
 beautiful we will trace the eyeliner with an eye 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.450
 blue liner so I chose the color 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.360
 blue to really bring back from the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.880
 color and break the pink side so 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.860
 this is the ultimate payne from kiko that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.670
 I love it I love it I love the master in summer 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.950
 who is beautiful 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.090
 so you trace will have decided in a 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.910
 first time you do not do the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.269
 climb trace just flush the eyelashes a 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.200
 trait and then you go back up the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.959
 points to sourcing and their descent 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.000
 that is, catch up with the rest of 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.260
 the eyeliner down from it actually the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.510
 same thing on the other side 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.190
 so of course liner it takes 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.049
 training then I applied 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.209
 but fossils off camera discarded 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.450
 hardel and I took my pencil cajole 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.209
 blue also from tiko who is a blue 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 which is getting closer to the liner and that is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 applied on the mucous membrane as a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.459
 black pencil so do not worry 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.799
 it's not in aggressive blue it's rather 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.109
 a blue a real blues actually it's a 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.350
 blinis and not a blue tropez then 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.790
 I took my blue mascara waste slip 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.010
 to stay in this dance is color 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.430
 and I just apply it to the flush 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 bottom eyelashes really to put in 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 before the blue then I took my 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.769
 favorite blache of the moment 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.630
 so these two men in orange of a 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.780
 scene at will beall cosmetics 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 I love these dubbing to warm a 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.410
 little complexion but to make 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.579
 you see we're still blue 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.739
 pink than orange 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.290
 but these two colors that agree 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.140
 then I took my brown pencil 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.200
 at mac match and net it's a brown 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.709
 with sub tuna red that I love 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.480
 to apply nude lipsticks 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.280
 and especially he has very good skin 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.109
 black and you apply it you do 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.550
 the outline very carefully as and 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.170
 as you go 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.130
 much more accurate and I will take 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.590
 my red using 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.900
 kiko 601 which is varnish which is a 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.490
 matte hugues that I like a lot too 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.450
 that I used are hospitals of 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.490
 very beautiful bride so vote as 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.270
 and as you go on the pencil to have a 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.190
 natural effect 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.610
 I added a gloss that I bought 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.610
 at h &amp; m 2 euros in the middle and the look 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.130
 is over now this look is over 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.480
 some will displease for happiness it's 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.930
 the first but I tell you to the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.930
 next
