I'm<00:00:12.200> here<00:00:12.379> today<00:00:12.590> to<00:00:12.710> talk<00:00:13.009> about

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I'm here today to talk about

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.939 
I'm here today to talk about
and<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.700> lens<00:00:15.030> calibration<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.619> know<00:00:16.740> we

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and that is lens calibration you know we

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.500 
and that is lens calibration you know we
go<00:00:17.070> out<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.610> buy<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.939> really<00:00:18.240> fancy

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
go out and we buy these really fancy

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.500 
go out and we buy these really fancy
expensive<00:00:19.010> lenses<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:21.090> order<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.390> make

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
expensive lenses and in order to make

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
expensive lenses and in order to make
sure<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.750> we're<00:00:21.900> getting<00:00:21.990> absolute<00:00:22.710> maximum

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
sure that we're getting absolute maximum

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.350 
sure that we're getting absolute maximum
sharpness<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> them<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.180> really

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
sharpness out of them it's really

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.790 
sharpness out of them it's really
important<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> calibrate<00:00:25.200> your<00:00:25.439> lenses

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
important that you calibrate your lenses

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
important that you calibrate your lenses
the<00:00:26.369> last<00:00:26.550> few<00:00:26.730> generations<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.419> cameras<00:00:27.869> have

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the last few generations of cameras have

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.310 
the last few generations of cameras have
allowed<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:29.300> calibrate<00:00:30.300> each<00:00:30.539> individual

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
allowed you to calibrate each individual

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
allowed you to calibrate each individual
lens<00:00:31.560> even<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> lens<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.519> a<00:00:32.550> teleconverter<00:00:33.239> or

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
lens even a lens with a teleconverter or

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.470 
lens even a lens with a teleconverter or
without<00:00:34.019> a<00:00:34.080> patella<00:00:34.410> converter<00:00:34.769> so<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
without a patella converter so that the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
without a patella converter so that the
cameras<00:00:36.900> focusing<00:00:37.440> ability<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> absolutely

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
cameras focusing ability is absolutely

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.470 
cameras focusing ability is absolutely
perfect<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:39.900> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.769> this<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
perfect now you can do this with just a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.900 
perfect now you can do this with just a
ruler<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.290> something<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.730> there's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ruler or something like that but there's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
ruler or something like that but there's
some<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.239> cool<00:00:45.390> devices<00:00:45.930> I've<00:00:46.079> got<00:00:46.230> one

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
some really cool devices I've got one

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.709 
some really cool devices I've got one
here<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> spider<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> spider<00:00:48.360> lens

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
here by a spider it's the spider lens

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
here by a spider it's the spider lens
cow<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.309> help<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
cow which really help you to do this a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
cow which really help you to do this a
lot<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.989> accurately<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.430> bit

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
lot more accurately and a little bit

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.689 
lot more accurately and a little bit
easier<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> let's<00:00:55.140> take<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:55.890> what's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
easier so let's take a look here what's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.439 
easier so let's take a look here what's
in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> box<00:00:57.239> here<00:01:00.230> basically<00:01:01.230> we've<00:01:01.980> got<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
in the box here basically we've got the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.160 
in the box here basically we've got the
lens<00:01:03.930> cowl<00:01:04.229> unit<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.869> it's<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.020> rocket

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
lens cowl unit here and it's not rocket

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.430 
lens cowl unit here and it's not rocket
science<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.920> clips<00:01:08.130> together<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
science just clips together like this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.230 
science just clips together like this
and<00:01:10.440> all<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.190> need<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.700> set<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> up

and all you need to do is set this up
you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> either<00:01:12.720> set<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.899> up<00:01:13.050> on<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> flat

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
you can either set it up on a flat

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.219 
you can either set it up on a flat
surface<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.340> use<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:15.179> tripod<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
surface or you can use a tripod or a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.310 
surface or you can use a tripod or a
stand<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> level<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.550> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.320> all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
stand it's got a level on here and all

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.600 
stand it's got a level on here and all
you<00:01:19.439> need<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> focus<00:01:20.460> your

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you need to do then is to focus your

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.200 
you need to do then is to focus your
camera<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:23.210> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
camera right here or right here and this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
camera right here or right here and this
device<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> tell<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> whether<00:01:25.350> or

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
device is going to tell you whether or

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
device is going to tell you whether or
not<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.830> lens<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.520> focusing<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
not your lens is actually focusing in

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
not your lens is actually focusing in
front<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> subject<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:27.960> behind<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
front of the subject or behind the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
front of the subject or behind the
subject<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.060> camera's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
subject you can then use your camera's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
subject you can then use your camera's
lens<00:01:30.750> calibration<00:01:31.650> setting<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.490> dial<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
lens calibration setting to dial it in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
lens calibration setting to dial it in
just<00:01:33.299> perfectly<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> enable<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> absolute

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just perfectly and enable the absolute

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920 
just perfectly and enable the absolute
maximum<00:01:35.790> sharpness<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.600> lens<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
maximum sharpness that your lens is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.410 
maximum sharpness that your lens is
capable<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:38.850> at<00:01:39.090> how

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
capable of so let's take a look at how

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.190 
capable of so let's take a look at how
this<00:01:39.570> works<00:01:40.759> we'll<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.030> set<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.570> 500

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this works we'll get it set up on my 500

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.240 
this works we'll get it set up on my 500
millimeter<00:01:45.229> okay<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.890> here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
millimeter okay so as you can see here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
millimeter okay so as you can see here
now<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> lens<00:01:48.390> cowl<00:01:48.720> unit<00:01:49.170> set<00:01:49.380> up

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
now I've got the lens cowl unit set up

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
now I've got the lens cowl unit set up
on<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> stand<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.460> been<00:01:50.610> leveled<00:01:53.600> okay<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
on a stand and it's been leveled okay so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.359 
on a stand and it's been leveled okay so
I've<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.170> lens<00:01:55.380> set<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I've got my lens set up here now this is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.429 
I've got my lens set up here now this is
a<00:01:56.430> 500<00:01:56.909> millimeter<00:01:57.299> I've<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> 1.4

converter on here and I'm using my Canon
7d<00:02:00.659> I've<00:02:01.649> set<00:02:01.890> myself<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.340> exactly<00:02:02.969> parallel

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
7d I've set myself up exactly parallel

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
7d I've set myself up exactly parallel
with<00:02:03.810> our<00:02:04.020> target<00:02:04.229> down<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:05.610> I'm

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
with our target down there and what I'm

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.039 
with our target down there and what I'm
gonna<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.909> now<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.570> ahead<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
gonna do now is I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.509 
gonna do now is I'm gonna go ahead and
focus<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> target<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.310> some

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
focus on the target and take some

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.060 
focus on the target and take some
pictures<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:09.479> enabled<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.229> cameras<00:02:10.739> mirror

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
pictures I've enabled the cameras mirror

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.560 
pictures I've enabled the cameras mirror
lock-up<00:02:11.280> function<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.030> make<00:02:12.180> sure<00:02:12.329> there's<00:02:12.480> no

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
lock-up function to make sure there's no

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.150 
lock-up function to make sure there's no
vibrations<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.380> I'm<00:02:13.470> also<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
vibrations and I'm also going to use the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.190 
vibrations and I'm also going to use the
two<00:02:14.310> second<00:02:14.670> timer<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.239> make<00:02:15.390> sure<00:02:15.570> that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
two second timer just to make sure that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720 
two second timer just to make sure that
hopefully<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
hopefully the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.369 
hopefully the
images<00:02:18.000> are<00:02:18.120> sharp<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.290> have

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
images are sharp so that we have

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.369 
images are sharp so that we have
something<00:02:19.650> good<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.920> add<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.310> analyze<00:02:21.379> and

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
something good to add to analyze and

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.509 
something good to add to analyze and
then<00:02:22.409> we're<00:02:22.620> gonna<00:02:22.709> be<00:02:22.860> able<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.129> see<00:02:23.310> whether

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
then we're gonna be able to see whether

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.009 
then we're gonna be able to see whether
or<00:02:23.610> not<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.849> cameras<00:02:24.180> focusing<00:02:24.629> right<00:02:24.840> on

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
or not the cameras focusing right on

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.990 
or not the cameras focusing right on
zero<00:02:25.319> right<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.860> target<00:02:26.069> or<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.819> in

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
zero right on the target or is it in

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.759 
zero right on the target or is it in
front<00:02:27.299> or<00:02:27.510> behind<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.319> we'll<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.560> able<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
front or behind and we'll be able to

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.960 
front or behind and we'll be able to
adjust<00:02:28.860> accordingly

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
adjust accordingly

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.890 
adjust accordingly
so<00:02:30.120> let's<00:02:30.269> go<00:02:30.360> ahead<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.599> take<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> few

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
so let's go ahead and take a few

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.140 
so let's go ahead and take a few
pictures<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:38.730> we're<00:02:38.849> gonna<00:02:38.970> look

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
pictures here and now we're gonna look

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.970 
pictures here and now we're gonna look
and<00:02:39.299> see<00:02:39.360> what<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.690> results<00:02:40.019> look<00:02:40.049> like

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.710 

okay<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:43.760> let's<00:02:44.000> go<00:02:44.120> ahead<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.390> take<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> look

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
okay so let's go ahead and take a look

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.110 
okay so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:44.840> those<00:02:44.959> results<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.920> hit<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.849> player

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
at those results here I hit the player

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.020 
at those results here I hit the player
button<00:02:47.330> here<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.260> target<00:02:48.620> there

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
button here you can see the target there

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.100 
button here you can see the target there
if<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.180> zoom<00:02:50.209> right<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.660> now<00:02:50.810> you're<00:02:50.959> probably

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
if we zoom right in now you're probably

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
if we zoom right in now you're probably
not<00:02:51.319> gonna<00:02:51.470> believe<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:52.010> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> video<00:02:52.400> but

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
not gonna believe this on the video but

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.820 
not gonna believe this on the video but
if<00:02:52.849> we<00:02:52.970> zoom<00:02:53.000> right<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:54.500> can<00:02:54.650> actually

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
if we zoom right in here we can actually

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.790 
if we zoom right in here we can actually
see<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:56.030> appears<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.410> lens<00:02:57.650> is

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
see that it appears that the lens is

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280 
see that it appears that the lens is
focusing<00:02:58.280> pretty<00:02:58.550> pretty<00:02:58.970> good<00:02:59.239> but<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.050> may

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
focusing pretty pretty good but it may

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.170 
focusing pretty pretty good but it may
be<00:03:00.349> focusing<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.010> little<00:03:01.160> bit<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.489> front<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
be focusing a little bit in front of the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.350 
be focusing a little bit in front of the
actual<00:03:02.540> target<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> what<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:05.209> into

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
actual target so what we can do go into

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.140 
actual target so what we can do go into
the<00:03:05.480> menu<00:03:06.099> go<00:03:07.099> into<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> custom<00:03:07.700> functions

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
the menu go into the custom functions

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.410 
the menu go into the custom functions
and<00:03:08.390> into<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.630> auto<00:03:08.840> focus<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.420> custom

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and into the auto focus and custom

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.619 
and into the auto focus and custom
function<00:03:11.840> here<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:13.610> auto<00:03:13.760> focus<00:03:14.030> micro

function here for the auto focus micro

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.350 
function here for the auto focus micro
adjustment<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.650> adjust<00:03:16.010> by<00:03:16.220> lens<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.299> if

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
adjustment we can adjust by lens so if

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.199 
adjustment we can adjust by lens so if
we<00:03:17.450> hit<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:18.799> we<00:03:18.950> hit<00:03:19.069> info<00:03:19.519> it's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
we hit that and then we hit info it's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.210 
we hit that and then we hit info it's
going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.510> allow<00:03:20.720> us<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:20.989> adjust<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.040> focus

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
going to allow us to adjust the focus

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.640 
going to allow us to adjust the focus
either<00:03:22.579> further<00:03:23.000> away<00:03:23.360> or<00:03:23.599> closer<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
either further away or closer to the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.100 
either further away or closer to the
camera<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.329> really<00:03:26.329> dial<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.049> that

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
camera and really dial that in so that

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.350 
camera and really dial that in so that
we<00:03:27.230> get<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.560> absolute<00:03:27.650> best<00:03:28.160> performance<00:03:28.819> so

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
we get the absolute best performance so

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.120 
we get the absolute best performance so
I'm<00:03:29.450> gonna<00:03:29.540> go<00:03:29.750> ahead<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:29.959> do<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.349> then<00:03:30.980> I'm

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
I'm gonna go ahead and do that then I'm

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.009 
I'm gonna go ahead and do that then I'm
gonna<00:03:31.250> do<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.489> again<00:03:31.610> for<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.180> lens<00:03:32.540> without

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
gonna do it again for the lens without

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.990 
gonna do it again for the lens without
the<00:03:33.170> teleconverter<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.160> I'm<00:03:34.640> gonna<00:03:34.790> do<00:03:34.910> all

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
the teleconverter and I'm gonna do all

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.309 
the teleconverter and I'm gonna do all
my<00:03:35.090> other<00:03:35.239> lenses<00:03:35.660> too<00:03:35.810> because<00:03:36.049> this<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
my other lenses too because this is a

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.140 
my other lenses too because this is a
really<00:03:36.620> important<00:03:37.040> thing<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.519> make<00:03:37.910> sure<00:03:37.940> that

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
really important thing to make sure that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.390 
really important thing to make sure that
you<00:03:38.209> get<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.420> absolute<00:03:38.690> most<00:03:38.840> out<00:03:39.319> of<00:03:39.400> these

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
you get the absolute most out of these

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.420 
you get the absolute most out of these
expensive<00:03:41.000> lenses<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.420> you're<00:03:41.540> buying<00:03:42.430> okay

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
expensive lenses that you're buying okay

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.880 
expensive lenses that you're buying okay
so<00:03:43.610> after<00:03:44.000> some<00:03:44.450> thorough<00:03:44.720> testing<00:03:45.319> it<00:03:45.709> turns

out<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.190> my<00:03:46.310> lenses<00:03:46.610> were<00:03:46.760> actually<00:03:47.060> pretty

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
out that my lenses were actually pretty

out that my lenses were actually pretty

I<00:03:51.560> left<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.220> setting<00:03:52.489> at<00:03:52.609> zero<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
I left the setting at zero and with the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620

found<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.730> lens<00:03:58.970> was<00:03:59.120> front<00:03:59.480> focusing

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
found that the lens was front focusing

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.020 
found that the lens was front focusing
just<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.290> little<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:00.709> but<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.519> just<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.910> little

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
just a little bit but that just a little

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.400 
just a little bit but that just a little
bit<00:04:02.150> could<00:04:02.420> make<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.569> difference<00:04:02.959> between<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
bit could make a difference between the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.890 
bit could make a difference between the
absolute<00:04:03.709> sharpest<00:04:04.280> shot<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.730> not<00:04:05.359> so<00:04:05.600> great

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
absolute sharpest shot and not so great

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.530 
absolute sharpest shot and not so great
of<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.079> shot<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:06.980> if<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:08.000> isn't<00:04:08.329> something

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
of a shot so if this isn't something

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.240 
of a shot so if this isn't something
that<00:04:08.810> you've<00:04:08.930> done<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.739> own<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.010> big

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
that you've done and you own a big

that you've done and you own a big
expensive<00:04:10.819> lens<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.420> can<00:04:12.049> highly<00:04:12.470> recommend

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
expensive lens I can highly recommend

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.849 
expensive lens I can highly recommend
the<00:04:13.579> Spyder<00:04:13.910> lens<00:04:14.239> cow<00:04:14.569> as<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.930> good<00:04:15.260> tool<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.709> do

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
the Spyder lens cow as a good tool to do

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.759 
the Spyder lens cow as a good tool to do
this<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.250> really<00:04:16.729> think<00:04:16.910> it's<00:04:17.030> worthwhile

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
this I really think it's worthwhile

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.479 
this I really think it's worthwhile
especially<00:04:18.769> considering<00:04:19.130> all<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> money

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
especially considering all the money

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.920 
especially considering all the money
spent<00:04:19.700> on<00:04:19.970> lenses<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:20.570> camera<00:04:20.900> equipment

spent on lenses and camera equipment
it's<00:04:21.829> important<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.220> remember<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.550> while

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970

it's important to remember that while
your<00:04:23.180> current<00:04:23.450> lens<00:04:23.600> might<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:24.100> functioning

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
your current lens might be functioning

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.490 
your current lens might be functioning
good<00:04:25.310> when<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.210> get<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.570> new<00:04:26.840> camera<00:04:27.080> you're

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
good when you get a new camera you're

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.990 
good when you get a new camera you're
gonna<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.889> redo<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.310> process<00:04:28.700> because

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
gonna have to redo this process because

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
gonna have to redo this process because
the<00:04:29.210> lens<00:04:29.419> now<00:04:29.660> has<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.960> talk<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:30.380> another

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
the lens now has to talk with another

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.980 
the lens now has to talk with another
different<00:04:31.440> piece<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.590> electronics<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.450> hope

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
different piece of electronics so I hope

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.840 
different piece of electronics so I hope
