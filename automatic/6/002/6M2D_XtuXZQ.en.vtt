myvideo<00:00:23.179> apart<00:00:23.539> from<00:00:23.659> others<00:00:23.900> in<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.079> web<00:00:24.320> is

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
myvideo apart from others in the web is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.989 
myvideo apart from others in the web is
the<00:00:24.679> fact<00:00:24.890> that<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.070> have<00:00:25.220> 10<00:00:25.669> years<00:00:25.880> experience

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:25.999 
the fact that I have 10 years experience

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.509 
the fact that I have 10 years experience
I'm<00:00:26.749> checking<00:00:26.960> these<00:00:27.140> day<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.589> day<00:00:27.769> out<00:00:27.800> doing

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
I'm checking these day and day out doing

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.950 
I'm checking these day and day out doing
multi-point<00:00:29.029> inspection<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.659> stuff<00:00:29.810> like

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
multi-point inspection and stuff like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.720 
multi-point inspection and stuff like
that<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:30.409> really<00:00:30.439> honed<00:00:30.829> in<00:00:31.009> my<00:00:31.099> skills<00:00:31.460> as

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
that so I really honed in my skills as

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.000 
that so I really honed in my skills as
what<00:00:32.390> works<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.870> what<00:00:33.020> does<00:00:33.200> not<00:00:33.230> work<00:00:33.500> for

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
what works and what does not work for

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.370 
what works and what does not work for
getting<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.250> accurate<00:00:34.670> diagnosis<00:00:35.390> on<00:00:35.570> these<00:00:35.780> a

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
getting to accurate diagnosis on these a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.290 
getting to accurate diagnosis on these a
lot<00:00:36.740> of<00:00:36.860> times<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.400> one<00:00:37.670> component<00:00:38.090> that

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
lot of times the one component that

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.570 
lot of times the one component that
you're<00:00:38.420> really<00:00:38.690> worn<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.380> have<00:00:39.800> feel<00:00:40.130> like

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
you're really worn and have feel like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.920 
you're really worn and have feel like
another<00:00:40.940> component<00:00:41.390> where<00:00:41.570> you're<00:00:41.690> doing<00:00:41.840> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
another component where you're doing the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.330 
another component where you're doing the
testing<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:42.500> there<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:42.830> actually<00:00:43.160> how<00:00:43.280> to

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
testing on there so actually how to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.490 
testing on there so actually how to
differentiate<00:00:44.150> between<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:45.080> two<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.350> them

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
differentiate between the two of them

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.590 
differentiate between the two of them
there<00:00:45.710> now<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.310> best<00:00:46.550> way<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.760> test<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:47.360> loose

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
there now the best way to test for loose

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300 
there now the best way to test for loose
steering<00:00:47.870> components<00:00:48.530> on<00:00:48.590> these<00:00:48.710> vehicles<00:00:48.890> is

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
steering components on these vehicles is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.790 
steering components on these vehicles is
to<00:00:49.730> Jack<00:00:50.000> them<00:00:50.180> up<00:00:50.300> obviously<00:00:50.960> get<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.620> weight

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
to Jack them up obviously get the weight

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.930 
to Jack them up obviously get the weight
off<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.130> them<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.580> move<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.790> wheel

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
off of them so you can move the wheel

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.610 
off of them so you can move the wheel
freely<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:53.990> we're<00:00:54.110> going<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.260> grab<00:00:54.470> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
freely and then we're going to grab the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.170 
freely and then we're going to grab the
wheel<00:00:54.770> at<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> 3<00:00:55.190> o'clock<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.910> 9<00:00:56.090> o'clock

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
wheel at the 3 o'clock and the 9 o'clock

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.240 
wheel at the 3 o'clock and the 9 o'clock
position<00:00:56.810> on<00:00:56.930> here<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.350> we're<00:00:57.800> going<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.010> push

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
position on here and we're going to push

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.370 
position on here and we're going to push
and<00:00:58.490> pull<00:00:58.670> push<00:00:59.060> and<00:00:59.090> pull<00:00:59.450> push<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.780> pull<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
and pull push and pull push and pull and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.380 
and pull push and pull push and pull and
it<00:01:00.710> looks<00:01:00.920> something<00:01:01.130> like<00:01:01.220> this<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.910> you

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
it looks something like this and you

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.319 
it looks something like this and you
should<00:01:02.600> be<00:01:02.690> able<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.050> when<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.860> do<00:01:04.070> this<00:01:04.329> you

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
should be able you when you do this you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.280 
should be able you when you do this you
shouldn't<00:01:05.630> feel<00:01:05.780> anything

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
shouldn't feel anything

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.620 
shouldn't feel anything
I<00:01:06.439> mean<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:06.979> may<00:01:07.070> feel<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.119> sidewall<00:01:08.600> of

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
I mean you may feel that the sidewall of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.930 
I mean you may feel that the sidewall of
the<00:01:08.870> tire<00:01:09.200> flexing<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.800> little<00:01:10.070> bit<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.460> very

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
the tire flexing a little bit a very

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.850 
the tire flexing a little bit a very
small<00:01:11.240> amount<00:01:11.360> but<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.810> should<00:01:12.050> feel<00:01:12.260> zero

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
small amount but you should feel zero

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.590 
small amount but you should feel zero
movement<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.000> amount<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.240> strength<00:01:14.540> you

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
movement with the amount of strength you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.910 
movement with the amount of strength you
have<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:14.900> your<00:01:14.960> arms<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.409> should<00:01:15.560> not<00:01:15.710> be<00:01:15.830> able

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
have in your arms you should not be able

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.410 
have in your arms you should not be able
to<00:01:15.980> flex<00:01:16.280> any<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.760> steering<00:01:17.120> or

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
to flex any of the steering or

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.020 
to flex any of the steering or
suspension<00:01:18.020> components<00:01:18.740> now<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.550> one<00:01:19.790> I'll

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
suspension components now this one I'll

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.969 
suspension components now this one I'll
just<00:01:20.450> go<00:01:20.930> down<00:01:21.110> here<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.350> little<00:01:21.560> further<00:01:21.770> so

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
just go down here a little further so

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.810 
just go down here a little further so
you<00:01:22.070> can<00:01:22.190> see

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.510 

that's<00:01:26.420> very<00:01:26.660> light<00:01:26.960> pressure<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:28.370> can

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's very light pressure and you can

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.230 
that's very light pressure and you can
see<00:01:28.760> this<00:01:28.940> is<00:01:29.180> flopping<00:01:29.780> big<00:01:30.650> time<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:32.150> we

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
see this is flopping big time so we

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.790 
see this is flopping big time so we
definitely<00:01:32.450> have<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.810> loose<00:01:33.080> inner<00:01:33.470> or<00:01:33.770> outer

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
definitely have a loose inner or outer

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800 
definitely have a loose inner or outer
tie<00:01:34.280> rod<00:01:34.310> end<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.970> I'll<00:01:35.360> show<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.630> how<00:01:35.780> to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
tie rod end and I'll show you how to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.200 
tie rod end and I'll show you how to
differentiate<00:01:36.350> between<00:01:36.950> those<00:01:37.400> two<00:01:37.700> also

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
differentiate between those two also

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.020 
differentiate between those two also
going<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.470> backside<00:01:40.040> here<00:01:40.340> let's<00:01:40.910> give

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
going on the backside here let's give

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.340 
going on the backside here let's give
you<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.180> side<00:01:41.510> shot<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.460> front<00:01:43.460> shot<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
you a side shot here front shot of the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.160 
you a side shot here front shot of the
wheel<00:01:45.620> on<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.190> okay<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.820> we'll<00:01:47.720> do<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.930> same

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
wheel on here okay and we'll do the same

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.110 
wheel on here okay and we'll do the same
test<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.070> can<00:01:49.220> really<00:01:49.430> see<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:49.850> from<00:01:49.940> over

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
test and you can really see it from over

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.450 
test and you can really see it from over
here<00:01:53.650> again<00:01:54.650> three<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.190> nine<00:01:55.340> o'clock

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
here again three and nine o'clock

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.770 
here again three and nine o'clock
position<00:01:56.170> back<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.410> forth<00:01:57.590> back<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.830> forth<00:01:58.070> I

position back and forth back and forth I

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.090 
position back and forth back and forth I
should<00:01:59.780> not<00:01:59.930> be<00:01:59.960> able<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.229> do<00:02:00.350> anything<00:02:00.740> with

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
should not be able to do anything with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.960 
should not be able to do anything with
this<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:03.410> this<00:02:03.530> one's<00:02:03.740> pretty<00:02:03.979> bad<00:02:04.100> okay<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
this so this one's pretty bad okay so

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.460 
this so this one's pretty bad okay so
here<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.240> go<00:02:05.390> what<00:02:05.570> you're<00:02:05.660> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.900> look<00:02:06.110> for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
here we go what you're going to look for

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.389 
here we go what you're going to look for
is<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.770> popping<00:02:07.670> and/or<00:02:08.540> looseness<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
is a popping and/or looseness of the

outer<00:02:10.580> tie<00:02:10.910> rod<00:02:10.940> end<00:02:11.270> here<00:02:11.510> with<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
outer tie rod end here with a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.560 
outer tie rod end here with a
ball-and-socket<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.800> at<00:02:12.950> or<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.360> inner

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
ball-and-socket is at or on the inner

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720 
ball-and-socket is at or on the inner
side<00:02:14.959> here<00:02:15.260> you'll<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:15.680> you'll<00:02:15.890> see<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.250> also

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
side here you'll see you'll see it also

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330 
side here you'll see you'll see it also
most<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.959> time<00:02:18.170> it's<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.770> outer<00:02:18.950> here

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
most of the time it's on the outer here

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.790 
most of the time it's on the outer here
the<00:02:19.489> outer<00:02:19.640> tie<00:02:19.880> rod<00:02:19.940> ends<00:02:20.300> most<00:02:20.630> common<00:02:21.170> now

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the outer tie rod ends most common now

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.500 
the outer tie rod ends most common now
if<00:02:22.040> you're<00:02:22.190> getting<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.670> looseness<00:02:22.940> feeling

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
if you're getting this looseness feeling

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.240 
if you're getting this looseness feeling
the<00:02:23.690> popping<00:02:24.110> feeling<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:24.950> you're<00:02:25.040> doing

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the popping feeling when you're doing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.320 
the popping feeling when you're doing
the<00:02:25.310> test<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.820> outside<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.239> wheel

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the test and the outside of the wheel

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.570 
the test and the outside of the wheel
here<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:27.290> seems<00:02:27.560> solid<00:02:27.860> right<00:02:28.250> everything

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
here this seems solid right everything

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.729 
here this seems solid right everything
seems<00:02:28.820> solid<00:02:29.270> which<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.320> look<00:02:30.530> over

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
seems solid which what I do is look over

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.440 
seems solid which what I do is look over
here<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.459> see<00:02:31.670> if<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.880> popping<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
here and see if the popping and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.090 
here and see if the popping and
looseness<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.140> inner<00:02:33.290> tie<00:02:33.530> rod<00:02:33.590> inside

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
looseness is on the inner tie rod inside

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.670 
looseness is on the inner tie rod inside
so<00:02:34.400> I'll<00:02:35.030> give<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> look-see<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.470> how

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
so I'll give you a look-see and see how

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.470 
so I'll give you a look-see and see how
this<00:02:36.890> thing<00:02:37.220> looks<00:02:37.250> when<00:02:37.820> it's<00:02:37.970> really<00:02:38.150> loose

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
this thing looks when it's really loose

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.650 
this thing looks when it's really loose
and<00:02:38.870> coming<00:02:39.680> apart<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.489> again<00:02:41.420> we're

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and coming apart like this again we're

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.680 
and coming apart like this again we're
grabbing<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.440> wheel<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.150> nine<00:02:44.330> o'clock

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
grabbing the wheel at the nine o'clock

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.720 
grabbing the wheel at the nine o'clock
and<00:02:44.870> 3<00:02:45.049> o'clock<00:02:45.110> position<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.130> pushing<00:02:46.610> and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
and 3 o'clock position and pushing and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.759 
and 3 o'clock position and pushing and
pulling<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.420> see<00:02:50.690> how<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.900> wheel<00:02:51.230> and

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
pulling and you see how the wheel and

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.850 
pulling and you see how the wheel and
the<00:02:52.010> rotor<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.880> everything<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.330> coming<00:02:53.860> along

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the rotor and everything is coming along

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.400 
the rotor and everything is coming along
as<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.400> push<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.910> pull<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> only<00:02:57.140> thing

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
as I push and pull but the only thing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.370 
as I push and pull but the only thing
that's<00:02:57.470> giving<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.459> popping<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.450> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
that's giving out and popping is the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.170 
that's giving out and popping is the
outer<00:03:00.560> tie<00:03:00.920> rod<00:03:00.980> end<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:01.549> very<00:03:01.880> very

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
outer tie rod end and it's very very

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.789 
outer tie rod end and it's very very
obvious<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:02.989> want<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:03.290> behind<00:03:03.590> there

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
obvious but you want to go behind there

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.270 
obvious but you want to go behind there
and<00:03:03.950> look<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.720> make<00:03:05.750> sure<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.890> not<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
and look and make sure it's not like the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.320 
and look and make sure it's not like the
wheel<00:03:07.810> hub<00:03:08.810> bearing<00:03:09.350> or<00:03:09.980> even<00:03:10.730> I've<00:03:10.820> seen<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
wheel hub bearing or even I've seen the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.380 
wheel hub bearing or even I've seen the
really<00:03:11.870> bad<00:03:12.019> lower<00:03:12.320> ball<00:03:12.650> joints<00:03:13.180> feel<00:03:14.180> like

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
really bad lower ball joints feel like

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.940 
really bad lower ball joints feel like
it's<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.660> outer<00:03:14.810> tie<00:03:15.080> rod<00:03:15.140> end<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:15.560> go<00:03:15.650> behind

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
it's the outer tie rod end so go behind

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's the outer tie rod end so go behind
there<00:03:16.160> let<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.850> are<00:03:17.030> now<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.600> give<00:03:18.140> a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
there let you are now and give a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.080 
there let you are now and give a
look-see<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:19.130> really<00:03:19.370> verify<00:03:19.880> you're

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
look-see to really verify you're

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.020 
look-see to really verify you're
replacing<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:21.080> part

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
replacing the right part

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.180 
replacing the right part
now<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> way<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.330> test<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.989> lower<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.040> upper

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
now the way you test the lower and upper

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.830 
now the way you test the lower and upper
ball<00:03:25.549> joints<00:03:25.910> on<00:03:26.030> here<00:03:26.239> is<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.390> same<00:03:26.630> way<00:03:26.780> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
ball joints on here is the same way you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.410 
ball joints on here is the same way you
push<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.350> pull<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:28.070> now<00:03:28.190> let's<00:03:28.400> at<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.790> 12

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
push and pull but now let's at the 12

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.420 
push and pull but now let's at the 12
o'clock<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.930> assist<00:03:30.440> o'clock<00:03:30.769> position<00:03:31.280> on

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
o'clock and assist o'clock position on

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.640 
o'clock and assist o'clock position on
here<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> procedure<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> same<00:03:33.140> and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
here but the procedure is the same and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.560 
here but the procedure is the same and
you<00:03:34.100> can<00:03:34.220> see<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> sidewall<00:03:34.910> maybe<00:03:35.209> moving<00:03:35.480> a

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
you can see a sidewall maybe moving a

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.270 
you can see a sidewall maybe moving a
little<00:03:35.750> bit

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
little bit

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.790 
little bit
but<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:36.790> definitely<00:03:37.080> nothing<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
but it's definitely nothing in the the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.760 
but it's definitely nothing in the the
suspension<00:03:39.460> here<00:03:39.700> though<00:03:40.120> wheel<00:03:40.540> hub<00:03:40.810> or<00:03:41.290> ball

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
suspension here though wheel hub or ball

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.490 
suspension here though wheel hub or ball
joints<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.460> moving<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.270> all<00:03:43.480> that's<00:03:44.230> another

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
joints is moving at all that's another

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.440 
joints is moving at all that's another
thing<00:03:44.740> like<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.130> said<00:03:45.370> go<00:03:45.520> on<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.670> backside<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
thing like I said go on the backside and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.870 
thing like I said go on the backside and
check<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.380> verify<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.950> actually<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.520> a<00:03:48.550> ball

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
check and verify it actually is a ball

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.180 
check and verify it actually is a ball
joint<00:03:49.150> upper<00:03:49.630> or<00:03:49.780> lower<00:03:50.020> that's<00:03:50.620> popping<00:03:51.040> as

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
joint upper or lower that's popping as

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.390 
joint upper or lower that's popping as
you<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.900> that's<00:03:53.470> not<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.950> wheel<00:03:54.160> hub

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you do that and that's not the wheel hub

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.160 
you do that and that's not the wheel hub
on<00:03:54.520> here<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> lot<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.940> times<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.480> wheel<00:03:55.660> hub<00:03:55.959> is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
on here a lot of times the wheel hub is

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.010 
on here a lot of times the wheel hub is
the<00:03:57.100> faulty<00:03:57.459> component<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.150> people<00:03:58.810> change

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
the faulty component and people change

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.660 
the faulty component and people change
ball<00:03:59.230> joints<00:03:59.560> off<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.890> doing<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.190> test<00:04:00.520> on

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
ball joints off and doing this test on

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.670 
ball joints off and doing this test on
here<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:00.970> go<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.600> back<00:04:01.750> side<00:04:01.959> do<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.440> again

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
here so go to the back side do it again

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.760 
here so go to the back side do it again
and<00:04:02.890> really<00:04:03.490> verify<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.959> lower<00:04:05.500> or

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
and really verify that it is a lower or

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.410 
and really verify that it is a lower or
upper<00:04:06.190> ball<00:04:06.580> joint<00:04:06.610> actually<00:04:07.150> actually

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
upper ball joint actually actually

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.600 
upper ball joint actually actually
popping<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.080> at<00:04:08.200> socket<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.890> it's<00:04:09.310> not<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
popping in at socket and it's not the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.670 
popping in at socket and it's not the
hub<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:09.880> bearing<00:04:10.300> okay<00:04:11.080> so<00:04:11.140> that<00:04:11.380> wasn't<00:04:11.500> so

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
hub and bearing okay so that wasn't so

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.060 
hub and bearing okay so that wasn't so
bad

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
bad

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.920 
bad
this<00:04:12.430> one<00:04:12.640> had<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:12.850> pretty<00:04:13.239> good<00:04:13.390> example<00:04:13.480> of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
this one had a pretty good example of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.110 
this one had a pretty good example of
how<00:04:14.020> an<00:04:14.530> outer<00:04:14.770> tie<00:04:15.040> rod<00:04:15.070> end<00:04:15.430> looks<00:04:15.700> on<00:04:15.910> there

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
how an outer tie rod end looks on there

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.199 
how an outer tie rod end looks on there
it<00:04:16.419> was<00:04:16.510> pretty<00:04:16.750> worn<00:04:17.049> on<00:04:17.260> there<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> just<00:04:19.060> keep

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
it was pretty worn on there so just keep

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.479 
it was pretty worn on there so just keep
in<00:04:19.329> mind<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.140> one<00:04:20.650> loose<00:04:20.890> component

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
in mind that the one loose component

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.400 
in mind that the one loose component
like<00:04:21.609> especially<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.150> hub<00:04:22.270> bearings<00:04:22.780> they

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
like especially the hub bearings they

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.560 
like especially the hub bearings they
can<00:04:23.770> make<00:04:24.010> everything<00:04:24.790> else<00:04:25.000> seem<00:04:25.330> loose

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
can make everything else seem loose

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.260 
can make everything else seem loose
especially<00:04:25.870> outer<00:04:26.530> tie<00:04:26.860> rod<00:04:26.890> ends<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.550> upper

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
especially outer tie rod ends and upper

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.450 
especially outer tie rod ends and upper
and<00:04:28.600> lower<00:04:28.750> ball<00:04:29.020> joints<00:04:29.410> because<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.830> hub

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
and lower ball joints because the hub

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.980 
and lower ball joints because the hub
bearing<00:04:30.880> when<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.090> coming<00:04:31.360> apart<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.840> much

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
bearing when is coming apart so much

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.500 
bearing when is coming apart so much
like<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:32.410> everything<00:04:33.310> else<00:04:33.700> just<00:04:34.090> gives

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
like that everything else just gives

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.690 
like that everything else just gives
whenever<00:04:35.169> you're<00:04:35.350> doing<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.770> other<00:04:35.919> test<00:04:36.430> on

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
whenever you're doing the other test on

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.090 
whenever you're doing the other test on
it<00:04:36.730> if<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.090> have<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.630> realize<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.860> most

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
it if you have to realize so the most

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.920 
it if you have to realize so the most
important<00:04:39.700> part<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.390> take<00:04:40.690> away

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
important part that you can take away

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.960 
important part that you can take away
from<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.169> is<00:04:41.620> they<00:04:42.160> look<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.729> backside

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
from this is they look on the backside

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.230 
from this is they look on the backside
there<00:04:43.479> as<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:44.530> look<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.010> see<00:04:45.250> exactly<00:04:45.700> what's

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
there as in look and see exactly what's

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.390 
there as in look and see exactly what's
going<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.690> while<00:04:47.229> someone's<00:04:47.740> pulling<00:04:48.070> and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
going on while someone's pulling and

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.290 
going on while someone's pulling and
tugging<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.570> tire<00:04:49.780> on<00:04:50.080> there
