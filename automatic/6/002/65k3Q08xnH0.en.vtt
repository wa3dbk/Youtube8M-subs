different types of alarms on this one

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
different types of alarms on this one
that<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:53.310> were<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> show<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> great

this<00:02:11.100> one<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> carbon<00:02:12.120> monoxide<00:02:12.210> alarm

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
this one is a carbon monoxide alarm

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900 
this one is a carbon monoxide alarm
that's<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.410> actually<00:02:13.640> tell<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
that's going to actually tell you the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.600 
that's going to actually tell you the
peak<00:02:15.390> level<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> highest<00:02:17.220> amount<00:02:17.520> of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
peak level so the highest amount of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.340 
peak level so the highest amount of
carbon<00:02:17.910> monoxide<00:02:17.940> did<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.600> read<00:02:18.810> since<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
carbon monoxide did it read since the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.710 
carbon monoxide did it read since the
last<00:02:19.560> time<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.010> tested<00:02:20.460> okay<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.420> great

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
last time you tested okay and it's great

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.570 
last time you tested okay and it's great
because<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.170> gives<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.530> digital<00:02:22.980> readout<00:02:23.310> right

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
because it gives a digital readout right

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.400 
because it gives a digital readout right
up<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> front<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.020> Florida

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
up there on the front and in Florida

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710 
up there on the front and in Florida
people<00:02:25.800> often<00:02:26.250> think<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.580> think<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:26.910> oh<00:02:27.180> we

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
people often think I think that oh we

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.060 
people often think I think that oh we
don't<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.020> too<00:02:28.170> cold<00:02:28.380> weather<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> we're

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
don't have too cold weather and we're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.250 
don't have too cold weather and we're
not<00:02:29.220> using<00:02:29.600> furnaces<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.750> thawing<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.170> you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
not using furnaces and thawing but you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
not using furnaces and thawing but you
absolutely<00:02:31.950> need<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> carbon<00:02:32.610> monoxide<00:02:32.700> alarm

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
absolutely need a carbon monoxide alarm

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
absolutely need a carbon monoxide alarm
another<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.590> people<00:02:34.920> don't

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
another thing is is that people don't

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.730 
another thing is is that people don't
you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.790> they'll<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> park<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> car

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
you know they'll go in and park the car

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.320 
you know they'll go in and park the car
in<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> garage<00:02:38.040> or<00:02:38.490> maybe<00:02:38.700> leave<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> car

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
in the garage or maybe leave the car

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.880 
in the garage or maybe leave the car
running<00:02:39.500> accidentally<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> they're<00:02:40.740> not

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
running accidentally and they're not

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.250 
running accidentally and they're not
thinking<00:02:41.220> about<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.140> an

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
thinking about it and if you have an

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.900 
thinking about it and if you have an
attached<00:02:43.590> garage<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.430> come<00:02:44.610> into<00:02:44.790> your

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
attached garage it can come into your

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.400 
attached garage it can come into your
home<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.510> was<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.930> say<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.260> all

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
home I was going to say that all

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.570 
home I was going to say that all
especially<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.890> townhouses<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.430> condos

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
especially the townhouses and condos

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
especially the townhouses and condos
they're<00:02:48.090> all<00:02:48.270> right<00:02:48.690> next<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.080> each<00:02:49.200> other<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
they're all right next to each other and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.070 
they're all right next to each other and
your<00:02:49.980> neighbors<00:02:50.370> homes<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.450> mean<00:02:51.810> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
your neighbors homes and so I mean you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.260 
your neighbors homes and so I mean you
know<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.220> tragedy<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> hear

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
know this it's a tragedy but you hear

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.930 
know this it's a tragedy but you hear
about<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:55.470> happening<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.400> killing<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
about that happening and it killing the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.400 
about that happening and it killing the
neighbors<00:02:57.330> too<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.320> be

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
neighbors too and so you have to be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.140 
neighbors too and so you have to be
careful<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.770> yourself<00:02:58.920> first<00:02:59.490> be<00:02:59.700> mindful<00:03:00.000> of

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
careful of yourself first be mindful of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.520 
careful of yourself first be mindful of
your<00:03:00.330> neighbors<00:03:00.630> pants<00:03:00.840> where<00:03:01.050> do<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.260> place

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
your neighbors pants where do we place

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.080 
your neighbors pants where do we place
these<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.920> our<00:03:01.980> home<00:03:02.190> should<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:02.490> be<00:03:02.550> also<00:03:02.790> at

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
these in our home should they be also at

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.490 
these in our home should they be also at
the<00:03:03.209> top<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.510> our<00:03:03.600> ceiling<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the top in our ceiling just like the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.560 
the top in our ceiling just like the
other<00:03:05.040> smoke<00:03:05.400> detectors<00:03:05.910> well<00:03:06.209> carbon

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
other smoke detectors well carbon

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420 
other smoke detectors well carbon
monoxide<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.230> roughly<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.770> same<00:03:08.040> molecular

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
monoxide is roughly the same molecular

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
monoxide is roughly the same molecular
weight<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.720> pretty<00:03:09.930> much<00:03:10.020> go

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
weight is there so it can pretty much go

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.900 
weight is there so it can pretty much go
anywhere<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.980> your<00:03:11.010> home<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.670> have<00:03:11.880> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
anywhere in your home but if you have a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
anywhere in your home but if you have a
combination<00:03:12.330> alarm<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> one<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.530> we

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
combination alarm like the one that we

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.740 
combination alarm like the one that we
showed<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.070> earlier<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.670> has<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.630> on

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
showed you earlier that has to go up on

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
showed you earlier that has to go up on
the<00:03:15.870> ceiling<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.709> has<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.070> smoke

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the ceiling because it has the smoke

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.580 
the ceiling because it has the smoke
alarm<00:03:17.700> component<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> smoke<00:03:19.380> arises

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
alarm component in it and smoke arises

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.229 
alarm component in it and smoke arises
smoke<00:03:19.860> arises<00:03:20.190> sometimes<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.030> honest<00:03:21.180> I

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
smoke arises sometimes to be honest I

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
smoke arises sometimes to be honest I
think<00:03:21.390> rice<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> really<00:03:22.110> cool<00:03:22.260> feature<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
think rice is a really cool feature that

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.620 
think rice is a really cool feature that
it<00:03:22.830> talks<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.280> tonight<00:03:23.489> now<00:03:24.030> why<00:03:24.239> do<00:03:24.300> we<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
it talks it tonight now why do we have a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.750 
it talks it tonight now why do we have a
remote<00:03:24.959> control<00:03:25.019> here<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:25.830> because<00:03:26.370> this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
remote control here well because this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.050 
remote control here well because this
alarm<00:03:27.150> has<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.320> remote<00:03:28.890> control<00:03:29.060> capability

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
alarm has a remote control capability

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.150 
alarm has a remote control capability
you<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.330> people<00:03:31.019> don't<00:03:31.739> want<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.040> be

now<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.650> other<00:04:19.919> important<00:04:20.430> thing<00:04:20.580> about<00:04:20.669> this

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
now the other important thing about this

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.870 
now the other important thing about this
alarm<00:04:21.209> that's<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:21.690> cool<00:04:22.020> is<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.650> it

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
alarm that's so cool is that it

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.330 
alarm that's so cool is that it
both<00:04:23.260> photoelectric<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.470> ionization

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
both photoelectric and ionization

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.210 
both photoelectric and ionization
technology<00:04:25.930> okay<00:04:26.930> why<00:04:27.380> that's<00:04:27.650> important

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
technology okay why that's important

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.830 
technology okay why that's important
because<00:04:28.370> there<00:04:28.910> are<00:04:29.030> two<00:04:29.180> different<00:04:29.480> types<00:04:29.660> of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
because there are two different types of

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.890 
because there are two different types of
fires<00:04:30.110> one<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.430> slow<00:04:31.970> smoldering<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
fires one is slow smoldering and the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.050 
fires one is slow smoldering and the
other<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.290> fast<00:04:33.620> flaming<00:04:34.250> okay<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.880> two

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
other is fast flaming okay the two

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.150 
other is fast flaming okay the two
different<00:04:35.390> type<00:04:35.600> types<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.230> technology<00:04:37.010> it's

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
different type types of technology it's

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.850 
different type types of technology it's
two<00:04:37.340> different<00:04:37.460> sensors<00:04:38.120> one<00:04:38.860> generally

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
two different sensors one generally

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.700 
two different sensors one generally
reacts<00:04:40.550> quicker<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.570> slow<00:04:41.840> smoldering<00:04:42.470> fires

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
reacts quicker to slow smoldering fires

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.040 
reacts quicker to slow smoldering fires
than<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.100> other<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.640> fast<00:04:43.910> blaming<00:04:44.570> okay<00:04:44.900> so

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
than the other to fast blaming okay so

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.650 
than the other to fast blaming okay so
you<00:04:45.110> want<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.680> combination<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.450> two

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
you want a combination of the two

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.150 
you want a combination of the two
technologies<00:04:48.350> in<00:04:48.560> your<00:04:48.680> home<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.130> can

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
technologies in your home and you can

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040 
technologies in your home and you can
get<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.670> one<00:04:49.850> alarm<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.840> that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
get it and one alarm with this and that

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.660 
get it and one alarm with this and that

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
both of the sensors of the kind of fire

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.260 
both of the sensors of the kind of fire
does<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.280> also<00:04:55.520> talk<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.060> tell<00:04:56.210> you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
does it also talk to you and tell you

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.240 
does it also talk to you and tell you
what<00:04:56.480> room<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.170> one<00:04:57.410> does<00:04:57.560> not<00:04:57.590> okay

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
what room it is this one does not okay

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.770
