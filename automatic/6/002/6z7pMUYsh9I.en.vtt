berkey water filter I went with the
Royal<00:00:09.840> Berkey<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.530> believe<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> holds<00:00:11.400> three

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
Royal Berkey I believe it holds three

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.089 
Royal Berkey I believe it holds three
gallons<00:00:12.269> when<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> box<00:00:13.830> it

gallons when you get it in the box it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.640 
gallons when you get it in the box it
comes<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.429> several<00:00:14.670> pieces<00:00:15.470> basically<00:00:16.470> all

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
comes in several pieces basically all

running<00:00:21.390> there's<00:00:22.140> three<00:00:22.350> main<00:00:23.100> components<00:00:23.550> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
running there's three main components to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820 
running there's three main components to
put<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.510> bar<00:00:24.660> key<00:00:24.779> together<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
put in your bar key together first you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.200 
put in your bar key together first you
want<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> clean<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.250> I've<00:00:26.640> already<00:00:26.910> done<00:00:27.060> that

ahead of time so that's all taken care
of<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.490> give<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> quick<00:00:29.910> scrub<00:00:30.179> rinse<00:00:30.570> it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
of just give it a quick scrub rinse it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
of just give it a quick scrub rinse it
out<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> make<00:00:31.109> sure<00:00:31.140> there's<00:00:31.380> no<00:00:31.500> soap<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.890> it

out and make sure there's no soap in it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
out and make sure there's no soap in it
the<00:00:32.759> second<00:00:33.090> step<00:00:33.239> will<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.630> want<00:00:33.809> to

the second step will be you want to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.900 
the second step will be you want to
prime<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.350> filters<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> third

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
prime your filters and then the third

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
prime your filters and then the third
step<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> assemble<00:00:37.230> your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
step will be you want to assemble your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.040 
step will be you want to assemble your
whole<00:00:37.500> unit<00:00:38.149> priming<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.180> filters<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
whole unit priming your filters is

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.130 
whole unit priming your filters is
pretty<00:00:40.290> easy<00:00:41.390> get<00:00:42.390> these<00:00:42.540> nice<00:00:42.719> carbon

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
slowly it can pop off and make a big

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.890 
slowly it can pop off and make a big
mess<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.520> careful<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.270> we're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
mess here if you're not careful so we're

just going to get a little wet here and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.039 
just going to get a little wet here and
what<00:01:17.970> we're<00:01:18.090> doing<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.330> flushing<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:18.960> the

what we're doing is flushing it from the
inside<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.200> soon<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> gets<00:01:22.680> going

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.410 

water<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.549> start<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> come<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
water will start to come out of the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
water will start to come out of the
sides<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> pores<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> filter<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sides and the pores of the filter and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
sides and the pores of the filter and
you<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.320> sometimes<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> water

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you want to do this sometimes the water

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.399 
you want to do this sometimes the water
tension<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.250> too<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.079> gravity<00:01:34.079> alone

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
tension is too much and gravity alone

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.359 
tension is too much and gravity alone
won't<00:01:34.770> allow<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:36.140> pull<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> waterproof<00:01:37.770> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
won't allow it to pull the waterproof so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
won't allow it to pull the waterproof so
you're<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> create<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.210> siphon<00:01:39.630> here

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're kind of create that siphon here

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.179 
you're kind of create that siphon here
kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> getting<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
kind of getting it going and what the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
kind of getting it going and what the
network<00:01:41.400> needs<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.270> flush<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.470> any

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
network needs to go and flush in any

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
network needs to go and flush in any
little<00:01:44.520> pieces<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.939> carbon<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> whatnot<00:01:45.630> out

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
little pieces of carbon and whatnot out

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.560 
little pieces of carbon and whatnot out
of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> filter<00:01:47.060> segments<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.180> turn<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> off

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
of the filter segments and turn it off

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
of the filter segments and turn it off
so<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.770> prime<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.280> did<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> other<00:01:50.670> one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so this one is prime I did the other one

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.149 
so this one is prime I did the other one
ahead<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> time<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.479> went

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
ahead of time so we went

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.859 
ahead of time so we went
through<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.460> twice<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:55.479> filters<00:01:56.479> are<00:01:56.600> crying

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
through this twice so filters are crying

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.450 
through this twice so filters are crying
all<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.499> way<00:01:57.560> I'd<00:01:57.649> love<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.859> do<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.039> assembly

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
all the way I'd love to do is assembly

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.559 
all the way I'd love to do is assembly
you<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.600> base<00:01:59.780> unit<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.789> you<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
you have a base unit and you have the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.440 
you have a base unit and you have the
top<00:02:02.780> unit<00:02:03.140> your<00:02:03.950> filters<00:02:04.399> will<00:02:04.670> sit<00:02:04.939> inside

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
top unit your filters will sit inside

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.440 
top unit your filters will sit inside
your<00:02:05.509> unit<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:07.189> top<00:02:07.399> piece<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.880> then<00:02:08.269> they'll

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
your unit the top piece and then they'll

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.650 
your unit the top piece and then they'll
filter<00:02:08.810> down<00:02:08.959> into<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.410> bottom<00:02:09.679> unit<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.660> we

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
filter down into the bottom unit and we

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.539 
filter down into the bottom unit and we
will<00:02:11.840> start<00:02:12.110> by<00:02:12.319> putting<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.920> lid<00:02:13.220> together

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
will start by putting the lid together

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.119 
will start by putting the lid together
that's<00:02:14.330> relatively<00:02:14.840> easy<00:02:14.930> there's<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.920> tiny

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
that's relatively easy there's a tiny

which look like this real simple do the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:56.210 
which look like this real simple do the
same<00:03:28.280> way<00:03:28.489> just<00:03:28.760> run<00:03:29.000> them<00:03:29.120> up<00:03:29.209> through<00:03:29.419> here

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.210 

okay<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:58.060> our<00:03:58.510> top<00:03:58.720> parts<00:03:58.960> complete<00:03:59.380> has<00:04:00.040> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
okay so our top parts complete has the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.850 
okay so our top parts complete has the
filters<00:04:00.640> installed<00:04:01.630> as<00:04:02.050> well<00:04:02.410> as<00:04:02.470> our<00:04:02.650> drain

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
filters installed as well as our drain

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.980 
filters installed as well as our drain
plug<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.400> we're<00:04:03.550> not<00:04:03.670> letting<00:04:04.210> unfiltered

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
plug so we're not letting unfiltered

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.560 
plug so we're not letting unfiltered
water<00:04:05.140> run<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> bottom<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:09.150> last<00:04:10.150> part<00:04:10.480> of

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
water run to the bottom and last part of

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.090 
water run to the bottom and last part of
the<00:04:10.630> operation<00:04:11.230> here<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.360> spigot<00:04:13.750> off<00:04:14.100> now

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
the operation here is the spigot off now

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.740 
the operation here is the spigot off now
you<00:04:15.160> want<00:04:15.490> to<00:04:15.520> put<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.790> white<00:04:16.030> gasket<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.660> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
you want to put the white gasket on the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.570 
you want to put the white gasket on the
outside<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.290> white<00:04:17.440> gasket<00:04:17.950> has<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.220> little

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
outside the white gasket has a little

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.270 
outside the white gasket has a little
bit<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.910> concave<00:04:19.180> or<00:04:19.570> convex<00:04:19.769> curve<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.010> I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
bit of a concave or convex curve to it I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.480 
bit of a concave or convex curve to it I
point<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.609> back<00:04:22.000> towards<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.930> hole<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:24.070> it's

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
point that back towards the hole so it's

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.210 
point that back towards the hole so it's
kind<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.700> angled<00:04:25.030> in<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.630> way<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.110> then<00:04:27.070> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
kind of angled in this way and then the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.040 
kind of angled in this way and then the
black<00:04:27.400> gasket<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.180> other<00:04:28.360> nut<00:04:28.630> go<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:28.960> the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
black gasket and the other nut go on the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.990 
black gasket and the other nut go on the
back<00:04:29.200> side<00:04:29.470> now<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.400> trick<00:04:30.640> I've<00:04:30.760> had<00:04:30.910> to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
back side now the trick I've had to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.160 
back side now the trick I've had to
doing<00:04:31.240> this<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.540> want<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.750> get<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.930> tight

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
doing this is you want to get it tight

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.480 
doing this is you want to get it tight
but<00:04:32.770> not<00:04:32.830> too<00:04:33.010> tight

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
but not too tight

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.490 
but not too tight
of<00:04:33.790> course<00:04:34.090> because<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.420> can<00:04:34.540> just<00:04:34.660> slip<00:04:34.930> all

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
of course because you can just slip all

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.800 
of course because you can just slip all
this<00:04:35.620> little<00:04:35.860> plastic<00:04:36.070> stuff<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.880> what<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.570> do

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
this little plastic stuff but what I do

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.010 
this little plastic stuff but what I do
is<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.930> start<00:04:38.050> with<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.470> spigot<00:04:38.680> upside<00:04:39.130> down<00:04:40.020> now

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
is I start with a spigot upside down now
