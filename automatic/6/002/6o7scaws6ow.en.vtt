00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.160
 how welcome are we again to test 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.160
 the new section on the blog Cook 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.900
 faithful and before you start with snacks 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 Israelis that I told you the other day here 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 let's try I teach you 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.640
 the rice tongues that I have called them 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.670
 me that they do not really call themselves this way 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.150
 they call it wireless cake in English 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.580
 I teach you a voucher that is called 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.560
 tongues of rice because some friends 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.820
 they call like that but well this is what 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.070
 use the other day and you can 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 find in stores in stores 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.220
 of Chinese products we are going with the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.220
 protas of today 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:58.000
 they are Israeli snacks here you have the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.440
 another went crazy looking for the names 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 because they buy them at the airport 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.670
 Israel already thinking of this section and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 good is everything in Hebrew as you see if 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 not the 50 the day there was no way to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.420
 find it on the internet at the end then I 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.149
 has helped google images and finally 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 I know what we're going to try today so 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.670
 less names 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.369
 this is called vigil to see 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.640
 beasley and xlii to see that I do not remember 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.259
 well beesley in theory comes the origin 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.979
 it's fried pasta and this is I think the 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.890
 barbecue and this is kind of 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.930
 crouton they put it in the soups but 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.360
 come on, you can eat 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.190
 you can eat it as well as snack and it's 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.940
 what we're going to do so we're going to 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.940
 try the both 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.850
 well more than enough let's go to it 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.430
 crispy and if you moss as you can see 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.840
 so they look like spirals like 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.840
 these pasta 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.300
 ah 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.870
 - has given what I expected 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.049
 remember those fried corn 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.330
 typical with a strong barbecue flavor 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:38.080
 This is a more mellow flavor 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.430
 to see what is good, I think 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:47.290
 there are many flavors of falafel pizza 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.140
 of paco onion these are the most 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.050
 classics I have also found the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.750
 ingredients on a website where they sell 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.850
 the product and it is 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.300
 basically it's wheat flour and the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.300
 truth is that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 without having a very original flavor are 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.060
 I can not stop eating like a vice 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.460
 we go with the next one to see me 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.740
 chew sure it's not nice 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.740
 we are with the croutons for the soup 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.610
 enough that if not to see how about 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.040
 these are mini squares of color 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.090
 yellow and here it says that it's basically 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.910
 flour 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.910
 and palm oil let's see how 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.560
 does not know much this either in 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.440
 actually yes it is stronger because 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 has spices have a thousand products 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.780
 but it does not taste like that very 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.760
 specific and this is how 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.069
 well, like bread taquitos 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.950
 tasteless a little bland 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.920
 I guess it makes the soup happy because it gives 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.480
 a crisp touch that is well the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.680
 history of the company that does everything 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.560
 what I see that is called posen is very 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.539
 curious because it was created to create 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.419
 food for a new country and that has 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.509
 it has a lot of grace in fact your product 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.919
 better known for they have two the tip tim 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.650
 that I have to do it is a recipe that 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.840
 it's a kind of mega couscous that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.490
 begins to be is reused already in the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.199
 haute cuisine because it has several 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.259
 properties between them that do not stick 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:44.080
 and cakes are left loose grains 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.020
 because they are like marbles are huge and 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.569
 then they have him 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.330
 the bam bam bam back is another of his 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.220
 products that is based on sesame that I 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.909
 program suit what I have eaten is also 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.199
 very vicious and they say that the word 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.199
 first words children learn 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:08.109
 Besides Mom and Dad is because bamba 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.989
 they are good and we have already seen the 

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:13.559
 croutons and elvis li and I stay 

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:13.559
 eating 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.099
 this vice of snack 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:27.449
 and next time we will try to forgive 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:30.089
 a japan wasabi pit cat you know 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.770
 if you liked it, you can give it to like and 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.770
