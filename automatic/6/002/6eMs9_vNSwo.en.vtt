00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 Look , everybody 's done exactly 25 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.639
 20 minutes that I made the recipe did not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.420
 I told you one hour but over time 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.010
 The heat is hot here in Sao Paulo 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 for in 20 and 25 minutes 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.689
 Look how it's already done. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 already producing co2 and the bottle is already 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.780
 with the violent pressure is already beginning 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.910
 to get enough pressure and just look there 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 producing co2 here makes up noise 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.719
 I know if you will listen, I'll open it. 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 The valve that I told you about. 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.379
 the valve that goes to the aquarium you 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.379
 See how it's going to boil over there. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 looking 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.870
 I'm going to close there 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 I closed it up now so now that gas that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.630
 is being produced there it will stay 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.910
 retained here in this bottle when it 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.140
 I opened I can get regular 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.830
 depending on the arrangement the way I 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.560
 I want 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.570
 and this second valve the team is only 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.080
 look in case of the following from inside 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.410
 aquarium is already in the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.420
 enough co2 you eliminate a little 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.270
 of this pressure all that is here because 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.670
 the first days to produce a lot of gas 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 then it may be that the bottle becomes a 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.920
 little again a little on the edge then 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.410
 for you to avoid the risk of 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.770
 something explosion you will leave 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.710
 this back a little open and regular 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.740
 the canopy gas inlet 2 inside 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.570
 of the aquarium in a way that does not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.580
 I'll show the fish to you in the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.740
 after practice but why is 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.619
 I saved you a little 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 pressure and do not throw all the co2 into 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.040
 Maybe you can play all this co2 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
 inside the court 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.050
 will have a change of ph very much 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.850
 radical and will make new clues so there 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 people can come is already producing 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.260
 damn co2 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 and it was very fast and I even opened it 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:36.709
 Here again, I like to see this. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:39.640
 scene is to open there right down to close 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.640
 do not lose too much gas 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.489
 I closed that everything in the limit that I am 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.370
 opening and closing would be for entry into the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.080
 aquarium can not have this input 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.640
 all of co2 on the block closed here 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.500
 forcing the bottle you eliminate a 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.780
 Little bit about this turn is a little bit 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.560
 only if the bottle has a lot 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.709
 rigid 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.840
 so come on, the final part of the video I 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.340
 I 'm going to finish here I 'm going to ride back here. 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.440
 the new code does not know how 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.050
 He remained unscathed with no one and now to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.720
 close the team just show you and 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.150
 how it got there in the installation of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.410
 the whole apparatus of heaven 2001 now 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.420
 I put here in the corner is 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.420
 running to 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.780
 and I put behind the court so they 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.340
 can see that in language they share co2 there 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.659
 there 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.920
 there to learn by pink dropping the 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.920
 co2 balls there 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.450
 this is a sufficient amount already 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.079
 that the aquarium which is 110 liters is 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:09.090
 so a good normal amount will have ph 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.829
 and is having enough contact with water 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:19.199
 and with that you have to use the stone 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:19.889
 porous and I can regulate the pressure 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.049
 also 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.030
 I do not know, I will not touch you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:30.060
 now because you can tune in 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:37.010
 The way I wanted it but the system is 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.010
 How are you guys going to ride here? 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.360
 here it works is the following here it is 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.900
 getting out of there 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.139
 and this one here in case of too much pressure 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.190
 vicente than in the bottle 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.330
 in the case of total 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.160
 The bottle is very stiff. 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.860
 [Music] 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.389
 you will pick up and open here and regulate the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.260
 entry here 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.760
 the aquarium understood that I might be 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.400
 coming back all this pressure here in 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.740
 inside the area and is doing 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.960
 drastic change and avant-garde escape 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.260
 normal emergency I always leave a 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.740
 little squeeze sow 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.039
 gas here so much strength in the bottle 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:35.300
 So, there you go. 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:35.300
 simple co2 practice 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.630
 of sun 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.730
 sometimes comments and is dangerous could have 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.169
 a country explode 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:50.180
 It might blow up the bottle like that. 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:54.590
 staff if you do not get the right recipe 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.180
 with the right amount making the recipe 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.090
 that I passed to you and you're not going 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.710
 have a problem in many sectors that 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.360
 find that they do not use this 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.650
 exhaust valve and also does not use is 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:12.440
 in this second bottle here is 600 ml 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.270
 already use direct from 2 liter to add 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.080
 The 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.120
 so I have here a system with 95% 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.580
 of security 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.650
 the other 5% stay in your client is 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.290
 your care, right? 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.690
 stay where you do it is still 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:34.820
 You 're right at the valve. 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:37.280
 escape and then I made here a system one 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.229
 a little safer than some who 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.260
 pass from the bottle of two 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.260
 liters 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.310
 That's it, I guess there's nothing left for 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.310
 behind that's it 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.680
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:58.430
 I ask you to give a 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.100
 like in the video I never ask for this but that 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.080
 video of a job so fucking so 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.020
 if you can be there and enjoy and 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.280
 sharing this video was useful for 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:14.270
 you comment leave your criticism 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.430
 leave your compliments and that's it folks 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.070
 good luck and I hope I have helped you 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.610
 Moment, give me a hug. 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.610
 went
