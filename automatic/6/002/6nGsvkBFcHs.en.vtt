00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a fuel pump this is a quick way to tell

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.980 
a fuel pump this is a quick way to tell
if<00:00:16.500> you've<00:00:16.650> got<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> bad<00:00:17.070> feeling<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.990> didn't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
if you've got a bad feeling you didn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.769 
if you've got a bad feeling you didn't
have<00:00:19.109> which<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:22.160> on<00:00:23.160> LOV<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.240> come<00:00:24.660> in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
have which is what I do on LOV I come in

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.439 
have which is what I do on LOV I come in
there<00:00:24.900> take<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> ECM<00:00:25.769> beef<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.279> out

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.920 

make<00:00:31.990> myself<00:00:32.230> just<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.739> jumper<00:00:33.100> wire<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.930> plug

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
make myself just a jumper wire I plug

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.710 
make myself just a jumper wire I plug
that<00:00:35.079> into<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.530> ECM<00:00:35.829> D<00:00:36.100> fuse<00:00:37.500> take<00:00:38.500> my<00:00:38.680> generic

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
that into the ECM D fuse take my generic

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.970 
that into the ECM D fuse take my generic
current<00:00:40.720> probe<00:00:41.040> set<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.309> 20<00:00:42.670> amps<00:00:43.860> loop<00:00:44.860> it

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
current probe set it on 20 amps loop it

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.960 
current probe set it on 20 amps loop it
around<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.340> wire<00:00:46.830> so<00:00:47.830> we<00:00:47.980> can<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.370> electrical

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
around the wire so we can the electrical

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.350 
around the wire so we can the electrical

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
picture of that bill phone I'm using a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.299 
picture of that bill phone I'm using a
modus<00:00:52.690> lab<00:00:52.930> scope<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.739> can<00:00:53.920> use<00:00:54.070> whatever

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
modus lab scope you can use whatever

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.460 
modus lab scope you can use whatever
you've<00:00:54.640> got<00:00:54.670> basically<00:00:55.629> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.870> set<00:00:56.290> it<00:00:56.409> up

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
you've got basically going to set it up

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.770 
you've got basically going to set it up
for<00:00:56.710> current<00:00:57.010> probe<00:00:57.250> on<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.269> current<00:00:58.570> probe

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
for current probe on the current probe

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.960 
for current probe on the current probe
I've<00:00:59.470> got<00:00:59.650> it<00:00:59.739> set<00:00:59.920> for<00:01:00.100> 10<00:01:00.280> milliseconds

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
I've got it set for 10 milliseconds

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.149 
I've got it set for 10 milliseconds
we're<00:01:01.659> going<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.839> turn<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.320> fuel<00:01:02.769> pump<00:01:03.010> on

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
we're going to turn the fuel pump on

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.840 
we're going to turn the fuel pump on
turn<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.670> key<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:05.039> you<00:01:06.039> can<00:01:06.220> see<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.460> pattern

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
turn the key on you can see the pattern

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.969 
turn the key on you can see the pattern
that<00:01:07.780> doesn't<00:01:08.110> look<00:01:08.170> too<00:01:08.350> good<00:01:08.530> right<00:01:08.770> there

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
that doesn't look too good right there

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.010 
that doesn't look too good right there
so<00:01:09.640> we're<00:01:09.759> gonna<00:01:09.850> start<00:01:10.149> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.600 

now<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.710> does<00:01:15.890> not<00:01:15.920> look<00:01:16.250> good<00:01:16.430> it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
now that does not look good it's

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.490 
now that does not look good it's
supposed<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.880> be<00:01:17.030> eight<00:01:17.270> humps<00:01:17.840> in<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.290> 10

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
supposed to be eight humps in a 10

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.830 
supposed to be eight humps in a 10
millisecond<00:01:19.190> picture<00:01:19.549> I'm<00:01:20.360> going<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.570> go<00:01:20.659> down

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
millisecond picture I'm going to go down

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.300 
millisecond picture I'm going to go down
here<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.360> change<00:01:23.360> my<00:01:23.540> milliseconds<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.800> 20

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
here and change my milliseconds to 20

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.450 
here and change my milliseconds to 20
milliseconds<00:01:26.979> give<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> little<00:01:28.340> bit

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
milliseconds give you a little bit

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.170 
milliseconds give you a little bit
better<00:01:28.640> picture<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:31.640> we're<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.119> to

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
better picture and then we're going to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.030 
better picture and then we're going to
change<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.600> down<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.550> 50<00:01:34.550> milliseconds<00:01:36.040> you

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
change it down to 50 milliseconds you

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.730 
change it down to 50 milliseconds you
can<00:01:37.190> even<00:01:37.340> see<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.700> better<00:01:39.369> 100<00:01:40.369> milliseconds

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
can even see it better 100 milliseconds

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.830 
can even see it better 100 milliseconds
we<00:01:42.740> got<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.920> definite<00:01:43.490> bad<00:01:43.850> spot<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.420> fuel

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
we got a definite bad spot in that fuel

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.710 
we got a definite bad spot in that fuel
pump<00:01:45.580> then<00:01:46.580> I'll<00:01:46.700> go<00:01:46.790> back<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.270> let's<00:01:47.539> go<00:01:47.630> back

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
pump then I'll go back to let's go back

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.389 
pump then I'll go back to let's go back
to<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.170> 20<00:01:48.530> milliseconds<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.679> if<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.160> fuel

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
to like 20 milliseconds so if the fuel

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.980 
to like 20 milliseconds so if the fuel
pump<00:01:52.610> happens<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.090> stop<00:01:53.360> when<00:01:53.630> we're<00:01:53.780> down<00:01:53.960> in

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
pump happens to stop when we're down in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
pump happens to stop when we're down in
zero<00:01:54.350> volts<00:01:54.740> there<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.070> pumps<00:01:55.369> not<00:01:55.550> gonna

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
zero volts there that pumps not gonna

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.660 
zero volts there that pumps not gonna
run<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.360> if<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.509> see<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:56.950> your<00:01:57.950> diagnostic

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
run so if you see this your diagnostic

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.560 
run so if you see this your diagnostic
time<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.060> over<00:01:59.240> but<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.840> fuel<00:02:00.110> pump<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.530> oh

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
time is over but a fuel pump in it oh

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.229 
time is over but a fuel pump in it oh
that's<00:02:02.570> not<00:02:02.869> right
