00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
what is the function of like different

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.530 
what is the function of like different
hat<00:07:09.930> like<00:07:10.200> this<00:07:10.470> but<00:07:11.430> you<00:07:11.580> know<00:07:11.610> you<00:07:11.760> can<00:07:12.180> still

test it out yourself and see what works
better<00:07:15.060> for<00:07:15.210> you<00:07:15.540> because<00:07:16.040> like<00:07:17.040> I<00:07:17.190> said

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
better for you because like I said

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.070 
better for you because like I said
different<00:07:17.610> people<00:07:18.120> has<00:07:18.270> different<00:07:18.750> type<00:07:19.050> of

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
different people has different type of

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.470 
different people has different type of
skin<00:07:19.560> so<00:07:20.460> you<00:07:20.520> might<00:07:20.910> have<00:07:21.300> different

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 
skin so you might have different

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.010 
skin so you might have different
preference<00:07:22.260> and<00:07:23.010> also<00:07:24.000> they<00:07:24.150> have<00:07:24.300> a<00:07:24.330> hat<00:07:24.720> like

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
preference and also they have a hat like

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
preference and also they have a hat like
a<00:07:25.080> sponge<00:07:25.560> yet<00:07:26.750> I<00:07:27.750> haven't<00:07:28.470> tried<00:07:28.710> it<00:07:28.860> out<00:07:29.010> yet

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
a sponge yet I haven't tried it out yet

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.910 
a sponge yet I haven't tried it out yet
but<00:07:29.310> I<00:07:29.730> think<00:07:30.060> it<00:07:30.270> will<00:07:30.390> be<00:07:30.540> really<00:07:30.750> cool<00:07:31.290> to

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:31.920 
but I think it will be really cool to

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.030 
but I think it will be really cool to
apply<00:07:32.490> like<00:07:33.000> foundation<00:07:33.810> or<00:07:34.440> even<00:07:34.920> your
