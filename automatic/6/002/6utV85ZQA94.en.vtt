00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
can change the scene mode you know

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.990 
can change the scene mode you know
between<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:54.119> auto<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.659> night<00:01:55.549> okay<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> go

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
between an auto or night okay and go

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.249 
between an auto or night okay and go
back<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> bring<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> back<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.140> then<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
back and bring it back up and then you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.280 
back and bring it back up and then you
also<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.610> white<00:02:02.790> balance<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> have

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
also have the white balance so you have

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.929 
also have the white balance so you have
automatic<00:02:04.890> Sonny<00:02:05.189> incandescent<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939

automatic Sonny incandescent and
fluorescent<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:09.020> then<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.470> color<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
fluorescent and then the color and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.160 
fluorescent and then the color and
obviously<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.390> change<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.840> from

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
obviously you can change that from

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.770 
obviously you can change that from
no<00:02:13.260> normal<00:02:14.010> Sofia<00:02:14.730> black<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.420> white<00:02:15.540> and

negative for those people who want to do

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.070 
negative for those people who want to do

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that most of us probably want to just go

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410 
that most of us probably want to just go
into<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> normal<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.270> I'm<00:02:21.360> just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
can see here we've got two same thing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
can see here we've got two same thing
but<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.600> course<00:02:33.840> under<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.770> scene

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
but of course under you know the scene

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.350 
but of course under you know the scene
modes<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.489> heck<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.850> lot<00:02:35.970> more<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
modes you have a heck of a lot more you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.020 
modes you have a heck of a lot more you
have<00:02:36.540> besides<00:02:37.530> auto<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.160> got<00:02:38.280> user-defined

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
have besides auto you got user-defined

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240 
have besides auto you got user-defined
and<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> close-up<00:02:40.500> mode<00:02:40.860> that's

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and then you have a close-up mode that's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.800 
and then you have a close-up mode that's
good<00:02:41.489> for<00:02:41.700> taking<00:02:41.880> them<00:02:42.060> close-up<00:02:42.450> pictures

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
good for taking them close-up pictures

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
good for taking them close-up pictures
you<00:02:43.410> have<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> portrait<00:02:43.980> mode<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.370> landscape

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
you have a portrait mode a landscape

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.680 
you have a portrait mode a landscape
mode<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.300> night<00:02:45.330> mode<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.319> night<00:02:46.470> portrait

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
mode at night mode and a night portrait

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
mode at night mode and a night portrait
so<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> user-defined<00:02:50.299> basically<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.920> have

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so the user-defined basically you have

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.080 
so the user-defined basically you have
based<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> scene<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.930> Auto<00:02:55.190> or<00:02:59.090> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
based on the scene so it's Auto or the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.350 
based on the scene so it's Auto or the
flash<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.019> can<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.530> as<00:03:01.620> automatic<00:03:02.360> or

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
flash so you can have it as automatic or

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.570 
flash so you can have it as automatic or
you<00:03:03.600> can<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.590> know<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.860> white<00:03:05.220> balance

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
you can have you know the white balance

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.160 
you can have you know the white balance
is<00:03:05.670> automatic<00:03:06.120> as<00:03:06.209> well<00:03:06.390> let's<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:06.989> back

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
is automatic as well let's just go back

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.360 
is automatic as well let's just go back
here<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.650> go<00:03:07.739> back<00:03:07.920> into<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
here and just go back into the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.539 
here and just go back into the
user-defined<00:03:09.030> mode<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.340> rather<00:03:14.340> than

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
user-defined mode and so rather than

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.520 
user-defined mode and so rather than
having<00:03:14.819> automatic<00:03:15.569> flash<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.049> can<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.380> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
having automatic flash you can have it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.310 
having automatic flash you can have it
as<00:03:16.709> redeye<00:03:17.250> or<00:03:17.670> off<00:03:17.880> most<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> time<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.079> find

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
as redeye or off most the time I find

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.440 
as redeye or off most the time I find
that<00:03:19.500> especially<00:03:19.739> at<00:03:20.250> uh<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:21.150> certain

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that especially at uh in certain

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.890 
that especially at uh in certain
circumstances<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.829> find<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.000> having<00:03:24.299> not

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
circumstances I find that having not

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.410 
circumstances I find that having not
having<00:03:25.140> them<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:26.160> flash<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> little<00:03:27.329> bit

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
having them the flash is a little bit

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.569 
having them the flash is a little bit
better<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.200> can<00:03:28.290> adjust<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.400> know

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
better so you can adjust the you know

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.280 
better so you can adjust the you know
very<00:03:29.609> similar<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.420> other<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.260> can

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
very similar to the other one or you can

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.310 
very similar to the other one or you can
adjust<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:33.239> also<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.660> exposure

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
adjust the and then also the exposure

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.960 
adjust the and then also the exposure
compensation<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.400> that's<00:03:35.519> kind<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.790> nice

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
compensation and that's kind of nice

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.500 
compensation and that's kind of nice
because<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:37.049> up<00:03:37.700> or<00:03:38.700> down<00:03:38.760> so

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
because you can just go up or down so

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.240 
because you can just go up or down so
you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.049> see<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.620> will<00:03:40.859> adjust

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
you can see that it will adjust

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.740 
you can see that it will adjust
accordingly<00:03:43.280> okay<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.209> that's<00:03:45.390> quite<00:03:45.570> nice

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
accordingly okay so that's quite nice

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.800 
accordingly okay so that's quite nice
and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.250> also<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.180> color<00:03:48.390> tone

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and then you also have the color tone

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.199 
and then you also have the color tone
which<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.350> what<00:03:49.590> we've<00:03:49.769> already<00:03:49.980> seen<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
which is what we've already seen in the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.970 
which is what we've already seen in the
the<00:03:51.420> video<00:03:51.540> mode<00:03:51.870> as<00:03:52.049> well<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.440> then<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.739> can

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
the video mode as well and then you can

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.430 
the video mode as well and then you can
reset<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> as<00:03:53.640> well<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.140> there's<00:03:55.140> quite<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
reset it as well so there's quite a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.990 
reset it as well so there's quite a
number<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.829> different<00:03:56.160> things<00:03:56.400> there<00:03:56.730> they're

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
number of different things there they're

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.539 
number of different things there they're
available<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.920> interesting<00:03:59.430> thing<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:01.680> also

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
available the interesting thing is also

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.220 
available the interesting thing is also
like<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.819> said<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.390> have<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.690> flash<00:04:03.930> mode

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
like I said you can have the flash mode

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.319 
like I said you can have the flash mode
and<00:04:04.530> then<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.069> can<00:04:05.250> also<00:04:05.430> have<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> sequence

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
and then you can also have a sequence

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.539 
and then you can also have a sequence
self<00:04:06.959> timer<00:04:07.200> basically<00:04:08.040> that's<00:04:08.220> good<00:04:08.370> if

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
self timer basically that's good if

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.530 
self timer basically that's good if
you're<00:04:08.670> going<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.880> be<00:04:08.970> taking<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.450> know

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
you're going to be taking you know

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150 
you're going to be taking you know
putting<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.989> on<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.170> stand<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.739> taking<00:04:11.069> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
putting it on a stand and taking a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.610 
putting it on a stand and taking a
picture<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.549> yourself<00:04:11.639> or<00:04:12.060> whatever<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.450> is

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
picture of yourself or whatever it is

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.170 
picture of yourself or whatever it is
let's<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.739> back<00:04:13.769> into<00:04:14.040> camera<00:04:14.459> here

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.320 

and<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:21.949> have<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.310> sequence<00:04:23.090> mode

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
and then we have the sequence mode

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.210 
and then we have the sequence mode
obviously<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:24.080> know<00:04:24.199> it<00:04:24.410> will<00:04:24.590> take<00:04:24.620> pictures

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
obviously you know it will take pictures

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.040 
obviously you know it will take pictures
of<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.460> in<00:04:25.639> sequence<00:04:26.120> every<00:04:26.389> few<00:04:26.570> seconds<00:04:26.990> or

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
of it in sequence every few seconds or

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.689 
of it in sequence every few seconds or
whatever<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:28.009> also<00:04:28.160> have<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.639> option

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
whatever it is you also have that option

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.570 
whatever it is you also have that option
and<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.630> course<00:04:29.870> finally<00:04:30.199> you<00:04:30.740> have<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
and of course finally you have the the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.460 
and of course finally you have the the
color<00:04:31.820> here<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.830> then<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:35.030> last<00:04:35.270> one<00:04:35.449> is<00:04:35.780> the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
color here and then this last one is the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.560 
color here and then this last one is the
viewfinder<00:04:37.130> grid<00:04:37.759> which<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.300> kind<00:04:38.509> of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
viewfinder grid which is kind of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.120 
viewfinder grid which is kind of
interesting<00:04:38.720> now<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.710> notice<00:04:39.979> that

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
interesting now that you notice that

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.439 
interesting now that you notice that
what<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.400> group<00:04:40.580> viewpoint<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.090> grid<00:04:41.300> which

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
what the group viewpoint of grid which

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.659 
what the group viewpoint of grid which
is<00:04:41.479> right<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.229> middle<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:43.190> you<00:04:43.400> want

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
is right here in the middle if you want

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.350 
is right here in the middle if you want
to<00:04:43.820> take<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:45.560> guess<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.400> want<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
to take I guess you want to have the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.950 
to take I guess you want to have the
camera<00:04:47.900> manually<00:04:48.860> get<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:49.880> better<00:04:50.150> focus<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.810> a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
camera manually get a better focus of a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.110 
camera manually get a better focus of a
particular<00:04:51.530> thing<00:04:51.949> before<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.430> do<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.669> before

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
particular thing before you do it before

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.150 
particular thing before you do it before
you<00:04:53.330> take<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.570> picture<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:54.110> press<00:04:54.380> on<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.680> T

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
you take the picture you press on the T

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.480 
you take the picture you press on the T
and<00:04:55.490> then<00:04:56.090> you'll<00:04:56.270> notice<00:04:56.570> that<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:58.190> the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
and then you'll notice that the the the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.580 
and then you'll notice that the the the
grid<00:04:58.760> will<00:04:59.120> turn<00:04:59.330> green<00:04:59.600> and<00:04:59.870> then<00:05:00.289> you<00:05:00.470> can

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
grid will turn green and then you can

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.680 
grid will turn green and then you can
take<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.860> pictures<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:02.060> will<00:05:02.210> take<00:05:02.419> it

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
take the pictures and it will take it

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.010 
take the pictures and it will take it
much<00:05:02.990> better<00:05:04.780> okay<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:07.780> that's<00:05:08.780> how<00:05:08.960> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
much better okay and that's how the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.740 
much better okay and that's how the
picture<00:05:09.380> went<00:05:09.590> okay<00:05:10.280> so<00:05:10.850> that's<00:05:11.270> pretty<00:05:11.630> much

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
picture went okay so that's pretty much

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.110 
picture went okay so that's pretty much
the<00:05:12.110> camera<00:05:12.320> application<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:13.310> like<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:13.849> very

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
the camera application is like it's very

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.170 
the camera application is like it's very
nice<00:05:14.419> but<00:05:15.139> unfortunately<00:05:15.919> even<00:05:16.180> concerning

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
nice but unfortunately even concerning

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.939 
nice but unfortunately even concerning
the<00:05:17.300> fact<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:17.990> 3.2<00:05:18.710> megapixel

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
the fact that this is a 3.2 megapixel

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.029 
the fact that this is a 3.2 megapixel
camera<00:05:19.720> I'm<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.810> little<00:05:21.139> bit<00:05:21.259> disappointed<00:05:21.410> in

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
camera I'm a little bit disappointed in

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.540 
camera I'm a little bit disappointed in
a<00:05:22.639> lot<00:05:22.970> of<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.240> pictures<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:24.169> requires<00:05:24.650> much

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
a lot of the pictures it requires much

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.820 
a lot of the pictures it requires much
like<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.240> NA<00:05:27.169> 10<00:05:27.560> if<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:29.090> know<00:05:29.210> if<00:05:30.199> if<00:05:30.590> it's

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
like the NA 10 if you know if if it's

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.310 
like the NA 10 if you know if if it's
not<00:05:31.070> bright<00:05:31.370> enough<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:32.389> pictures<00:05:32.900> will<00:05:33.289> come

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
not bright enough the pictures will come

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.550 
not bright enough the pictures will come
up<00:05:33.830> with<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.070> lot<00:05:34.370> of<00:05:34.400> noise<00:05:35.180> or<00:05:35.900> little<00:05:36.289> dots

up with a lot of noise or little dots

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.589 
up with a lot of noise or little dots
and<00:05:36.830> pixels<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:37.699> stuff<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.000> which<00:05:38.449> is

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
and pixels and stuff of that which is

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.060 
and pixels and stuff of that which is
kind<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.840> annoying<00:05:39.080> because<00:05:39.440> of<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.860> fact

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070

kind of annoying because of the fact
that<00:05:40.159> you<00:05:40.340> know<00:05:40.490> on<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:42.080> much<00:05:42.260> cheaper<00:05:42.789> trio

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
that you know on the much cheaper trio

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.670 
that you know on the much cheaper trio
cameras<00:05:44.300> which<00:05:44.780> are<00:05:45.080> much<00:05:45.289> lower

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
cameras which are much lower

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.550 
cameras which are much lower
you<00:05:46.220> know<00:05:46.310> resolution<00:05:46.820> everything<00:05:47.560> sometimes

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
you know resolution everything sometimes

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.950 
you know resolution everything sometimes
it<00:05:48.770> might<00:05:48.889> even<00:05:49.070> look<00:05:49.280> better<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:50.750> I'm<00:05:50.900> a

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
it might even look better so I'm a
