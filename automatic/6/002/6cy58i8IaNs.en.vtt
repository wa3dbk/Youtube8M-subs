bands<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.469> popping<00:00:43.680> off<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.610> why<00:00:44.789> i

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
bands are just popping off that's why i

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.779 
bands are just popping off that's why i
love<00:00:44.879> these<00:00:45.270> thin<00:00:46.039> clear<00:00:47.039> elastic<00:00:47.579> bands

love these thin clear elastic bands

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
love these thin clear elastic bands
because<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.570> pop<00:00:48.840> off<00:00:49.050> easily<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.770> don't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
because they just pop off easily I don't

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.709 
because they just pop off easily I don't
have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.879> off<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.300> anything<00:00:51.570> like

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
have to take them off or anything like

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
have to take them off or anything like
that<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.260> guess<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> product<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.789> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that I guess the product that I use in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.200 
that I guess the product that I use in
my<00:00:54.090> hair<00:00:54.390> always<00:00:54.660> breaks<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.309> elastic

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
my hair always breaks down the elastic

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
my hair always breaks down the elastic
in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> rubberband<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.410> never<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
in the rubberband so I never have to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
in the rubberband so I never have to
like<00:00:59.370> have<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.359> tangled<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.899> my<00:01:01.050> hair

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like have it get tangled in my hair

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.860 
like have it get tangled in my hair
anything<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> highly<00:01:03.660> recommend

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
anything like that so I highly recommend

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
anything like that so I highly recommend
those<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.830> i<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.369> big<00:01:05.640> lots<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
those i think i got it from big lots of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.620 
those i think i got it from big lots of
CVS<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> they're<00:01:08.130> much<00:01:08.250> easier<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:08.970> i'm

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
CVS so they're much easier from here i'm

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
CVS so they're much easier from here i'm
not<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> put

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

is<00:01:53.450> how<00:01:53.569> I<00:01:53.600> do<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.789> yeah<00:01:56.509> I'm<00:01:56.630> just<00:01:56.750> using<00:01:56.990> my

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
is how I do it so yeah I'm just using my

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.749 
is how I do it so yeah I'm just using my
blow<00:01:57.350> dryer<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.890> make<00:01:58.069> sure<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> stretch

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
blow dryer to make sure that I stretch

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.149 
blow dryer to make sure that I stretch
out<00:01:58.939> which<00:01:59.509> sections<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.350> need<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.679> be<00:02:00.830> sucked

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
out which sections I need to be sucked

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.609 
out which sections I need to be sucked
out<00:02:01.310> I'm<00:02:02.149> just<00:02:02.420> toiling<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:03.110> section<00:02:03.500> around

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
out I'm just toiling this section around

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.339 
out I'm just toiling this section around
the<00:02:03.890> hair<00:02:04.159> around<00:02:04.729> my<00:02:05.179> finger<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:08.140> am<00:02:09.140> doing

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
the hair around my finger and I am doing

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.009 
the hair around my finger and I am doing
this<00:02:09.560> process<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.160> little<00:02:10.369> bit<00:02:10.519> slow<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.720> just

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
this process a little bit slow so I just

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.740 
this process a little bit slow so I just
sped<00:02:12.230> up<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.380> video<00:02:12.560> maybe<00:02:13.010> look<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.430> I'm

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
sped up the video maybe look like I'm

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.120 
sped up the video maybe look like I'm
kind<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.930> being<00:02:15.110> roughly<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.040> i'm

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
kind of being roughly here but i'm

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.500 
kind of being roughly here but i'm
actually<00:02:16.250> not<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.890> being<00:02:19.130> at<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.519> video

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.960 

these<00:02:22.900> top<00:02:23.140> sections<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.549> twirling

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
these top sections I'm just twirling

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.699 
these top sections I'm just twirling
around<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.360> my<00:02:25.510> finger<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.530> it

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
around with my finger because I want it

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.920 
around with my finger because I want it
to<00:02:26.769> look<00:02:27.069> fuller<00:02:27.400> up<00:02:27.640> top<00:02:28.829> as<00:02:29.829> well<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.870> I'm

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
to look fuller up top as well so I'm

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.559 
to look fuller up top as well so I'm
just<00:02:32.110> separating<00:02:32.620> each<00:02:32.769> section<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.360> I'm

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
just separating each section and I'm

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.960 
just separating each section and I'm
just<00:02:34.750> wrapping<00:02:34.900> around<00:02:35.200> my<00:02:35.379> finger<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
just wrapping around my finger to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
just wrapping around my finger to
control<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.110> curl<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.530> control<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
control the curl and control the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.809 
control the curl and control the
direction<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.129> see<00:02:42.340> when<00:02:42.489> I<00:02:42.519> take

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
direction as you can see when I take

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.640 
direction as you can see when I take
down<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.269> section<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.810> smooth<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:44.319> with<00:02:44.530> my

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
down the section I smooth it out with my

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.259 
down the section I smooth it out with my
hands<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.099> then<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.340> start<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.670> separate<00:02:46.120> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
hands and then I start to separate the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.880 
hands and then I start to separate the
girls<00:02:48.720> okay<00:02:49.720> now<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.409> time<00:02:50.650> for

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
girls okay now this is the time for

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.710 
girls okay now this is the time for
stretching<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.609> making<00:02:52.000> sure<00:02:52.180> my<00:02:52.329> hair<00:02:52.569> is

stretching and making sure my hair is
stretched<00:02:53.079> at<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.530> root<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.340> not<00:02:54.609> comb

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
stretched at the root I do not comb

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.630 
stretched at the root I do not comb
through<00:02:55.359> to<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.659> end<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:56.079> just<00:02:56.400> stretch<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.459> at

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.330 
through to the end I just stretch it at
the<00:02:57.760> root<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.030> lift<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.079> kind<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.620> shake

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the root and lift and just kind of shake

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.069 
the root and lift and just kind of shake
it<00:03:00.489> around<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:01.389> that<00:03:01.420> my<00:03:01.659> hair<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:02.049> be

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.000 
it around so that my hair can be
stretched<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.480> cooled<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:05.139> look<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010

way<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.159> I<00:03:06.340> want<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.639> to<00:03:06.700> look<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.810> also

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
way that I want it to look and I'm also

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.140 
way that I want it to look and I'm also
taking<00:03:08.200> my<00:03:08.440> blow<00:03:08.650> dryer<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:09.159> just<00:03:09.370> separate

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

out the sections I'm shaking my hair and
I'm<00:03:12.569> making<00:03:13.569> sure<00:03:13.599> I'm<00:03:13.840> moving<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.260> blow-dry

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
I'm making sure I'm moving the blow-dry

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.619 
I'm making sure I'm moving the blow-dry
around<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.280> that<00:03:15.310> each<00:03:15.609> section<00:03:16.090> can<00:03:16.329> be<00:03:16.359> like

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
around so that each section can be like

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.879 
around so that each section can be like
mini<00:03:17.019> burden<00:03:18.599> separate<00:03:19.599> or<00:03:19.989> if<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.409> does<00:03:20.650> get

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
mini burden separate or if it does get

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.339 
mini burden separate or if it does get
tangled<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.400> another<00:03:22.269> section<00:03:22.569> or<00:03:22.870> anything

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
tangled in another section or anything

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.930 
tangled in another section or anything
like<00:03:23.379> that<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.370> make<00:03:24.639> sure<00:03:24.700> it's

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
like that I just like to make sure it's

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.420 
like that I just like to make sure it's
separated<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.650> I'm<00:03:26.769> just<00:03:26.980> getting<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> blow

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
