00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.179
 what are we guided by when choosing a board in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 the first is her size 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.180
 or in other words the length of the board is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.279
 parameter 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 from the top of the board to the bottom of the board in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.439
 expanded form it is selected 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 regarding your height and she should 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.410
 be no lower than the chin and no higher 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.410
 nose tip 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.540
 under me there was a choice what access i have 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.680
 buy let's say i choose a short board 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.930
 surely it will be easier for me with her 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.839
 I can handle it but I wonâ€™t get it right 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.110
 turning technique as well as 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.379
 hold my weight if you choose more 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.600
 long board of this naturally early or 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.040
 late it is painful not to ride 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.140
 your learning process was too 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.390
 long and then not only 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 to fill yourself with extra bumps and a board 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.649
 will be too long then you will not 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.899
 her maneuver and usually long 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:16.060
 boards are particularly hard so 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.060
 how do they exist for high speeds 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.940
 buy the same excavated planks their width 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.890
 there may be different 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.910
 specialized models of boards with 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 classification 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.880
 white &amp; nero if you have a large size 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 legs i.e. more than 44 will suit you 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.290
 likes if in less than 40 you need 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.619
 will pay attention to the boards 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.619
 to the mayor 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.040
 if you have a foot size bigger than you 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 44 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.200
 and the board will be what you need 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 risk catching the edges of the shoes turning 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.150
 or vice versa if you have size 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.340
 feet small board will be wide to you 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.149
 it will be difficult for the board to enter the handle with care 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.149
 her in turn 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.620
 The second parameter of the board is 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 stiffness the board must be stiff and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 elastic 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.170
 usually tough are top 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.989
 boards or about models this board 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.209
 almost does not bend it was created in order 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.700
 to ride a deep virgin soil 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.670
 but she absolutely cannot drive 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.299
 hillocks and not capable for some tricks 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.299
 and so on 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.599
 another case if you take a soft 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:01.099
 the board and try to make a turn too 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.459
 there will be obtained only because the 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.680
 the board will be very soft and the edge will be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.290
 jump from the arc in this way you can 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.290
 control the movement of the board turning 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.020
 the completion of the conversation blackboard we will note 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.940
 what is so different expensive boards 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.940
 From cheap there are four main 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.490
 differences about the model from the serial boards but 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.870
 First is the weight of the board about the model she 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.940
 weighs a little easier 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.660
 what helps you better and easier 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.660
 maneuver 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.060
 the second difference is kickback kickback 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.100
 board spring properties with 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.530
 which board throw you out of 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.730
 turns turns or helps you 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.730
 push out 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.400
 the third is the quality of the sliding 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.170
 surfaces are usually expensive 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.739
 flew to that better hold 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.959
 paraffin 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.959
 more protects the board from scratching and 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.220
 fourth parameter is torsion 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.620
 rigidity this ability will give her 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.420
 resist twisting high 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 torsional stiffness allows 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.520
 board molly steadily keep the arc
