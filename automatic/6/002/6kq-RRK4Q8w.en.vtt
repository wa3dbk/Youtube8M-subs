00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.900
Since you are out of my sight

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.640
You have left me here in a sad blue night

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.100
All by myself

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.700
Wonder why and where you were 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.360
Because my heart is still dreaming of you 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.000
Since the first moment

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.400
Did you see when I was hurt?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.520
Hu ooh

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.560
Oh did you know when I was blue?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.180
I dream of you in every second

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.980
I wait for you as if my mind gets frozen

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.480
Just want to scream out your name

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.980
And I miss you so much

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500
I am still dreaming of you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000
My heart dreams of you secretly in every night

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.620
When you are with the others

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.500
Do you know I have been through all the up and down?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
I wanna wanna get your love 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Never want you to let go

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Cuz I believe we belong together

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.620
If you were sad, I would always be by your side

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.900
And I could be your wings if wanted

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.940
Up in the sky, fly you to cloud nine

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
Through all the weathers it might be

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.920
As time goes by, don't leave me for the other

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.000
Because you are the one who protects me

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Forever and always

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.580
No matter how long it takes

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.140
I will be always behind you, watching over you silently 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.000
Always by your side (x3)

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.040
Forever by your side

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.380
If one day you just left me here

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.660
I would honestly feel so empty in my mind

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.520
You would take away all the songs

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.340
All the melodies in me

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.000
Just take them away from me

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.960
And if I didn't have you that day

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.140
My life would have been so blue

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.840
Because I found myself in love with you, my baby boy

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980
Without the heels you are still girl "on top"

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.600
No need for makeup or lipstick, 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.540
You are still the muse for my music getting high

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.360
In front of all those sleeping stars,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.160
I want to tell you one thing, that is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.720
I can be your lover

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.320
I can be your dreamer

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.360
If you were sad, I would always be by your side

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.860
I could be your wings if wanted

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.580
Up in the sky

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.340
Fly you to cloud nine

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.260
And all the weathers we might conquer 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.000
As time goes by 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940
Don't leave me for the other

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000
Because you are the one who protects me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Forever and always

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.580
No matter how long it takes

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.240
I will be always behind you, watching over you silently (yeah yeah)

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.700
Your lips are so sweet like a cherry

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.400
As smooth as fine wine

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.000
Like no other girls around me

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.700
You are the melody for me to discover

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.640
How long since your first love words, 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.000
All my paintings have faded

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
2.30 a.m, I am wide awake with picture of you in my head

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.920
You light up the night

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.680
You name all my songs

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.120
You make the dreamer boy go through insomniac nights

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.140
I wish rhythm of the rain outside become your lullaby

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.060
My love is one sided

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.000
But it's beyond Einstein's theory of relativity

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'll make you smile, make you fly, make you high girl

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.140
I'll make you smile, make you fly, make you high girl

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.720
I'm gonna treat you right

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.960
Treat you right

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.700
Here we go

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.720
If you were sad, I would always be by your side

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.380
And I could be your wings if wanted

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.920
Up in the sky

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680
Fly you to cloud nine

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.020
Through all the weathers it might be 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.100
As time goes by, don't leave me for the other

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.540
Because you are the one who protects me, forever and always

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.940
No matter how long it takes

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.060
I'll be always behind you, watching over you silently

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.840
Always by your side

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.840
Always by your side

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.740
It's like, baby

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.440
I feel love

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.480
I can be your lover

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.680
Baby

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.260
Come to me!
