something that's been done before but
we've<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.210> unique<00:00:48.360> take<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.870> it

we've got a bit of a unique take on it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.290 
we've got a bit of a unique take on it
whereas<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.129> horizontally<00:00:50.789> opposing

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
whereas we're not horizontally opposing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.069 
whereas we're not horizontally opposing
the<00:00:51.390> spoke<00:00:51.629> heads

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the spoke heads

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.560 
the spoke heads
we're<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.969> opposing<00:00:53.969> them<00:00:54.239> more

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we're actually opposing them more

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
we're actually opposing them more
vertically<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.460> essentially

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
vertically so that we have essentially

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
vertically so that we have essentially
widened<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.989> hub<00:00:58.170> flange<00:00:58.500> spacing<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.370> more

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
widened the hub flange spacing even more

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.029 
widened the hub flange spacing even more
if<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> spoke<00:01:00.989> heads<00:01:01.199> were<00:01:01.320> horizontally

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
if the spoke heads were horizontally

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.700 
if the spoke heads were horizontally
opposed<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.699> most<00:01:02.969> people<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.379> end<00:01:04.559> up

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
opposed like most people do you end up

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.789 
opposed like most people do you end up
with<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.119> narrower<00:01:06.170> inside<00:01:07.170> flange<00:01:07.560> with

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
with a narrower inside flange with

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.420 
with a narrower inside flange with
spacing<00:01:08.420> by<00:01:09.619> spacing<00:01:10.619> them<00:01:10.740> vertically<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
spacing by spacing them vertically you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.210 
spacing by spacing them vertically you
can<00:01:11.549> essentially<00:01:11.880> move<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> inner<00:01:13.220> spacing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
can essentially move the inner spacing

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.450 
can essentially move the inner spacing
of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.909> flange<00:01:15.360> outward<00:01:16.100> creating<00:01:17.100> an

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of the flange outward creating an

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.140 
of the flange outward creating an
effective<00:01:18.080> wider<00:01:19.080> spoke<00:01:19.979> plant<00:01:20.220> spacing<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
effective wider spoke plant spacing and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
effective wider spoke plant spacing and
it<00:01:21.210> also<00:01:21.360> allows<00:01:21.780> us<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.729> lace<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> spoke<00:01:24.180> more

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
it also allows us to lace the spoke more

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.440 
it also allows us to lace the spoke more
traditionally<00:01:25.100> instead<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.270> having<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> couple

this we actually are close enough to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
this we actually are close enough to
where<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.350> weave<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.860> spokes<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.400> like

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
where we can weave the spokes more like

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
where we can weave the spokes more like

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
a traditional 32 hole 3 cross and now

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.920

that<00:01:38.850> way<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:39.540> bit<00:01:39.720> better

little bit tighter system and you can

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.729 
little bit tighter system and you can
also<00:04:03.750> see<00:04:04.019> we've<00:04:04.140> gone<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.500> large

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
also see we've gone with a large

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.880 
also see we've gone with a large

sets<00:04:49.259> and<00:04:49.770> significantly<00:04:50.550> more<00:04:50.759> aerodynamic

because<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.650> thinner<00:04:52.860> spokes<00:04:54.740> we

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
because of the the thinner spokes we

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.129 
because of the the thinner spokes we
will<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:56.629> two<00:04:59.090> aluminum<00:05:00.090> clincher<00:05:00.810> models

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
will have two aluminum clincher models

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.529 
will have two aluminum clincher models
and<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:04.129> guess<00:05:05.129> about<00:05:05.400> four<00:05:06.680> four<00:05:07.680> carbon<00:05:08.219> fiber

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539
