00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.670
 not far from the center of breda 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 light exit road Count Hendrik III Avenue 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 going beyond that avenue is also 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.280
 iii square on Saturday 30 August last 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 year it is almost two o'clock in the morning 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.560

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.359
 pizza still worked 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 even though the branch itself is already closed 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.990
 up to 2 in the morning 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 orders delivered 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.340
 last delivery person has just returned 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 wiener the assistant in the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 manager with the latest work 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410
 busy 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.340
 a few minutes later the delivery person arrives 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 to suck up again 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.820
 as usual around that time 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.270
 the deliverers make their way through the back entrance 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270
 go inside 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.080
 for the bell to say that ours 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.680
 employees to the door that is it 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.250
 they only allow the delivery person to deliver them 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.730
 let him in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.240
 and then a moment came in with 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.240
 balaclava on 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.610
 because hours of terror runs so fast 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.610
 back in an attempt to get help 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.930
 so walk while the employee herself 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.700
 can't move from fear to it 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.830
 manager what is being said 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.439

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.630
 Albert Heijn shopping bags 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.619
 I have to call that we cooperated 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.350

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.070

 ok all this we have they are 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:57.280
 left pretty soon as they left 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.720
 have enough it is suddenly over with 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 they run away from them again 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.830
 they fled through the decline 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.990
 where they fled to and with what 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.019
 has not become clear now it was 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.090
 robbery on August 30 of the previous 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.000
 years and since then this has been a branch 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.190
 2 more robberies robbery that too 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 be investigated by us and we come 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 in a subsequent broadcast 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.700
 but first the surveillance images of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 this robbery 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.989
 on it you can see what happened that night 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.000
 Saturday closer to August happened to 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.739
 the domino's pizza digging hendrik 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 III Square in Breda 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.459
 as soon as the employee opens the door 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.709
 not only her colleague 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.299
 but also two robbers inside the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.109
 the wrong man is the smallest of the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.640
 two he about 1 meter 65 a meter 70 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.980
 he is slightly tinted has a petite 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 build wearing dark clothing and spoke 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.239
 with a foreign accent the man with 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.090
 a gun in a piece larger than one 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.720
 meter 90 he is also slightly tinted 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 a broad build and spoke without accent 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 it was mainly for the people in the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 are very concerned by colleagues 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.790
 annoying because it is nevertheless a threat 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.290
 is from one of a firearm from one 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.489
 stab weapon 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.799
 there was a girl who did here 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.590
 now no longer partly because of that 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.510
 delivery that was there that also has 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.230
 were suffered has not 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 can work more 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.709
 the month after that now has something 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.480
 activities resumed somewhat 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.670
 but has a very strong impact because 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.230
 if there is anyone who thinks to be the perpetrators 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.459
 recognize or who is calling 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.739
 when it comes to the combination 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.200
 of those two the one big the other what 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.810
 smaller and perhaps running 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.599
 with a knife and gun and a blue one 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.400
 albert heijn tas then call the perpetrators 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.590
 must hurry for the robbery in the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.959
 have been around to take a chance 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.640
 wait or to explore 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 who remembers something we are us 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.540
 aware that it has been a while 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.130
 yet people can be those 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 have information for us that we use 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.610
 who can find perpetrators 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.069
 maybe you know something to remember 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.290
 what happened before the robbery or 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.390
 of an a or about the way that 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.610
 perpetrators fled further 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.930
 every little bit of information we can 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.640
 use well 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.170
 the most important starting point 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.700
 this case are of course the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.680
 surveillance images 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.720
 even though they wear balaclavas they do 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.060
 their best not to be recognized 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.709
 look at their way of moving who 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.180
 this something 0 860 70
