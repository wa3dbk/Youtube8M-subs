 it's good a background play to which you have 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.830
 ignore the truth because simply what 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.720
 I have taken from a piece of me from the former 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.520
 play of pokemon light platinum because I 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.410
 I would like to announce the following I am going to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.420

 pokemon sapphire or the ruby thing that 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.470

 sapphire bodies rubina ares ruby 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.510
 I imagine because if it was the first game 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.340
 pokÃ©mon would leave that I had but good of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.710
 every way I'm going to do ruby and the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.129
 Marathon will start at half past five pm 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.719
 - Spanish time - 1730 and well I'll 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.489
 explain more or less in the description 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.440
 of the video the hours to the other countries 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.270
 so you do not have any kind of doubt 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.430
 good you are watching level by the band and 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.170
 is that since it's Christmas new year, I've 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.509
 decided pussy we are going to put snow then 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.340
 because molano and for nothing guys that is going to 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.539
 be the marathon tomorrow I hope a lot of support 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.640
 and the concept the marathon is going to be 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.899
 try to get some but good the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.369
 I really wanted to do a little thing 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.509
 of these for quite a while but let's 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.850
 take advantage and see what are left 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.680
 few ubs are left 200 so we get 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.860
 with to see if we got them during 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.330
 the direct and nothing guys without more you have 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.950
 in the description the birds of all the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.810
 countries so you can not lose it I think 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.730
 which is a reasonable hour for everything 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.930
 the good world maybe in Latin America 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.470
 in some places it is too early 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 but I think it's one of the sites 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.300
 more than reasonable go because of this 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.060
 way none are we going to have 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.910
 a schedule problem to attend is not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.200
 it will not be even at dinner time 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.119
 meal time 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.860
 I do not know is a work that is pretty good 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.240
 because I would start sooner but 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.039
 obviously the Latin American people 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 could have because he was invited at 10 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.670
 in the morning my country is Latin America the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 most people are asleep is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.149
 because I do not know is seven hours of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.979
 eight hours difference I think that in the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.299
 site would be a bit more then mess 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.160
 for everyone then I decided the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.950
 five and a half that is an hour that is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.180
 pretty good and nothing guys no more os 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.800
 I leave in the description the rest of the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.209
