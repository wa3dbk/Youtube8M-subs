00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
wasn't going the way I wanted it to but

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
wasn't going the way I wanted it to but
anyway<00:00:40.219> we're<00:00:41.219> still<00:00:41.600> looking<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.899> no

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

anyway we're still looking at it with no
fish<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.250> good<00:00:44.399> news<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
fish in it but the good news is that I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.209 
fish in it but the good news is that I
finally<00:00:45.300> after<00:00:45.600> mess<00:00:46.379> around<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
finally after mess around with it for a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
finally after mess around with it for a
good<00:00:47.399> few<00:00:47.640> days<00:00:48.050> got<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> water<00:00:49.350> stabilized

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
good few days got the water stabilized

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.229 
good few days got the water stabilized
at<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> pH<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> wanted<00:00:53.640> wanted<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> get

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
at a pH that that I wanted wanted to get

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.319 
at a pH that that I wanted wanted to get
it<00:00:54.329> locked<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> 7.0<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:58.699> cyber<00:00:59.699> aquarist

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it locked in a 7.0 and cyber aquarist

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
it locked in a 7.0 and cyber aquarist
he's<00:01:00.719> been<00:01:00.960> helping<00:01:01.320> me<00:01:01.559> Senta<00:01:02.280> me<00:01:02.399> mails<00:01:02.699> back

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
he's been helping me Senta me mails back

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
he's been helping me Senta me mails back
and<00:01:03.149> forth<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.519> doing<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:07.100> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and forth with with with doing that you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
and forth with with with doing that you
know<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> started<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
know what I started with here was a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.380 
know what I started with here was a
neutral<00:01:09.630> regulator<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> seek<00:01:10.830> him

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
neutral regulator but I seek him

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
neutral regulator but I seek him
thinking<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
thinking that that would get it down to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.109 
thinking that that would get it down to
7.0<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.420> most<00:01:15.960> cases<00:01:16.280> with<00:01:17.280> most<00:01:17.850> people's

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
7.0 and in most cases with most people's

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
7.0 and in most cases with most people's
water<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.990> gonna<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.740> once<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
water it's gonna do that but once I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
water it's gonna do that but once I
started<00:01:23.130> dosing<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> wasn't<00:01:24.000> doing

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
started dosing it and it wasn't doing

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
started dosing it and it wasn't doing
anything<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.009> started<00:01:26.009> looking<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
anything I started looking a little

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
anything I started looking a little
further<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.970> found<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.659> cage<00:01:27.900> was

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
further and found out that my cage was

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
further and found out that my cage was
high<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:29.250> water<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.820> extremely<00:01:30.240> hard

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
high up my water here is extremely hard

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.920 
high up my water here is extremely hard
and<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.530> realize<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.100> quite<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.400> hard

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
and it realize it was quite that hard

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.350 
and it realize it was quite that hard
but<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.229> was<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.210> talked<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
but it was so then you know I talked to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 
but it was so then you know I talked to
him<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.560> went<00:01:40.770> decided<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> use<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> acid

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
him and we went decided to use this acid

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.410 
him and we went decided to use this acid
buffer<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:44.130> great<00:01:44.549> product<00:01:44.790> by<00:01:45.000> seek<00:01:45.240> him

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
buffer and a great product by seek him

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
buffer and a great product by seek him
also<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.500> lower<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:49.189> lower<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> pH

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
also so that would lower my lower the pH

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.109 
also so that would lower my lower the pH
and<00:01:51.450> convert<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> cage<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> co2<00:01:53.670> blah

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and convert the cage and the co2 blah

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.170 
and convert the cage and the co2 blah
blah<00:01:54.240> blah<00:01:55.310> stuffs<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.880> head<00:01:56.909> but

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
blah blah stuffs way over my head but

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
blah blah stuffs way over my head but
anyway<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.290> me<00:01:58.320> close<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
anyway so that got me close down to a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.030 
anyway so that got me close down to a
7.0<00:01:59.729> use<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> neutral<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.079> regulator<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.860> lock

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
7.0 use a neutral like regulator to lock

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
7.0 use a neutral like regulator to lock
it<00:02:02.219> in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it in

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.320 
it in
and<00:02:03.530> for<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:05.070> few<00:02:05.310> days<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:06.060> would<00:02:06.150> go

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
and for the first few days it would go

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.150 
and for the first few days it would go
back<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> next<00:02:06.990> day<00:02:07.290> wouldn't<00:02:07.950> stay<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
back up the next day wouldn't stay a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.059 
back up the next day wouldn't stay a
7-point<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.060> more<00:02:09.300> than<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> few<00:02:09.600> hours

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
7-point all for more than a few hours

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.070 
7-point all for more than a few hours
but<00:02:11.069> now<00:02:11.220> I've<00:02:11.430> been<00:02:11.550> locked<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.030> 7.0<00:02:12.720> since

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
but now I've been locked in a 7.0 since

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.300 
but now I've been locked in a 7.0 since
I<00:02:14.090> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> say<00:02:15.360> either<00:02:15.600> midday<00:02:16.440> Thursday<00:02:16.860> or

blue neons and Cardinals or I'll get rid
of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> blues<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.560> just<00:03:08.489> go<00:03:08.610> with<00:03:08.700> all

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
of the blues and just go with all

Cardinals the Cardinals just pop and
look<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.680> nicer<00:03:12.079> they're<00:03:13.079> basically<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
look a lot nicer they're basically the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.500 
look a lot nicer they're basically the
same<00:03:13.709> fish<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.760> most<00:03:14.940> part<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.630> know

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
same fish for the most part but you know

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.420 
same fish for the most part but you know
so<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:18.600> where<00:03:18.870> I'm<00:03:18.989> at<00:03:19.170> I'm<00:03:19.829> gonna<00:03:19.980> be

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
so that's where I'm at I'm gonna be

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.039 
so that's where I'm at I'm gonna be
using<00:03:21.410> seachem<00:03:22.410> stability<00:03:23.660> for<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.810> first

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
using seachem stability for the first

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.920 
using seachem stability for the first
several<00:03:25.799> weeks<00:03:26.450> just<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.570> make<00:03:27.720> sure

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
several weeks just to make sure

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.270 
several weeks just to make sure
everything's<00:03:28.380> right<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.829> know<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.160> these

discus they're just to me they seem so
much<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:31.739> fragile<00:03:32.160> than<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.670> fish<00:03:32.850> I'm<00:03:33.030> used

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239

thing I worry about you know as the
nitrates<00:03:42.630> nitrites<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.100> ammonia

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
I've never had to worry about water

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.229 
I've never had to worry about water
hardness<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.829> things<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:48.120> know

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
hardness and things like that you know

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.930 
hardness and things like that you know
I've<00:03:48.329> cycled<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.870> tank<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:50.760> two

I've cycled this tank with with two
marine<00:03:51.269> lands<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.650> were<00:03:53.280> already<00:03:53.489> seated

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
marine lands that were already seated

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.569 
marine lands that were already seated
five<00:03:54.600> thirty<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.350> won<00:03:56.510> 160<00:03:57.510> down<00:03:58.140> there<00:03:58.579> so

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
five thirty and I won 160 down there so

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.039 
five thirty and I won 160 down there so
I<00:03:59.609> mean<00:03:59.820> we're<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.090> good<00:04:00.359> this<00:04:00.570> tank<00:04:00.840> Smith

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
I mean we're all good this tank Smith

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.569 
I mean we're all good this tank Smith
cycles<00:04:01.470> since<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.829> day<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:01.980> set<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> up

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
cycles since the day I set it up

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.330 
cycles since the day I set it up
basically<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:04.799> taking<00:04:05.040> all<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
basically just taking all the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.979 
basically just taking all the
precautions<00:04:05.690> starting<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> little

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
precautions starting to have a little
