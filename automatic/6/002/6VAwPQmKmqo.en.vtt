00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.839
 now I think it's very important you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 work in a structured way with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.420
 relation to these proposals and must be 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.070
 a program that you can capitalize on 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 everything that comes from your employees everything 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630
 that comes from the organization structure and this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 in order to put into practice in a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 to be implemented in the organization if 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 contrary the organization will realize that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.850
 You 're not taking it seriously. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 mainly in the sense of giving 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.379
 suggestion and not see them implemented 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.239
 so I think it's extremely important 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.469
 work with it in a 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.320
 structured and put into practice the day 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.989
 the day because when you talk in the sense 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.660
 innovation project when talking about 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 ideas you have to capitalize and have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.879
 that implement and has to generate 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.879
 results 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.010
 Look, I see it in this way. 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.980
 From this scenario we all have to 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 understand the world that lies ahead and 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.420
 practices the procedures of the past 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.770
 it will not necessarily take that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.750
 new future so I think the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.160
 organization, we have to 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 is attentive to new drivers 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.950
 what are the new forces of this new 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.510
 economy 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.420
 Let's get here for example the new 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.520
 the young people who are coming 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.620
 in this new market what kind of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.510
 organization you have to create so that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.610
 really is to an organization 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.160
 attractive for him to have the will to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.080
 come to this organization I see this way 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.700
 one more time you have to have a look 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.320
 for the next years 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.080
 see what you're doing see the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.760
 necessary adjustments and combines with 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.380
 this new world 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 otherwise you have no way 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 not implement innovation and innovation 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.950
 necessarily goes through things 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.229
 sometimes happens through things 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.570
 very simple a procedure one 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.420
 but you have the courage 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.370
 to let that shape aside 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.870
 how have you been doing and making a 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.870
 different way 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.950
 Look, I always said that we have 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.360
 conditions for influencing the future from 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.629
 that you can at least have a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.670
 drawing of this future that the drawing 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.760
 I always say if you have to look at the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.750
 past and see the evolution of this world and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 designing things for this future stuff 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.519
 which we know are irreversible 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.129
 You talk about the greenest world you talk about. 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.590
 the strength of young people within 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.390
 organizations you talk about diversity 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.660
 you talk about inclusion and so on 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.160
 against 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 that is to say as you know that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.590
 this will happen in a way or 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.959
 other 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 You have to work on this future in the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.650
 present because otherwise he will arrive 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.540
 you will not be prepared and tailor 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.390
 What do you work on in this? 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.670
 you influence this new new 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.879
 world I believe this very much and we have 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.129
 worked this way and your eye 20 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.930
 years ago I see that many things 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.879
 we worked 20 years ago 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.049
 believing that he advises in the 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.049
 ten to happen
