one<00:00:15.469> last<00:00:15.619> group<00:00:15.920> of<00:00:16.129> climbing<00:00:16.580> tensions<00:00:16.910> we'd

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
one last group of climbing tensions we'd

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.030 
one last group of climbing tensions we'd
like<00:00:17.180> to<00:00:17.330> talk<00:00:17.509> about<00:00:17.869> are<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.140> French<00:00:18.500> prusik

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
like to talk about are the French prusik

hitches there are a lot of variations in
this<00:00:21.560> knot<00:00:21.830> but<00:00:22.189> one<00:00:22.340> common<00:00:22.789> way<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:22.939> tie<00:00:23.270> it

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
this knot but one common way to tie it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.019 
this knot but one common way to tie it
is<00:00:23.630> by<00:00:24.410> taking<00:00:25.180> one<00:00:26.180> short<00:00:26.570> iní<00:00:27.199> piece<00:00:28.029> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
is by taking one short iní piece and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.120 
is by taking one short iní piece and
this<00:00:29.179> configuration<00:00:29.510> is<00:00:30.140> actually<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.590> Valda

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
this configuration is actually a Valda

three times and clip into the eyes now
in<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:53.989> same<00:00:54.199> way<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.559> rip<00:00:55.010> showed<00:00:55.220> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
in the same way that rip showed this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.780 
in the same way that rip showed this
wave<00:00:55.640> it's<00:00:55.820> Prosecco<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.320> distel<00:00:57.799> I<00:01:00.790> can

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
wave it's Prosecco and the distel I can

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.560 
wave it's Prosecco and the distel I can
clip<00:01:02.119> in<00:01:02.390> with<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.080> micro<00:01:03.470> pulley<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.360> pair

now<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.100> obviously<00:01:16.460> important<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.090> make

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
now it's obviously important to make

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.389 
now it's obviously important to make
sure<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.719> is<00:01:17.899> dressed<00:01:18.200> properly<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:19.340> can

sure this is dressed properly this can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.249 
sure this is dressed properly this can
be<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.789> bit<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.119> temperamental<00:01:20.570> nod<00:01:20.899> I<00:01:20.929> want

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
be a bit of a temperamental nod I want

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.489 
be a bit of a temperamental nod I want
to<00:01:21.350> make<00:01:21.469> sure<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:22.399> I<00:01:22.789> have<00:01:23.179> it<00:01:23.329> dressed<00:01:23.659> now

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
to make sure that I have it dressed now

now tied in an endless loop this would

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.499 
now tied in an endless loop this would

Francois Dusen and we learned by

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.349 
Francois Dusen and we learned by
experimentation<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.189> it<00:01:55.609> really<00:01:55.819> did<00:01:56.149> have

just enough friction to hold us yet when

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.870 
just enough friction to hold us yet when
we<00:02:33.170> go<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.380> release<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.790> goes<00:02:35.210> for<00:02:35.600> us<00:02:35.750> okay<00:02:36.380> and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
we go to release it goes for us okay and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.940 
we go to release it goes for us okay and
these<00:02:37.880> 2<00:02:38.180> hitches<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.690> know<00:02:38.750> when<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> do

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
these 2 hitches I know when you do

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.190 
these 2 hitches I know when you do
release<00:02:40.310> them<00:02:40.610> they<00:02:41.300> really<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.810> release

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
release them they really do release

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200 
release them they really do release
completely<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.250> they're<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> bit<00:02:43.850> more<00:02:43.880> like<00:02:44.180> a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
completely it they're a bit more like a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.080 
completely it they're a bit more like a
splice<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:45.140> way<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.440> find<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.700> sense<00:02:47.000> that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
splice in a way I find in the sense that

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.970 
splice in a way I find in the sense that
the<00:02:47.300> friction<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.840> spread<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.230> over<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the friction is spread out over a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.420 
the friction is spread out over a
greater<00:02:49.340> area<00:02:50.290> yet<00:02:51.290> when<00:02:51.530> they're<00:02:51.740> collapsed

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
greater area yet when they're collapsed

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.760 
greater area yet when they're collapsed
they<00:02:52.730> open<00:02:53.150> right<00:02:53.420> up<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.870> release<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
they open right up and release the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.670 
they open right up and release the
climbing<00:02:55.160> line<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.850> go<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.500> one

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
climbing line and you go so it's one

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.440 
climbing line and you go so it's one
that<00:02:57.770> needs<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.100> used<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:58.580> carefully<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that needs to be used very carefully and

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.750 
that needs to be used very carefully and
because<00:03:00.380> there<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:00.800> many<00:03:00.860> nuances<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
because there are so many nuances and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.270 
because there are so many nuances and
different<00:03:02.120> methods<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.630> tying<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.010> French

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.790 
different methods of tying the French
press<00:03:04.550> X<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.940> different<00:03:05.480> combinations<00:03:06.140> we

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
press X and different combinations we

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.220 
press X and different combinations we
really<00:03:07.430> need<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:08.210> look<00:03:08.420> closely<00:03:08.960> at

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
really need to look closely at

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.440 
really need to look closely at
limitations<00:03:10.010> for<00:03:10.130> example<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.730> mentioned<00:03:11.210> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
limitations for example I mentioned the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.840 
limitations for example I mentioned the

stiffness in a more static rope for

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.860 
stiffness in a more static rope for
example<00:03:22.070> will<00:03:22.430> make<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> difference<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.270> its

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
example will make a difference in its

ability to grab and hold on the rope you

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.670 
ability to grab and hold on the rope you
