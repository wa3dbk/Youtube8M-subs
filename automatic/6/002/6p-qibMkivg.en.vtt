00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
really cute and not too much because

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.550 
really cute and not too much because
some<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> hot<00:02:21.000> topics<00:02:21.030> bras<00:02:21.659> are<00:02:22.080> really

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
they have a lot of stuff going on which

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.479 
they have a lot of stuff going on which
will<00:02:24.870> show<00:02:25.140> through<00:02:25.379> your<00:02:25.590> shirt<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.250> think
