I haven't styled it or anything yet I'm

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.540 
I haven't styled it or anything yet I'm
just<00:05:29.690> gonna<00:05:29.810> let<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.080> sit<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:30.770> then<00:05:31.310> I'm<00:05:31.430> going

to<00:05:31.639> silent<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.599> didn't<00:05:33.050> look<00:05:33.169> really<00:05:33.740> cute

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.960 
to silent it it didn't look really cute
and<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:35.240> that<00:05:35.450> does<00:05:35.840> prove<00:05:36.200> that<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.770> think<00:05:37.700> if

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and so that does prove that I think if

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.210 
and so that does prove that I think if
you<00:05:38.389> curl<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.810> straight<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.410> nice<00:05:39.680> tall<00:05:40.010> straight
