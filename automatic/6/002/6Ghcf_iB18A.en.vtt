safe<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.370> say<00:01:47.850> oh<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:47.910> my<00:01:48.120> gosh<00:01:48.330> right<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.590> use

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
safe I say oh it's my gosh right but use

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.670 
safe I say oh it's my gosh right but use
the<00:01:49.860> Hans<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.670> whatever<00:01:50.940> yep<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:52.080> him<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the Hans right whatever yep make him you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
the Hans right whatever yep make him you
know<00:01:52.800> if<00:01:52.980> there<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.370> five<00:01:53.730> miles<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.480> hour

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
know if there are five miles an hour

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.800 
know if there are five miles an hour
slower<00:01:55.460> who's<00:01:56.460> gonna<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:57.030> able<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.390> tell<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
slower who's gonna be able to tell in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.640 
slower who's gonna be able to tell in
the<00:01:57.900> stands<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:59.460> they're<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.230> 183<00:02:01.230> instead

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
the stands if they're going 183 instead

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.720 
the stands if they're going 183 instead
of<00:02:01.770> 188<00:02:02.220> who<00:02:03.120> can<00:02:03.330> tell<00:02:04.100> there's<00:02:05.100> no<00:02:05.220> records

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
of 188 who can tell there's no records

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.970 
of 188 who can tell there's no records
to<00:02:05.940> protect<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.600> sport<00:02:06.900> like<00:02:07.050> baseball<00:02:07.230> if

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
to protect in the sport like baseball if

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.780 
to protect in the sport like baseball if
they<00:02:08.850> handle<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.200> more<00:02:11.009> squirrely

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
they handle a little bit more squirrely

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.700 
they handle a little bit more squirrely
that's<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.480> good<00:02:12.690> thing

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that's a good thing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.030 
that's a good thing
cuz<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.250> they'll<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.400> more<00:02:14.610> crashes<00:02:15.240> or<00:02:15.390> more

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
cuz then they'll be more crashes or more

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.600 
cuz then they'll be more crashes or more
stable<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.520> guess<00:02:18.560> how<00:02:19.560> about<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.890> let

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
stable I guess how about this let

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.110 
stable I guess how about this let
drivers<00:02:21.440> fight<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.770> they<00:02:23.460> want<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
drivers fight if they want to so you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.250 
drivers fight if they want to so you
really<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.900> old-time

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
really want it to be like old-time

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.380
