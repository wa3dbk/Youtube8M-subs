 hi how are you all now I'm back from cristian chÃ¡vez good for 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.860
 summarize I have a new assistant and now it takes out of videos when I was 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.799
 well that's all in front 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:10.670
 for now 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.839
 are the new assistant I already said that at least 26 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.999
 0 4 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.050
 33 is going to play the worst game in history 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.109
 in atari 2600 unearthed from the desert of new mexico for youtube good 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 when they agree 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.040
 well this game is the worst for three reasons first 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.010
 this game you have to find three pieces of a watch phone or something like that 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.060
 in total of 100 years and it is also very difficult to leave them second your life 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.290
 is in points that every time you walk you get two points 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.470
 leaving you little chance to find them on time third two 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.160
 enemies that chase you is a policeman and a scientist the fucking police is the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.530
 worse not only because it almost chases you everywhere and not because it takes away your 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.860
 parts found by all 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.950
 and 4th and last the icons above only serve to let the worst 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.690
 game since it is difficult to find what you need and if by pure luck 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.070
 you find the three pieces you need a specific icon to go in the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.800
 nothing and there is waiting time for the ship to arrive while 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.000
 this game is the worst of all and has not played it save the hassle since 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.360
 it is worse 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 millaray and less 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 what terrible alone 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.220
 and I also had to laugh 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.540
 atoyac that stretch 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.860
 so let's say the hostages 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.430
 and I hope they subscribe 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.229
 good and one last announcement we have that it is a waste of time or 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 heroes all psychically 26 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.790
