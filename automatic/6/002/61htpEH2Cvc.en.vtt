00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.679
 Hello guys 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.949
 Welcome to listen to demo 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.499
 of course in containers 2000 given deviate 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.390
 My name is jorginho mirim days 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.050
 I'm a gadelha instructor 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.960
 instructor and consultant of sebrae-sp and also consultant of the sinaenco always 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.620
 international business that is a partnership sebrae following duration of the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.910
 industries of rio de janeiro 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.220
 my goal here 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 and talk about 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.249
 the last publication we met 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.249
 of the International Chamber of Commerce edition 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.859
 and after all 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.090
 what is the importance of incompetent negotiators 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.000
 for exporters elected importers 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.800
 their maximum importance and all those employed the exchanges 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.970
 international 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.130
 must be 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.410
 clearly 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.640
 which means each of the three and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 represented by themselves 2 of three meters 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.490
 these acronyms have to be well attended by both parties to avoid problems 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.490
 negotiations between critics 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
 objective of the international chamber of commerce 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070
 with the publication of the incompetent 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.650
 basically 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.430
 transparency to these negotiations 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 make it clear between the parties where the cargo is delivered 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 however, responsibility 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.420
 exporter 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.660
 to oppose the bearer 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.050
 also talks about the division of costs of this operation 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.140
 from which point the importer assumed the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.390
 for the carriage of goods 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.790
 this way too 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 works with the issue of twelve customs clearance and the issue of 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.130
 of taxes on customs abroad ' 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.900
 with that all the important I got demi moore 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.410
 almost all doubts that can arise any negotiation 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.260
 knowledge of the incompetent can often 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.349
 survival of a company 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.049
 in this competitive international market 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.919
 may serve as an example 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.290
 I suppose the Brazilian exporter 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.919
 sport to your cargo through the port of santos 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.939
 about the fabi santos modality 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.889
 according to the International Chamber of Commerce 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.420
 their obligation and 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 put the load 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.799
 aboard a ship 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.239
 however of origin in the case 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.429
 saints 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.409
 from the high sector 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.409
 all risks all costs of the operation 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.389
 to another importer 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.289
 who took over the international freight payment 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.109
 customs clearance 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.309
 northeastern 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:05.019
 payment of customs duties northeastern also internal transportation 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:05.939
 northeastern 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.109
 until arrival 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.869
 to your warehouse to your shed 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.419
 imagine that for a reason 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.809
 this load has been delayed 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.549
 arrival at the port of destination 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.289
 and the load has been damaged 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:25.809
 causing the importer to have failed to get nationalized and I ask 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.159
 how is the payment of this front and international ' 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.459
 if the importer of a forensic agent has a container 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.429
 or as an exporter 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.230
 ended your risk 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.230
 from the moment the cargo was loaded onto the ship 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.019
 in the port of santos 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.989
 by himself as he himself by a fellow countryman 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.989
 the importer must then assume as international freight 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.830
 but since he did not nationalize the merchandise 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.460
 this one refuses to delete any transport the question is and is more than one 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.949
 ask a challenge 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.299
 after all 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.549
 the shipping company must charge who with the freight of who is the real 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.789
 responsibility 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:07.980
 by payment 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.899
 from international freight 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.899
 this is just one of the issues that will be addressed 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.540
 our course 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.709
 in containing 2000 names 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
 I wait for you 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:26.589
