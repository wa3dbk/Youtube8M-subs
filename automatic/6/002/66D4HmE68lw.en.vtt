nice<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.689> light<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.500> basically<00:01:22.799> using<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
nice very light we're basically using a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
nice very light we're basically using a
mixture<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.670> peat<00:01:23.850> perlite<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.360> soil<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
mixture of peat perlite and soil is one

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.950 
mixture of peat perlite and soil is one
by<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.970> pot<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.180> 3/4

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
by one by one so when your pot is 3/4

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
by one by one so when your pot is 3/4
full<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.060> plant<00:01:30.680> carefully<00:01:31.680> place

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
full you take your plant carefully place

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.960 
full you take your plant carefully place
it<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.000> place<00:01:33.240> its<00:01:33.420> strength<00:01:33.750> straight

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
it do not place its strength straight

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
it do not place its strength straight
place<00:01:35.970> its<00:01:36.180> side<00:01:36.420> woods<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:37.290> away<00:01:37.650> from<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
place its side woods going away from the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
place its side woods going away from the
pot<00:01:38.220> again<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.630> take<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:39.900> soil<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
pot again you take your soil and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.980 
pot again you take your soil and
carefully<00:01:41.340> fill<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> pot<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.659> notice

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
carefully fill the pot up as you notice

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
carefully fill the pot up as you notice
that<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> plants<00:01:43.680> vegetation<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> very

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that the plants vegetation is a very

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.719 
that the plants vegetation is a very
very<00:01:44.970> bottom<00:01:45.180> heavy<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:46.590> need<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.700> be

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
very bottom heavy we need this to be

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
very bottom heavy we need this to be
thinned<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> next<00:01:49.320> thing<00:01:49.470> we're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thinned off so the next thing we're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.080 
thinned off so the next thing we're
going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
going to be doing is going to be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
going to be doing is going to be
trimming<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> leaves<00:01:52.009> creating<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.220> sort

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
trimming the leaves creating some sort

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940 
trimming the leaves creating some sort
of<00:01:53.579> symmetry<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.170> top<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.860> the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
right now is always make sure that it is

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.880 
right now is always make sure that it is
growing<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.750> shape<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.350> want<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.770> to

grow every time you notice the tips

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.400 
grow every time you notice the tips
becoming<00:02:52.340> too<00:02:52.490> long<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:52.970> vegetation<00:02:53.960> coming

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
becoming too long or vegetation coming

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.320 
becoming too long or vegetation coming
out<00:02:54.530> front<00:02:54.740> side<00:02:54.920> make<00:02:55.490> sure<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.820> prune<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> to

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
out front side make sure you prune it to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.740 
out front side make sure you prune it to
shape<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.650> plant<00:02:57.940> will<00:02:58.940> tend<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.300> grow<00:02:59.570> really

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
shape the plant will tend to grow really

fast it will grow so make sure that you

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.730 
fast it will grow so make sure that you
throw<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.660> your<00:03:02.810> plant<00:03:03.050> once<00:03:03.440> every<00:03:03.770> 15<00:03:04.190> days

also this if you ever see the plant
growing<00:03:10.430> out<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.700> shape<00:03:11.239> from<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> wire<00:03:12.200> that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
growing out of shape from the wire that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.130 
growing out of shape from the wire that
you<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:13.390> readjust<00:03:14.390> your<00:03:14.570> wire<00:03:15.190> once<00:03:16.190> again

watching<00:03:27.800> a<00:03:28.010> normal<00:03:28.340> plant<00:03:28.610> there's

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
watching a normal plant there's

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.670 
watching a normal plant there's
absolutely<00:03:30.019> no<00:03:30.519> thumb<00:03:31.519> rule<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:35.650> make<00:03:36.650> sure
