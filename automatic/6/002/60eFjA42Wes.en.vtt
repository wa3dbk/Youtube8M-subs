00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.500 
and as a sob now with the amp I'm not
sure<00:04:44.400> what's<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.820> difference<00:04:45.150> going<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.390> be

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
sure what's the difference going to be

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.100 
sure what's the difference going to be
my<00:04:45.960> first<00:04:46.170> time

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.770 

so<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.160> must<00:04:53.460> press<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> volume<00:04:53.970> rockers

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.190 

wait

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:17.339 

yep

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.159 

it<00:05:18.349> means<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.800> lot<00:05:18.919> of<00:05:19.039> difference<00:05:19.960> from<00:05:20.960> my

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
it means a lot of difference from my

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.959 
it means a lot of difference from my
point<00:05:21.379> of<00:05:21.529> view<00:05:21.589> because<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:22.339> think<00:05:22.639> it's<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.819> lot

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
point of view because I think it's a lot

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.260 
point of view because I think it's a lot
louder<00:05:23.240> than<00:05:23.659> the<00:05:24.020> usual<00:05:24.409> one<00:05:25.990> anything

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
louder than the usual one anything

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.089 
louder than the usual one anything
there's<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.569> can<00:05:29.779> feel<00:05:30.080> it<00:05:30.110> like<00:05:30.409> flat<00:05:30.800> or

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
there's you can feel it like flat or

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.450 
there's you can feel it like flat or
bass<00:05:31.339> boost<00:05:31.699> but<00:05:32.449> I<00:05:32.479> think<00:05:32.719> from<00:05:33.289> my<00:05:33.710> personal

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
bass boost but I think from my personal

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:42.489 
bass boost but I think from my personal
I<00:05:35.499> think<00:05:36.499> give<00:05:37.069> it<00:05:37.339> a<00:05:37.490> lot<00:05:37.699> more<00:05:37.909> power<00:05:39.069> to<00:05:41.499> gain

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:42.499 
I think give it a lot more power to gain

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.619 
I think give it a lot more power to gain
more<00:05:42.710> power<00:05:42.949> to<00:05:43.219> speaker<00:05:43.759> so<00:05:44.029> I<00:05:44.059> think<00:05:44.180> this<00:05:44.449> is

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
more power to speaker so I think this is

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.959 
more power to speaker so I think this is
a<00:05:44.659> great<00:05:44.809> product<00:05:45.139> one<00:05:45.589> small<00:05:46.039> tools<00:05:46.400> compact
