00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.790
 ropes of which the shock in well know that 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.740
 also a youtube channel that make many 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.170
 tutorial so if you want to go to 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.090
 see it then the mouthpiece and this e 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.980
 contains these types to close i 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.980
 bracelets that are 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.040
 pink one rose and the other white and then the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.020
 strings of making bracelets 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.410
 one is simple pink and the other is from 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.090
 fuchsia to white a little fox and white and 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:06.220
 bracelets can be short 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:08.320
 bhutan made of many kinds I have nothing 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 finally found because I couldn't find them 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 never if you want to repeat can you have inside 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:23.050
 however, there is a leaflet with the text 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:25.149
 with the tutorial we say and nothing there 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.390
 I repeat to go see that page 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:34.119
 because in short, it is nothing to many tutors 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.360
 now we've been going for a long time 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:42.100
 that I was looking for them but I never found them e 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.550
 finally though I have tried and therefore I am 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.830
 very happy because i was going around 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.830
 in short, at newsstands but I couldn't find them 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:59.940
 nothing this just the sachet this 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:04.060
 leaflet and a 13 type of instructions 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.590
 let's say and you can read with your arms 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.289
 but I repeat, however, they are of many types 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.150
 bracelets 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.409
 and no point I took this cooks and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.079
 fuchsia some is a little white and it is 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.450
 beautiful because i liked that it was a 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:30.260
 little white fuchsia and 8 on this pink one 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:43.019
 this white and this pink skin then 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.239
 these are things and nothing by the way 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.269
 I don't know if you love it 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:59.870
 you see a pink skin and then I took it 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.870
 of the rubbers and they are called the rubbers 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:12.000
 you write with the q and read on one 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 precisely and nothing took him because he didn't 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.159
 they seemed hawaii then i don't know if 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 inside only kawaii anyway 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:29.819
 then they seemed to be firm and nothing 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:32.130
 let's go to open then then there is the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.430
 usual leaflet 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.130
