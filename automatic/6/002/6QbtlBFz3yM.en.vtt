as<00:00:12.380> a<00:00:12.530> semi<00:00:12.740> part<00:00:13.040> was<00:00:13.190> a<00:00:13.220> dark<00:00:13.460> I<00:00:13.610> are<00:00:14.090> the<00:00:14.240> most

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
as a semi part was a dark I are the most

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.540 
as a semi part was a dark I are the most
difficult<00:00:15.440> ones<00:00:15.650> especially<00:00:15.800> the<00:00:16.100> dunes<00:00:16.340> I

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
difficult ones especially the dunes I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.920 
difficult ones especially the dunes I
mean<00:00:16.700> you<00:00:16.820> kind<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.180> send<00:00:17.420> your<00:00:17.600> oats<00:00:17.750> oh

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
mean you kind of send your oats oh

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.260 
mean you kind of send your oats oh
that's<00:00:18.230> fun<00:00:18.500> because<00:00:19.250> it's<00:00:19.400> more<00:00:19.550> smooth<00:00:19.910> and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
that's fun because it's more smooth and

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.510 
that's fun because it's more smooth and
nice<00:00:20.450> and<00:00:20.750> flowy<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.260> then<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.010> can<00:00:22.189> have<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
nice and flowy and then you can have the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.070 
nice and flowy and then you can have the
dunes<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.150> they're<00:00:23.510> doing<00:00:23.720> sis<00:00:23.900> are

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
dunes and they're doing sis are

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.800 
dunes and they're doing sis are
sometimes<00:00:24.349> very<00:00:24.650> very<00:00:25.189> tricky<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:25.970> typically

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
sometimes very very tricky and typically

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.040 
sometimes very very tricky and typically
to<00:00:27.020> drive<00:00:27.260> every<00:00:27.830> June<00:00:28.310> can<00:00:28.910> only<00:00:29.060> be<00:00:29.360> stacked

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
to drive every June can only be stacked

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.290 
to drive every June can only be stacked
up<00:00:30.230> at<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.410> certain<00:00:30.680> angle<00:00:31.300> basically

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
up at a certain angle basically

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.380 
up at a certain angle basically
depending<00:00:33.199> on<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.500> friction<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
depending on the friction of the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.450 
depending on the friction of the
particles<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.260> high<00:00:36.710> places<00:00:36.770> like<00:00:37.250> fear

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
particles but in high places like fear

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.790 
particles but in high places like fear
Bala<00:00:37.730> because<00:00:38.510> it's<00:00:38.629> our<00:00:38.809> drives<00:00:39.140> that<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
Bala because it's our drives that the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.130 
Bala because it's our drives that the
altitudes<00:00:40.400> are<00:00:40.670> high<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.420> sand<00:00:41.780> ends<00:00:42.019> up

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
altitudes are high the sand ends up

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.500 
altitudes are high the sand ends up
getting<00:00:42.410> more<00:00:42.710> abrasive<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:43.940> they're<00:00:44.480> very

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
getting more abrasive so they're very

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.830 
getting more abrasive so they're very
steep<00:00:45.079> jeans<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.160> basically<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.180> hardest

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
steep jeans so basically the hardest

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200 
steep jeans so basically the hardest
thing<00:00:48.079> is<00:00:48.260> when<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.100> go<00:00:49.430> from<00:00:49.610> one<00:00:49.820> gene<00:00:50.030> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
thing is when you go from one gene to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.840 
thing is when you go from one gene to
another<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:50.660> have<00:00:50.840> ray<00:00:51.079> shop<00:00:51.890> steps<00:00:52.430> so

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
another you have ray shop steps so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.630 
another you have ray shop steps so
you're<00:00:53.000> coming<00:00:53.239> down<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:53.600> say<00:00:54.380> 30<00:00:54.680> degrees<00:00:55.430> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
you're coming down it say 30 degrees and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.880 
you're coming down it say 30 degrees and
you're<00:00:55.730> going<00:00:55.880> into<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.149> 38-degree<00:00:56.719> bank<00:00:57.140> end

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
you're going into a 38-degree bank end

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.280 
you're going into a 38-degree bank end
up<00:00:58.100> having<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.579> cute<00:00:58.850> angle<00:00:59.270> that<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.870> car<00:01:00.079> just

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
up having a cute angle that the car just

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.229 
up having a cute angle that the car just
basically<00:01:00.590> smashes<00:01:01.129> its<00:01:01.340> nose<00:01:01.550> into<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> gym

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
basically smashes its nose into the gym

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.689 
basically smashes its nose into the gym
and<00:01:02.739> if<00:01:03.739> you're<00:01:03.920> going<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.399> little<00:01:04.460> bit

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
and if you're going just a little bit

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.520 
and if you're going just a little bit
too<00:01:04.820> quick<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.330> cockpit<00:01:05.660> easy<00:01:05.810> flip<00:01:06.140> over

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
too quick the cockpit easy flip over

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.670 
too quick the cockpit easy flip over
when<00:01:06.910> you<00:01:07.910> have<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.060> little<00:01:08.270> tuft<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:08.990> grass<00:01:09.080> in

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
when you have a little tuft of grass in

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.020 
when you have a little tuft of grass in
the<00:01:10.009> indigenes<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.660> roots<00:01:11.930> basically<00:01:13.030> cement

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
the indigenes the roots basically cement

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.749 
the indigenes the roots basically cement
the<00:01:14.539> sand<00:01:14.840> together<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.190> looks<00:01:16.399> like<00:01:16.580> it's

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
the sand together so it looks like it's

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.430 
the sand together so it looks like it's
soft<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:17.149> as<00:01:17.330> soon<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.569> you<00:01:17.660> hit<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:18.080> it's

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
soft but as soon as you hit that it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.639 
soft but as soon as you hit that it's
like<00:01:18.619> hitting<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:19.190> massive<00:01:19.759> rock<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.929> because

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
like hitting a massive rock so because

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.410 
like hitting a massive rock so because
like<00:01:21.860> pounding<00:01:22.340> Lee<00:01:22.520> they're<00:01:23.149> called<00:01:23.300> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
like pounding Lee they're called and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.180 
like pounding Lee they're called and
camel<00:01:23.690> grass<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.229> I<00:01:24.530> mean<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.009> other

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
camel grass and I mean the other

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.889 
camel grass and I mean the other
heathers<00:01:25.580> little<00:01:25.880> Tufts<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.330> could<00:01:26.509> carry<00:01:26.750> on

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
heathers little Tufts you could carry on

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.620 
heathers little Tufts you could carry on
for<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.440> couple<00:01:27.500> hundred<00:01:27.950> KS<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.149> calls<00:01:29.420> are

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
for a couple hundred KS so the calls are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510 
for a couple hundred KS so the calls are
like<00:01:29.750> working<00:01:30.140> really<00:01:30.289> hard<00:01:30.410> it's<00:01:31.130> difficult

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
like working really hard it's difficult

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.609 
like working really hard it's difficult
to<00:01:31.729> find<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.119> way<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> dunes<00:01:32.630> especially

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
to find the way in the dunes especially

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.320 
to find the way in the dunes especially
when<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.920> are<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.399> first<00:01:34.640> cars<00:01:34.910> it's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
when you are one of the first cars it's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.510 
when you are one of the first cars it's
it's<00:01:35.660> extra<00:01:36.619> hard<00:01:36.830> because<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.190> never<00:01:37.369> know

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it's extra hard because you never know

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.820 
it's extra hard because you never know
what's<00:01:37.819> behind<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.530> find<00:01:39.709> your

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
what's behind so you have to find your

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.070 
what's behind so you have to find your
way<00:01:40.069> and<00:01:40.310> then<00:01:40.429> you<00:01:40.610> need<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> certain<00:01:41.390> speed<00:01:41.840> to

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
way and then you need a certain speed to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.080 
way and then you need a certain speed to
overcome<00:01:42.560> your<00:01:42.679> doing<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.640> if<00:01:43.789> you're<00:01:43.880> too

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
overcome your doing but if you're too

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.760 
overcome your doing but if you're too
fast<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.660> cannot<00:01:44.899> react<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.349> other<00:01:45.470> side

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
fast you cannot react on the other side

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.339 
fast you cannot react on the other side
if<00:01:46.009> there's<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.250> big<00:01:46.459> hole<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:47.000> whatever<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.170> if

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
if there's a big hole of whatever and if

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.139 
if there's a big hole of whatever and if
you<00:01:48.440> make<00:01:48.800> it<00:01:48.830> nicely<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.550> dunes<00:01:49.789> you<00:01:49.970> can

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
you make it nicely to the dunes you can

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.900 
you make it nicely to the dunes you can
win<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> lot<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.750> time<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.740> it's<00:01:51.950> easy<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.580> lose

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
win a lot of time but it's easy to lose

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.029 
win a lot of time but it's easy to lose
a<00:01:52.970> whole<00:01:53.149> race<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.660> rooms<00:01:53.840> level<00:01:54.739> set
