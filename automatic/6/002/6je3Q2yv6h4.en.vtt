00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.920
 friends farmers friends farmer hello 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.830
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 a keyboard that is sent to us by 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 cooler master in a white box 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.739
 so this is one of the very first 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 models a relatively compact keyboard 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.230
 and I will very quickly pass on the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 box then what of course 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.879
 white she will not bring any 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 information this being inside 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 we find a gold plated usb cable 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.399
 braided and worried them what will you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 give an indication immediately on which 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.969
 keyboard type 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 we will talk under this little 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.489
 protection 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 so let's find I'm going to push 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 the box that will not bring us any 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:16.140
 information we will find the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.009
 new cm storm quick fire tk and that's 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 noted here 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.659
 so for once is not once 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.009
 do not let's start from below 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 so we have some pasta 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.630
 elevation with plastic can 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.930
 for the stability of the skates our pope 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 the usb mini connection is there in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 the slice and you have little ones 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 channels in order to handle the output of the cable 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.079
 where it suits you right left 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 center the keyboard itself so very 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.280
 compact 1 I said since 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 you'll notice we do not have any 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.770
 arrows no print screen nor anything 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 all of this so we end up with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 an azerty yachts with a lettering 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 that I find pretty friendly and who 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.750
 will propose to a few things 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.700
 same characteristics as the cookie 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.470
 fire pro that we had received there is 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.470
 little time except that it is more compact 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.740
 so every function key is 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.840
 with a key that will allow you to 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.220
 manage the backlight the mode of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.430
 backlight a few keys 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.170
 multimedia the keys of his and the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 f12 key that will lock 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.330
 the windows key located here in the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.660
 parts in the backlighting has 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.670
 priori seems pronounced and be 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.210
 categorical it must be intriguing to 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.130
 thresh forgiveness with the keyboard the pavement 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.460
 digital forgiveness that must be all 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.100
 much 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.820
 we find the scrolls with keys 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.340
 double and small activity diodes 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.130
 on the num caps lock this symposium on 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.070
 acronym that will not be illuminated as to 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.230
 him on the slices 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.730
 we see a fairly thick keyboard 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.370
 that's normal we are sure of a 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.420
 mechanical the little reminder cm storm on 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.620
 the side and that's pretty much everything about 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.040
 wrist rests we are normally 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.019
 look at the art without Kepler on 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.970
 red switch so with the small diode 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.330
 which will illuminate the key 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.400
 so we're sure the red switch 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.650
 on a keyboard for which I do not have 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.050
 still tariff indication I you 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.489
 give it all in the test writing a 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 compact keyboard that I find 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.680
 particularly successful I find that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.989
 quite nice so I you 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.910
 invite to come read the written test on 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.390
 cowcotland.com should be published 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.130
 soon soon after the video 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.290
 I wish you a good day 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.340
 and in our company and I tell you to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.760
 very soon 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.760
 goodbye
