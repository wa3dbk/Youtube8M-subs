00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.559
 you never fail to reach the condition of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.389

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.149
 we always came to the finals 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.750
 was his greatest achievement so far 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.849
 to run in terms of armada this was the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.739
 greatest achievement title today 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.770
 even because this was a record 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.900
 Brazilians 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.210
 101 armed but in terms of awards 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.940
 in terms of awards I think 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.790
 truck that is worth more than the 10 thousand 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 but nothing more than that and when you 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.460
 You get a vehicle at the awards ends 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.310
 marketing turns into money 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.650
 in kind and that's the way it breaks down between 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.660
 me and my partner someone to hand out 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.320
 next to the award, what is your age and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.410
 to roll 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.630
 I'm 23 years old, there's a lot of road. 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.270
 ahead in a championship said mu 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.760
 par excellence as long as you tie 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.650
 since the age of five years I 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.570
 I started to practice but I will not stay 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.060
 stop after how I was growing up I went well 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.270
 on the horse and following has always been a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.160
 passionate about this activity I always went 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.930
 Since he was little, there is a lot of horse and 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.330
 lace stop sign 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.600
 which is the biggest dream biggest wish 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.730
 project as launcher gained affection 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.680
 rodeo de vacaria where it will fall 1 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.280
 greater than the desire of all 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.630
 pitchers right step in the collection 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.340
 spring-summer close takes a step 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.020
 term world at his feet 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.160
 urbim 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.160
 in the moonlight 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.330
 he suffers 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.020
 the mall 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.220
 date 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 and explosion 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:03.730

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.730
