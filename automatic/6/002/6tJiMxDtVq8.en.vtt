alright if you finished the modification

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.879 
alright if you finished the modification
and<00:04:46.819> you<00:04:46.879> got<00:04:47.060> all<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> pieces<00:04:47.449> into<00:04:48.439> your<00:04:48.590> gun

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
and you got all the pieces into your gun

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.700 
and you got all the pieces into your gun
correctly<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:49.999> should<00:04:50.029> look<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.710> the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
correctly it should look like this the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.100 
correctly it should look like this the
cap<00:04:51.949> springs<00:04:52.370> right<00:04:52.669> here<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.900> catch

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
cap springs right here you catch

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.899 
cap springs right here you catch
mechanisms<00:04:54.860> right<00:04:55.069> here<00:04:55.250> with<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.490> metal<00:04:55.759> bar

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
mechanisms right here with the metal bar

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.649 
mechanisms right here with the metal bar
through<00:04:56.270> it<00:04:56.439> triggers<00:04:57.439> place<00:04:57.710> right<00:04:57.949> here<00:04:58.659> the

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
through it triggers place right here the

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.409 
through it triggers place right here the
spring<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.259> in<00:05:00.289> here<00:05:00.740> with<00:05:01.159> behind<00:05:01.819> this<00:05:02.150> wall

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
spring is in here with behind this wall

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.999 
spring is in here with behind this wall
not<00:05:03.020> behind<00:05:03.289> this<00:05:03.500> wall<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:05.740> return<00:05:06.740> spring

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
not behind this wall the return spring

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.769 
not behind this wall the return spring
is<00:05:07.340> around<00:05:07.490> this<00:05:07.699> yellow<00:05:07.969> thing<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.569> is

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
is around this yellow thing this is

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.529 
is around this yellow thing this is
painted<00:05:09.199> pointed<00:05:09.740> down<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.279> then<00:05:10.789> this<00:05:11.000> locks

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
painted pointed down and then this locks

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.219 
painted pointed down and then this locks
into<00:05:11.810> place<00:05:12.279> with<00:05:13.279> the<00:05:13.430> shell<00:05:13.699> and<00:05:14.229> then

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
into place with the shell and then

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.529 
into place with the shell and then
that's<00:05:15.439> it<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.860> this<00:05:16.279> you'll<00:05:16.669> see<00:05:16.849> this<00:05:17.029> on

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
that's it and this you'll see this on

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.610 
that's it and this you'll see this on
the<00:05:17.629> other<00:05:17.750> side<00:05:17.930> there's<00:05:18.110> another<00:05:18.289> one<00:05:18.469> and

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
the other side there's another one and

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.529 
the other side there's another one and
it<00:05:19.129> locks<00:05:19.430> into<00:05:21.099> that<00:05:22.099> piece<00:05:22.490> right<00:05:22.789> there<00:05:22.969> so

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
it locks into that piece right there so

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.640 
it locks into that piece right there so
that's<00:05:23.930> what<00:05:24.259> loads<00:05:24.469> the<00:05:24.710> guard<00:05:25.449> um<00:05:26.449> so<00:05:27.319> I<00:05:27.349> just

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
that's what loads the guard um so I just

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.089 
that's what loads the guard um so I just
dropped<00:05:27.860> a<00:05:27.979> script<00:05:28.310> um<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.740> now<00:05:30.770> I'm<00:05:31.039> going

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
dropped a script um and so now I'm going

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.860 
dropped a script um and so now I'm going
to<00:05:31.219> screw<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.490> back<00:05:31.639> up<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:32.120> then<00:05:32.240> go<00:05:32.839> to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
to screw it back up and then go to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.200 
to screw it back up and then go to
firing<00:05:33.169> test<00:05:33.439> all<00:05:34.400> right<00:05:34.550> now<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.759> guns<00:05:35.029> all

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
firing test all right now the guns all

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.510 
firing test all right now the guns all
back<00:05:35.389> together<00:05:35.629> the<00:05:36.620> caches<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.069> everything

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
back together the caches and everything

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.929 
back together the caches and everything
i'm<00:05:37.669> just<00:05:37.819> going<00:05:37.939> to<00:05:37.969> you<00:05:38.060> on<00:05:38.149> a<00:05:38.180> firing<00:05:38.479> test

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:39.939 
i'm just going to you on a firing test

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.879 
i'm just going to you on a firing test
now<00:05:40.939> for<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.599> original<00:05:42.050> eliminator<00:05:42.710> it's

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
now for the original eliminator it's

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.320 
now for the original eliminator it's
going<00:05:43.009> to<00:05:43.069> be<00:05:43.129> probably<00:05:43.430> five<00:05:43.699> to<00:05:43.909> ten<00:05:44.120> Pete

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
going to be probably five to ten Pete

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.709 
going to be probably five to ten Pete
hit<00:05:44.719> ten<00:05:45.080> feet<00:05:45.289> more<00:05:45.409> powerful<00:05:45.939> not<00:05:46.939> much<00:05:47.210> more

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
hit ten feet more powerful not much more

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.360 
hit ten feet more powerful not much more
just<00:05:48.110> because<00:05:48.199> it's<00:05:48.500> only<00:05:48.770> a<00:05:48.800> narrow<00:05:48.979> stricter

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
just because it's only a narrow stricter

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.070 
just because it's only a narrow stricter
mod<00:05:49.520> if<00:05:49.639> you<00:05:49.759> want<00:05:49.939> to<00:05:50.029> make<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.569> more<00:05:50.689> powerful

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
mod if you want to make it more powerful

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.389 
mod if you want to make it more powerful
to<00:05:51.169> replace<00:05:51.469> the<00:05:51.649> spring<00:05:51.919> in<00:05:52.099> the<00:05:52.189> cap

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:52.399 
to replace the spring in the cap

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.969 
to replace the spring in the cap
Springer<00:05:52.879> do<00:05:53.870> something<00:05:54.199> else<00:05:54.379> so<00:05:54.649> let<00:05:54.949> me

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
Springer do something else so let me

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:04.450 
Springer do something else so let me
connect<00:05:55.250> this<00:05:55.339> real<00:05:55.520> quick<00:06:03.099> how<00:06:04.099> about<00:06:04.250> that

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
connect this real quick how about that

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.079 
connect this real quick how about that
and<00:06:04.699> on<00:06:05.089> the<00:06:05.180> hub<00:06:05.349> and<00:06:06.349> it's<00:06:07.099> like<00:06:07.370> I<00:06:07.490> said<00:06:07.699> five

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.089 
and on the hub and it's like I said five

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.629 
and on the hub and it's like I said five
to<00:06:08.240> ten<00:06:08.389> more<00:06:08.539> powerful<00:06:09.199> it's<00:06:09.349> still<00:06:09.639> pretty

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
to ten more powerful it's still pretty

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.879 
to ten more powerful it's still pretty
accurate<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.300> very<00:06:11.449> good<00:06:11.810> for<00:06:12.139> its<00:06:12.289> small

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
accurate and very good for its small

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.699 
accurate and very good for its small
size<00:06:13.069> that's
