 Welcome to the interview today 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.480
 Kaiser Franz he is a bit 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.260
 branded and mario preining mario you 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.059
 do ego and what egoist that explains 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.470
 now that you are explaining us now 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.390
 You can already see a bit here 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.820
 a bike in the way and that has ego too 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.100
 do what is behind it 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.260
 children's films eg sports are diego pte 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.170
 here there is a retrofit kit of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.750
 strongest saturdays in the world you can 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.780
 Almost every one comes down here 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.460
 exactly a standard bicycle 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.900
 so to speak and here comes this 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.640
 Retrofit kit knows one knows somehow 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.320
 the e bikes are out there 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 most of the time sitting around 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.500
 any race on it 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.129
 they are looking forward to being a bit faster now 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
 can drive 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.720
 but that is not made for pensioners 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.390
 that's for people we say under 60 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.950
 made the really blatant 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.630
 want it and that just in the in 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 the mountains not only very fast 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.370
 downhill rider but also april 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.230
 want to be very fast in the room 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.850
 it came to development at all like who 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.560
 What kind of a fixed idea was that 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.560
 stood behind it and how did you then in 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.080
 The did Yahoo idea about 2008 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.530
 Gaisberg said my brother's down 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.320
 approach help 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.750
 Ghosts there is no lift to break 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.150
 come and I had no time around him 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 up to the circuit with the car now 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.740
 was just considered and then that is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.680
 idea why not a motorcycle and come 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.190
 escalate and on the bike a motor 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.890
 build and thus so 3 ps on the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.950
 to control bicycle by throttle 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.570
 and when to use the throttle grip 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.550
 here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.200
 now yes 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 Photo middle engine system very important for 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.399
 the handling 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.110
 and the battery and that is different 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.580
 on most e bikes you have 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.230
 not on the bike but you have 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.680
 actually on the back exactly 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 Battery is two advantages in the backpack 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 point one handling the bike is like that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.410
 as easy as possible 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.629
 we want when we have seen 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.450
 want a stable air situation that's why 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.480
 also with the long jump world records 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.010
 situated at 22 meters 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 the miracle of a handy and point 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
 two provable yes I have to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.459
 I do not fix the battery on the frame 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.959
 I have her in my backpack and thus 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.640
 Two fly with one stone only 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.340
 Advantages because the back is mine 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.910
 quietest point on the system engine and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.920
 human ok 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 Now you have the idea and then 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.490
 how did you go then you just have 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.840
 fiddled or something comes at some point 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.130
 Of course in the area there it will be 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.450
 also a bit expensive probably 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.430
 he inevitably develops something like that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.530
 not for 1 euro 50 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.970
 how do you have a business therefore money 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.030
 to catch up and people from it too 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.700
 convince that's a cool idea 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.490
 2010 went public in 2011 the fire 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.740
 new award won at ispo das 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.620
 It was or breakthrough worldwide 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.000
 attention 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 and also demand 2012 though 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.980
 further developed and sold 300 pieces 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.659
 and now a four-digit number 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.909
 in demand and the number of pieces can be 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.220
 now only agree with new ones 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.430
 production means and exactly for these 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.590
 Central are the bayern is to education 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.280
 do that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.769
 pulse4 from the crowd funding story 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.040
 All right then it goes around where are 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:49.290
 your still aim for each and 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.519
 every mountain and every bike runs his 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.230
 an agreement in any case much ego 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.239
 Smiles to many people in the world 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.280
 donate because it is still none 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.680
 dismounted without proper miles 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.799
 face who will be for evans on the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.930
 bike ride and thus 50 60 km h in 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.380
 the plane through the single trails 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.849
 the forest is still really fun 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.569
 yes I wish you a lot of success cool 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.190
 thing and I'm curious if I soon 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.989
 in the woods here too in the one 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.190
 or other ego drive very many 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.190
 thanks for are thank you
