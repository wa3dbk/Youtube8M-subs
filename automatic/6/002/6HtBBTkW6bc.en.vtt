for tutorial this video is when you
cover<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> lot<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> information<00:00:15.389> about<00:00:15.839> setting

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
cover a lot of information about setting

up spawning and forge note this can get
a<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.960> complex<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.470> spawning<00:00:19.740> system

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
a little complex that spawning system

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.000 
a little complex that spawning system
has<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> interest<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:22.380> end<00:00:22.529> all<00:00:22.769> you

has a lot of interest in the end all you
really<00:00:23.189> need<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> function<00:00:24.240> map

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
really need to know for a function map
is<00:00:24.570> how<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> play<00:00:24.869> spawns<00:00:25.430> we'll<00:00:26.430> cover<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
is how to play spawns we'll cover that

respawn at spawn points placed on the
map<00:00:40.520> there<00:00:41.520> are<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.700> types<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> spawn<00:00:42.480> points

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
initial spawns and respawn points the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.880 
initial spawns and respawn points the
difference<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.680> pretty

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
difference here is pretty

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
difference here is pretty
straightforward<00:00:47.100> initial<00:00:48.030> spawns<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.450> only

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
straightforward initial spawns are only

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
straightforward initial spawns are only
used<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> start<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> match<00:00:49.879> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
used at the start of the match it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
used at the start of the match it's
important<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.390> placing<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> specify

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
important when placing these to specify

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.779 
important when placing these to specify
which<00:00:52.410> team<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> spawn<00:00:53.399> there<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
which team you want to spawn there and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.250 
which team you want to spawn there and
then<00:00:54.239> provide<00:00:54.480> enough<00:00:54.750> points<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
then provide enough points for the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
then provide enough points for the
entire<00:00:55.500> team<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:55.800> falling<00:00:56.039> together<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
entire team that's falling together and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
entire team that's falling together and
so<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.960> idea<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> place<00:00:58.379> 8<00:00:58.590> initial<00:00:59.100> spawns

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so your idea to place 8 initial spawns

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.229 
so your idea to place 8 initial spawns
protein<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.969> make<00:01:00.030> sure<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.480> enough

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
protein to make sure you have enough

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.939 
protein to make sure you have enough
after<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> initial<00:01:03.629> spawn<00:01:03.809> respawn<00:01:04.619> points

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
after the initial spawn respawn points

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.289 
after the initial spawn respawn points
will<00:01:05.070> handle<00:01:05.460> spawning<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> rest<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
will handle spawning for the rest of the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.600 
will handle spawning for the rest of the
match<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.740> idea<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> place<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
match it's a good idea to place a lot of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
match it's a good idea to place a lot of
these<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.850> map<00:01:09.090> generally<00:01:09.780> speaking<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
these on your map generally speaking the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.179 
these on your map generally speaking the
more<00:01:10.229> spawn<00:01:10.560> points<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> choose

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
more spawn points there are to choose

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.679 
more spawn points there are to choose
from<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> better<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> spawning<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.570> be

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
from the better of the spawning will be

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
from the better of the spawning will be
as<00:01:13.040> an<00:01:14.040> example<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.520> many<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:14.880> amount

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
as an example how many is good amount

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
as an example how many is good amount
there<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.840> 70<00:01:16.259> respawn<00:01:16.590> points<00:01:16.890> placed
