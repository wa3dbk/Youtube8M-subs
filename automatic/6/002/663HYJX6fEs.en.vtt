00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
say he's all the way soft but he seems

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
say he's all the way soft but he seems
to<00:01:52.950> present<00:01:53.250> himself<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.820> he<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.149> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
