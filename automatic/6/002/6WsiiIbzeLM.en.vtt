00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.790 
it back and sometimes when you're in a
slump<00:00:56.750> maybe<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.230> keep<00:00:58.380> doing<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> right

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
slump maybe you keep doing the right

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
slump maybe you keep doing the right
things<00:00:59.040> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> keep<00:00:59.430> working<00:00:59.490> hard<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
things and you keep working hard you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
things and you keep working hard you
just<00:01:00.990> need<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.040> two<00:01:02.190> matches<00:01:02.700> to<00:01:03.000> turn

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
