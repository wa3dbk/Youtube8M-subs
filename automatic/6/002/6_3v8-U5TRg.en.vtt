swing set that's very easy to put

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.430 
swing set that's very easy to put
together<00:00:07.550> doesn't<00:00:08.550> take<00:00:08.700> much<00:00:08.940> time<00:00:09.320> save<00:00:10.320> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
together doesn't take much time save you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.430 
together doesn't take much time save you
a<00:00:10.469> lot<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> money<00:00:10.860> over<00:00:11.040> buying<00:00:12.170> so<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.290> can

a lot of money over buying so you can

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.160 
a lot of money over buying so you can
see<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> construction<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:15.360> simply

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
see the construction of this it's simply

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.300 
see the construction of this it's simply
to<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:17.660> a-frames<00:00:18.660> at<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> end<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> beam

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to a a-frames at the end with the beam

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939 
to a a-frames at the end with the beam
across<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.880> top<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.619> then<00:00:22.619> there's<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
across the top and then there's the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
across the top and then there's the
swing<00:00:23.220> song<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.600> easy<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.990> well<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
swing song on it be very easy as well to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.400 
swing song on it be very easy as well to
take<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.710> build<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.920> platform<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.820> end<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
take and build a platform on one end and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.259 
take and build a platform on one end and
secure<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.650> slide<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.970> let's<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
secure a slide to it so let's take a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.060 
secure a slide to it so let's take a
closer<00:00:30.570> look<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.200> a-frame<00:00:34.649> we've<00:00:34.860> got

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
closer look on the a-frame we've got

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 
closer look on the a-frame we've got
some<00:00:35.280> 4x4<00:00:35.880> posts<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.050> been<00:00:37.170> put

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.980 
mess there leave it looking a little bit
nicer<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.350> once<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.470> construct<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> two<00:02:15.990> 2a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
nicer so once you construct the two 2a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.160 
nicer so once you construct the two 2a

frames put the beam up and then it's

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.199 
frames put the beam up and then it's
simply<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> matter<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.830> securing<00:02:21.400> whatever
