00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
if it came into play but obviously the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.970 
if it came into play but obviously the
weather<00:01:53.450> wasn't<00:01:53.960> as<00:01:54.170> big<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.500> factor<00:01:54.680> as<00:01:54.860> we

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
weather wasn't as big of a factor as we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
thought but canard was definitely on it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.420

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
Wilson all over poor cell and then a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.700 
Wilson all over poor cell and then a
couple<00:01:58.640> laps<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.090> purcell<00:01:59.510> they<00:02:00.380> were<00:02:00.440> side<00:02:00.680> by

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
couple laps in purcell they were side by

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.230 
couple laps in purcell they were side by
side<00:02:01.070> he<00:02:01.100> actually<00:02:01.190> waved<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:01.850> Wilson<00:02:02.150> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
side he actually waved at Wilson and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600 
side he actually waved at Wilson and
said<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:03.350> was<00:02:03.440> fun<00:02:03.620> but<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:03.979> gotta<00:02:04.190> go<00:02:04.370> he

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
said that was fun but I gotta go he

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.280 
said that was fun but I gotta go he
checked<00:02:04.880> out<00:02:05.090> yeah<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:05.870> we<00:02:06.020> saw<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
checked out yeah and then we saw the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.199 
checked out yeah and then we saw the
real<00:02:06.680> poor<00:02:06.950> cell<00:02:07.159> i<00:02:07.190> guess<00:02:07.550> as<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:07.940> said<00:02:08.179> i

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
real poor cell i guess as you said i

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.759 
real poor cell i guess as you said i
think<00:02:08.390> we're<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.869> might<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.229> just<00:02:09.349> been<00:02:09.560> sort

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
think we're so might have just been sort

out<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:24.090> front<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.959> first<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.470> battle<00:03:25.739> is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
out out front so first the battle is

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.589

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.920 
thinking it to get to second that could
be<00:03:29.190> good<00:03:29.280> enough<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.670> overall<00:03:29.910> they<00:03:30.720> went

you<00:06:00.680> know<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:00.830> thought<00:06:01.580> that<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.979> track<00:06:04.219> was<00:06:04.339> a

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
you know I thought that the track was a

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.129 
you know I thought that the track was a
little<00:06:04.639> sketchy<00:06:04.849> with<00:06:05.180> with<00:06:05.719> the<00:06:05.810> lighting

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
little sketchy with with the lighting

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.499 
little sketchy with with the lighting
but<00:06:06.889> I<00:06:07.189> thought<00:06:07.520> it<00:06:07.639> was<00:06:07.729> a<00:06:07.759> cool<00:06:08.000> venue<00:06:08.270> you
