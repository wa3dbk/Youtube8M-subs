00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 we will work on the equations of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 right these are pretty notions 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.340
 new to you and you will see 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 yet there are many similarities 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 with the affine functions that you have 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.060
 already seen partly in third and that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 you will see again this year in a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.510
 plan minutes a landmark figure 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.939
 behind my back we'll watch her 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 detail just after all right in fact to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.850
 an equation then an equation of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 right this is what allows to do the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.710
 difference between a straight line and another 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.930
 every particular right to his 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 particular equation in short there are two 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 possibilities be the rights are 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 parallel to laxou y / y this is where 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 messy for example if my right d1 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.860
 here the equations of the form of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 right d1 will all be equations of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.969
 the form x equals kaka is a real 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.699
 whichever one we will be 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.739
 brought she therefore determines right 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.409
 parallel to the ordered order x equal case 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.260
 for all others when they are 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.570
 so that's when alex messy that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
 could be here the brown right or the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 blue right you see well she's 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.729
 that's when with the orderly focus and well 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.900
 all of these right there are going to have a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.310
 equation called the equation 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.479
 reduced from a right it's 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.560
 basically an excellent if we 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.189
 work there equals something xx more 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.140
 Something 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 so sometimes in the mails a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.100
 marked at x + b by the way that's what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.900
 I do it below times it's nx 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.829
 more p you have to get used to all these 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.439
 different languages 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.479
 in any case m &amp; p are numbers these are 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.369
 any real some 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.030
 can be worth 0 we will see in which 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.350
 case things absolutely to know because 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 that we are in the definitions the number 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.909
 em the one who is before x is called the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.979
 guideline coefficient in short this is 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 whoever is going to give 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.700
 the inclination of the right do we 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 is more or less vertical anymore or 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.049
 less horizontal is that number 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.640
 that he will give this parameter there the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.700
 second number the ep number one 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.409
 call them to give them the origin and well 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.930
 in fact this one will allow us to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.200
 find out where 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.120
 our right will cut the order here here 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.489
 you see for example 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.129
 I am between 0 and 1 presumably 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.830
 that my shadow peace will be around 0.4 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.840
 for example here it will be 3 to all 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.239
 so blows the ep number that is marked 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 here in red is the value of their 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.409
 data when we are facing zero here 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.739
 that is to say when cutting access 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.360
 ordered a little important thing i 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.390
 have not drawn here but if by chance you 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.040
 have two equations of right one right 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.470
 of elton right delta premiums they have 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.959
 are of the form to explain and prices 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.310
 more depressed mix well these two straight 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.349
 will be parallel that's handy 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.970
 if it announces itself if they have the same 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.170
 coefficient guideline it's written in 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 your yard all letters 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.920
 I did a little summary here a 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.720
 two parallel lines same coefficient 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.489
 director so that's for the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.829
 equations reduced of course if you have 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.019
 two equations of the form x hegalka and 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.459
 x hegalka premiums ie right 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.569
 like right orange they're going to be 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.310
 parallel as naturally 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.739
 so what are we going to do here I 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 represented 3 right and we'll try to 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.870
 see which family by right she 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.440
 belong to a l and vertical lighthouse 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.579
 vertical 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.840
 that does not mean a lot 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.590
 especially parallel to the ordinate 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.989
 so l is of the form x hegalka and xc 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.290
 the value of abc ce for any 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.819
 what a point here if you take a point 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.310
 somewhere what are they all 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.200
 two particulars all these points there is 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.129
 well of course that the many 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.510
 geeks the x-axis is worth less everywhere 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.980
 they were given no matter what he is 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.019
 variable he will describe all the real 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.540
 so as the number x is always worth 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:47.060
 less of the equation of the right on of 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.069
 the form x equals less than the blue it 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.220
 was a little bit in the same spirit 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.250
 if you take a point anywhere here 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.019
 or there no matter all these points there 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.209
 account he particularly good you see 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.980
 that order them all are in front of the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.069
 3 Many ie this time 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.699
 is the number 3, which are identified Raissi 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.530
 systematically it means that our 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.449
 value of xl going to walk around my 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.970
 infinite a + infinity on the other hand the 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:18.380
 value of y will be fixed so here it is 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.709
 who wins 3 so I put a space here 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.889
 expressly because 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.340
 in fact it's still an equation of 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.780
 mxx + peace form have pc3 number 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.759
 simply because there we can 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.440
 mark zero x + 3 makes it the 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.120
 coefficient steer your heroes but he 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.250
 there is one there is no coefficient 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.840
 director on the other hand here there is a 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.729
 guideline coefficient as soon as you have 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.050
 a horizontal line is a 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.150
 steering coefficient that is zero well 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.560
 sure the zero x you do not write it in 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.539
 the subjects plays the writings there for you 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.970
 show that there is a coefficient 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.500
 director and then the right of the cats and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.389
 the big right majorities we're going 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.639
 meet they are when is alex 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.380
 messy here we will not calculate 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.090
 neil coefficient director because 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.430
 I have no particular points here 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.099
 just be aware that it will be 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.620
 of the form and mixed or spe one goes from 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.669
 to be interested in following videos 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.740
 to the different processes that allow 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.539
 to find that m 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.960
 and this country is for the equations 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.960
 right
