00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.509
 playing with you and doing 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.570
 please tell me in tatar will 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.860
 im land signature to them for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.760
 the language honestly the first two words 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.710
 communication on 3 seems to me to the root of the word 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.180
 closer to the signature in the signature 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.740
 so I go for the mind of the hall of course 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 Well, probably happen all the same moment 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.480
 she never works, I mean 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.579
 feminine to human is wrong time 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 course well it is necessary here at this moment it 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.730
 falling asleep female logic wakes up 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.820
 male intuition already felt 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.770
 comfortable and thought that it would already be possible 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 worthy to lose 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:57.440
 signature and little or im for writing it 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.440
 but not the signature this signature and mla 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.840
 launching there is a letter of arrival 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.729
 let them be for all the same original 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.460
 logs which are barns where there is a letter 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.500
 All right, my quality I took the language 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.220
 vici also have letters correctly 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.869
 and this is the correct option 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.130
 they sign it and mla 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 This spelling but Yazoo this writing 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 such a little trick 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.369
 play on and play with you bushes like 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.030
 in Tatar will be a protocol in rhythm 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.290
 were shmi bairak 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.360
 so burkett on if it were berg whales 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.909
 maybe not one has gone white 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.600
 something such bel can be knowledge here 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.159
 and personally and by the way knowledge but when 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.750
 you are written by a traffic police officer and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.009
 before new knowledge appeared receive and 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.759
 no experience experience bairak at all word 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:10.220
 unknown I will be ill at the shooting range 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.660
 All did so only I but the fact is that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.430
 Rustam each time getting in hand 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.230
 protocol gets some new knowledge 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.610
 therefore, it seems to him that the protocol by 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 Tatarsky will but only me
