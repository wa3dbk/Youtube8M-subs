 a series of video lessons for beginners 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.129
 sony alpha camera users 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 I would like to dedicate today's video 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 focus area settings you are essentially 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.699
 sony camera 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 ability to use area setting 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 Focusing allows you to reliably 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.909
 convey the essence of what is happening through 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.650
 photograph highlight the main object on 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.250
 background secondary and create 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.739
 artistic effects on the picture so 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.949
 let's learn how to tune and correctly 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.440
 use different kinds of areas 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.940
 autofocus 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.950
 setting the autofocus area 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.280
 sony alpha cameras available in all 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.330
 modes except scene mode auto-mode and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.190
 panorama mode 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.380
 in order to customize the area 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.479
 Autofocus needs to be set to 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.850
 mode dial that mode 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.619
 which you will work for me now 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.410
 for example , the priority mode is set 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.960
 aperture and then with the key 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.869
 joystick function select icon 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.030
 area and with to enter the setting 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.150
 enough autofocus area 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.130
 click on the center of the joystick 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.890
 there is one more shorter way for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.899
 autofocus area settings this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.670
 use of programmed hot 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.799
 keys on the camera body 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.770
 more information about 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.240

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.640
 . 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.830
 therefore most of the objects on 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 The picture will be sharp and this option 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.510
 Focusing is suitable for shooting and holding

 focus mode is pinpoint mode 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.139
 focusing mode is accurate focusing like 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.329
 can not be better suited for shooting

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.209
 want to highlight the main object in the background 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.889
 other objects in exact mode 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.870
 autofocus focus adjustment 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.780
 happens on the point located in the center 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.919
 frame but not always 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.630
 the object to be photographed is by 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.910
 center 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.180
 most often from shifted to the left or right 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.010
 third overs to

 photographed object in the picture 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.830
 turned out sharp despite its 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.170
 location 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.240
 you need to bring the focus point to 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.830

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.230
 shutter key halfway

 turned up in the desired part of the frame here 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.070
 it is important to remember that moving the camera 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.500
 important in one plane with respect to 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.410
 subject ie right left or up 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.750
 down but by no means forward or 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.920
 not back otherwise the object will not 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.170
 sharp and last mode 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.610

 sharpness is adjusted by one line 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.590
 whose position can be moved for 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.810
 us option with joysticks
