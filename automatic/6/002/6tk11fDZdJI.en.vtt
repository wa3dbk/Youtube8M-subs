00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.250
 the big problem when the computer 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.710
 spoils just what 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.740
 That's why this video is going to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 go through several steps until you discover and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 solve the problem 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.080
 to perform this battery of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 diagnostics, it is necessary to use the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 cd houngbo program you should do the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.609
 download on the bajaki of recording the content 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.019
 on a disk 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.500
 click the option related to your 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.500
 problem 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.239
 you can be sure that the computer 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.469
 is spoiled when he does not even give 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.970
 sign of life 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.950
 in this type of situation follow these steps 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 although it seems silly we recommend that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.479
 you take a look if the cable is 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.450
 plug is also worth checking 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.240
 if the stabilizer filter is on 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.759
 then see if the source key is in the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.210
 on and if it is set 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.759
 correct voltage will be required 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.759
 open the cabinet so take the key 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.770
 remove the cover 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.050
 if your motherboard has a power led 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.810
 make sure it is lit 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.850
 Now check whether the internal cable 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.960
 are properly connected to the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.330
 motherboard 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.319
 consult the manual to find out the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.750
 positioning them correctly 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.369
 check that the memories are properly 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.619
 embedded to end doubts 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.879
 remove the modules and replace the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.759
 check yourself out after a power outage 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:04.720
 no component was burned observing 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.729
 there's no scorching in any of them 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.950
 if you have cards attached to the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.860
 lots to remove them to verify 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.980
 none is defect disconnect hd 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.959
 and dvd drive 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.390
 if your motherboard supports boot 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.110
 memory modules try to connect the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 PraÃ§a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.560
 nothing ran the problem possibly 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 is in the cpu at the source or on the card itself 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.500
 mom 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.599
 it is good to remember that sources with protection 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.230
 do not allow you to turn on the computer when 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.360
 something is short-circuited these goods 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.430
 tips have not helped you 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.430
 seek help from a trained technician 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.620
 there are ways to identify which component 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.700
 it's messing up just by hearing the whistle 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.560
 motherboard 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 see how you can identify the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.190
 problem 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.280
 first check the motherboard manual 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.780
 to know what the noise means 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.630
 interval habits may indicate 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 memory problems an extended whistle 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.910
 may suggest some problem with energy 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.990
 after knowing what is faulty 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.790
 open the case, make sure everything is 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.980
 properly docked 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.730
 if possible remove component 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 and try to power the machine many times. 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.300
 times removing the components does not solve 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.489
 the problem 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.120
 we recommend that you use a brush to 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.310
 carry out a lot cleaning 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:46.480
 in the case of memories try to pass a 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:48.850
 rubber in the contacts when the system 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.769
 freezes you can follow some steps 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.620
 to identify the problem 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.390
 the first hear the hd noise if 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.730
 there is some bizarre noise 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.780
 necessary to do a hd test outside the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.790
 system 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.340
 even if you do not hear different sounds 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.620
 worth a test to find out if there is 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:12.190
 presence of black blocks, insert the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.410
 hard bodies and use hard disk sentinel 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.600
 to check the temperature information 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.419
 on the health of the device 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.110
 the temperature is ok so it's time to 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.150
 run the test application 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.840
 if your hd is following the maxthon 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.729

 in the main menu of the right boots and 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.300
 April of the programs 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.280
 wait and load the radio option 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.919
 skills check that there is no 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.490
 software for your disk there are options for 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.510
 samsung digital west and bm toshiba and 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.570
 fujitsu 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.640
 there is also a universal tool in the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.500
 program menu, choose the item one

 and chose hd you want to check use the 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.430
 option jorge takes the test menu check 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.150
 rpet setters the check time 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.280
 varies according to hd capacity none 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.199
 problem found to verify 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.270
 problems in the system we recommend that 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.580
 you use the original windows disk and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.009
 run the recovery tool 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.020
 If nothing succeeds try making a 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.729
 backup your data to another HD and 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.419
 format the partition that appears to be 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.419
 damaged 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.650
 other errors can be verified 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.110
 when windows presents the famous screen 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.820
 blue of death see what to do for 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.250
 solve the problem 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.270
 check the cpu temperature on bios 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.610
 motherboard 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.979
 navigate at least to find such 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.320
 detail compare with the maximum value 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.110
 reported by the manufacturer 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.289
 if you do not find use right boots and 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.000
 April the item of select programs 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:03.620
 system future and open hw info 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.110
 when the software loads, click 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.419
 menu and press enter on your 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.380
 check that the temperature is not 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.860
 it's high 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.330
 the processor is okay so let's 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.210
 analyze the memory 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.330
 open the same test 86 in the right menu 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.330
 boots and from now on you can have a coffee 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.539
 after the test takes too long if you have 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.270
 more than four gigs wait sit 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.909
 If you find any errors in a list with 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.009
 items in red color should appear 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.870
 if the modules are in perfect condition 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:40.009
 state the program will display the message 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:43.280
 fishing platinum errors no problem with 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.529
 then open the case and remove the 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.319
 the additional boards 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.899
 if the pc is connecting everything indicates that 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.849
 none is short circuit therefore 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.549
 you can remove each one separately 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.639
 to find out which one is with 

00:06:55.549 --> 00:07:00.109
 problem removed all signs and 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.419
 problem persists 

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:03.169
 the error may be on the chipset of the card 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.749
 mom 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.789
 in this case try to update the drivers 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:11.389
 downloading the latest version of the site 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:13.699
 manufacturer has not resolved, check 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.079
 other drivers are up to date and 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.929
 some recently installed program 

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:21.289
 did not cause the blue screen problem 

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:23.799
 if no solution had any effect 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:26.599
 formatting is required 

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:30.999
 if you format does not get good 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:30.999
