00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.240 
evolved into a nonprofit organization
it's<00:02:55.780> been<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> joint<00:02:56.440> effort<00:02:56.620> between<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
it's been a joint effort between the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.100 
it's been a joint effort between the
townspeople<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.739> kids<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.630> board

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.559 
townspeople the the kids and the board
members<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:03.850> reality

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
members to to really make this reality

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.900 
members to to really make this reality
so<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.319> slow<00:03:05.590> sometimes<00:03:06.040> painful<00:03:06.730> process

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
so it's a slow sometimes painful process

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.690 
so it's a slow sometimes painful process
but<00:03:07.440> we've<00:03:08.440> got<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> lot<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.860> very<00:03:09.100> good<00:03:09.160> energy

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
but we've got a lot of very good energy

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.500 
but we've got a lot of very good energy
behind<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:12.100> we<00:03:12.670> may<00:03:12.819> be<00:03:12.850> sitting

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
behind it and I think we may be sitting

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.559 
behind it and I think we may be sitting
a<00:03:13.600> park<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.560> not-too-distant<00:03:15.040> future
