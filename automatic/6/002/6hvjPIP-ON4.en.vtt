rank and position in the game now what

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
rank and position in the game now what
these<00:00:36.989> probably<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.710> mean<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.460> will

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
these probably will mean is that it will

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
these probably will mean is that it will
be<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.910> changes<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.899> high<00:00:40.050> scores

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
be some changes to do is get high scores

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
be some changes to do is get high scores
I'm<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.739> sure<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.149> free-to-play

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I'm not really sure how the free-to-play

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
I'm not really sure how the free-to-play
players<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> shown<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
players will be kind of shown on the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
players will be kind of shown on the
high<00:00:44.579> scores<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.239> guess<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
high scores but my guess is that to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.440 
high scores but my guess is that to
either<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.980> their<00:00:47.129> new<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.090> guess

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
either have their new kind of I guess

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.319 
either have their new kind of I guess
either<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.649> new<00:00:49.920> section<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> old<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
either a new section to the old kind of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
either a new section to the old kind of
self<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> few<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.829> probably

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
self just a few of them will probably

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.369 
self just a few of them will probably
added<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> imagine<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.390> only<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
added like I can imagine that only the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.479 
added like I can imagine that only the
ones<00:00:55.620> who<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> certain<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> mother

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
ones who like certain the mother

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
ones who like certain the mother
experian<00:00:57.180> amount<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> levels<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
experian amount of levels or like a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
experian amount of levels or like a
certain<00:00:58.949> time<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.190> activity<00:00:59.760> would<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.449> shown

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
certain time of activity would be shown

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
certain time of activity would be shown
on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> high<00:01:01.199> score<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.649> example<00:01:02.070> let's<00:01:02.100> say

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
on the high score for example let's say

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
on the high score for example let's say
that<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:03.059> free<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> play<00:01:03.660> players<00:01:03.930> I've<00:01:04.229> been

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that only free to play players I've been

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
that only free to play players I've been
logged<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.400> last<00:01:05.670> three<00:01:06.210> months<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
logged in the last three months will be

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
logged in the last three months will be
able<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.740> shown<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> high<00:01:08.340> scores<00:01:08.700> and

able to be shown on the high scores and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.429 
able to be shown on the high scores and
from<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> would<00:01:09.869> probably<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.229> like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
from that if it would probably be like

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
from that if it would probably be like
like<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.159> before<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> top<00:01:12.689> two

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
like that I do be fair that's something

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
like that I do be fair that's something
that<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.820> quite<00:01:18.090> realistic<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that I can see be quite realistic and I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.120 
that I can see be quite realistic and I
wouldn't<00:01:19.080> mind<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.070> happy

wouldn't mind that I'm just really happy
that<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> play<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.630> have

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that for you to play actually would have

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
that for you to play actually would have
their<00:01:21.930> spot<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.680> high<00:01:22.799> scores<00:01:23.130> after<00:01:23.400> this

their spot on the high scores after this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179 
their spot on the high scores after this
long<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> personally<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.710> it's

a realistic version of the high score is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
a realistic version of the high score is
how<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> would<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.240> today<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.290> i<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
how it would be today which i think is a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
how it would be today which i think is a
very<00:01:46.860> cool<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.670> able<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
very cool thing to be able to do and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.490 
very cool thing to be able to do and
hopefully<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.140> they're<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
hopefully that's how they're going to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
hopefully that's how they're going to
kind<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.189> work<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.119> guess<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> do

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
kind of work it out I guess because I do

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.120 
kind of work it out I guess because I do
think<00:01:52.380> they're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:52.950> bit

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
think they're going to be a little bit

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
think they're going to be a little bit
sneak<00:01:53.310> about<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.909> some<00:01:54.149> drinking

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
sneak about it and do some drinking

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
sneak about it and do some drinking

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
enough of high scores but to be fair

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.730 
enough of high scores but to be fair
free-to-play<00:02:26.570> contains<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.200> lot<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.410> players

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
free-to-play contains a lot of players

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740 
free-to-play contains a lot of players
that<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.430> purely<00:02:28.760> focus<00:02:29.210> are<00:02:29.330> free<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.630> play

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
that is purely focus are free to play

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
that is purely focus are free to play
the<00:02:29.990> camp<00:02:30.230> necessarily<00:02:30.770> pay<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> game

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the camp necessarily pay for the game

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.090 
the camp necessarily pay for the game
and<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:32.420> think<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.900> they<00:02:33.050> should<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.470> this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
and I think that they should have this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.410 
and I think that they should have this
kind<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> veteran<00:02:34.670> play<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.030> should<00:02:35.240> have

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
kind of veteran play we should have

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.210 
kind of veteran play we should have
their<00:02:35.600> own<00:02:35.630> spot<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> high<00:02:36.740> scores<00:02:37.100> to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
their own spot in the high scores to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.980 
their own spot in the high scores to
this<00:02:37.370> serves<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.730> kind<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.150> what<00:02:38.300> position

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
this serves to kind of see what position

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.710 
this serves to kind of see what position
