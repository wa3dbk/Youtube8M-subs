00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:11.410
 Front brake town of electric scooters for v brakes used in normal bicycles 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:17.220
 I am using 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:25.090
 This kind of rolled bark is not frozen when he tumbled down the brake pads names 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:31.330
 If there is an interventional brake pad command interference, adjust the tension on that wire 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:34.329
 And when you press the brake, both sides do not move equally and only one side 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.790
 If you say that you move fast 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.030
 If you can see me here 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:45.739
 This looks like a cross bolt bolts Le 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.230
 If you adjust the pole line, both sides will have the same tension 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.230
 Can be adjusted to move 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.930
 First, the pad surface 2 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.410
 If the wheel does not match 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.780
 Please use a 5mm hex hexagon 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:13.420
 Untie the u area and align the pads . 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.830
 Please re-tightened'm going to be caught in a tight brake status 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:23.380
 And as I said before , 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:29.979
 When you hold the brake, only one side 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.990
 Now, who now seems that I have a little more work side this side Dwell 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.880
 To do so, you can adjust the tension on this side , 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.390
 You can do it. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 Bolt 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 If you tighten 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:55.850
 This side is moving a lot more. 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:02:00.530
 I give this one is tightened the two devices in this spring 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.910
 It's something that allows me to expand this circle further . 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 How the explanation is 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:12.210
 No need Lap one trillion days, like so much what the range is the same on both sides 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.080
 You can set it to move. 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:22.200
 And the sensitivity is not good when the brake is applied 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.250
 That is, if you hold the brake firmly, 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 earlier 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.600
 Ah 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 Using the ome du value ng 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.349
 Fully loosen the bolts and then gently glue the wire to a length of 1 cm or less 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:44.709
 If you can adjust 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:47.190
 How did so giving to leave so, remove the wire tightened in this state 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.190
 You give it. 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:59.540
 So it's about simple maintenance, because it's the same parts as the bike. 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.540
 I think you'd better get help from a friend or shop who knows your bike. 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:25.410
 It looks like you're looking at the back. I'm using disk brakes. 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:28.590
 Yogeo has the advantage of better equipped than my colleagues on the front, but 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.460
 There is a little difficulty in management 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.460
 When invoked viewed 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:46.760
 There should be no sense of friction with pads like now, but some products 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.620
 If you look back, you will have a mechanical voice 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.950
 I can. 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.950
 That's 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.460
 This disk plate , called a rotor, 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.460
 View Now 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.250
 Move in the space that is visible here and cause friction with pads 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.520
 It's because of that. 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.520
 To control it and make it sound 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:22.120
 I got a degree in composition requirements 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:26.020
 I gotta move you look at the bolts are fastened to both sides and 5mm 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:31.710
 Old will have to be processed in this another hex bolts 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.710
 Using a 5mm hex-old to see the lines on the face side 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:46.020
 2 Call the frame a little and adjust the position. 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.020
 And another use hot 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:55.640
 How do you get inside as you use it 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:05:01.990
 There's a lot of discs on one side . Inside. 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.990
 Reply to this side is there is a half to adjust That 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:11.400
 After you have unlocked two bolts here without a 5mm ball , 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.930
 Using a 2.5 and a 2- wrench 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.190
 He decided that 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.190
 You give it a little bit today. 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:33.460
 And again it ohmil know or get the hex ppaenjji 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:38.080
 You can move the pad forward . 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.090
 I do not need to pay too much'm out of the rough and just over the next yijeongdo 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.199
 If you are present , 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.810
 If you move beyond this, there is no interference with your use 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:53.419
 And because it is late 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:58.820
 If you keep using it without adjusting it, 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:06:04.880
 Get all the iron load 9 dwaeseo deonga smells diverge sound 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:11.169
 And there could be a problem with braking or not. 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.169
 Do you see this wire in the back as well? 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.010
 312 I'm old part of the city administration and I Wire 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.669
 Fuller has a bolt on the back 3 to give even if you adjust the length of Ayer 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.050
 Brake sensitivity can be adjusted 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:40.580
 This is also commonly used for bicycles and bicycles 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:43.270
 Bout the break contact because the bike or bike shop colleague know 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.270
 Sounds good.
