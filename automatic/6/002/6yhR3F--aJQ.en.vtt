welcome<00:00:00.719> back<00:00:00.900> in<00:00:01.199> our<00:00:01.380> last<00:00:01.589> session<00:00:01.890> we

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
welcome back in our last session we

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.120 
welcome back in our last session we
talked<00:00:02.399> about<00:00:02.520> op<00:00:02.879> art<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.449> we<00:00:03.600> finished

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
talked about op art and we finished

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.920 
talked about op art and we finished
using<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.190> sharpie<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.670> create<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.390> op<00:00:06.660> art

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
using a sharpie to create this op art

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.839 
using a sharpie to create this op art
image<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.470> all<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.740> lines<00:00:07.980> kind<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.580> running

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
image with all the lines kind of running

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.790 
image with all the lines kind of running
into<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.210> center<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.110> talked<00:00:10.349> about<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
into the center and we talked about the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.490 
into the center and we talked about the
curvature<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.910> line<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.960> way<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
curvature of the line going one way and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200 
curvature of the line going one way and
the<00:00:13.889> second<00:00:14.309> one<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.000> other<00:00:15.030> way

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
the second one going the other way

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.830 
the second one going the other way
creating<00:00:15.900> repetition<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.490> gives<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.270> art

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
creating repetition is what gives up art

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.500 
creating repetition is what gives up art
the<00:00:19.080> illusion<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:21.350> Whig<00:00:22.350> leanness<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the illusion of Whig leanness to it in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
the illusion of Whig leanness to it in
this<00:00:24.750> session<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.289> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> color<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.400> our

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this session we're going to color in our

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.650 
this session we're going to color in our
op<00:00:27.029> art<00:00:27.740> work<00:00:28.740> okay<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> started<00:00:30.060> coloring<00:00:30.300> mine

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
op art work okay I started coloring mine

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
op art work okay I started coloring mine
to<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.140> give<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> feel<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to kind of give you the feel of what it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.670 
to kind of give you the feel of what it
will<00:00:32.669> look<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> end<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.380> things

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
will look like at the end but two things

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
will look like at the end but two things
that<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> talk<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that we want to talk about one is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
that we want to talk about one is
pattern<00:00:37.590> pattern<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> repeating<00:00:38.610> something

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
pattern pattern is repeating something

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.250 
pattern pattern is repeating something
in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> same<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:41.760> over<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in the same way to go over and over and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
in the same way to go over and over and
over<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> over<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.160> something<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> same

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
over and over and do something the same

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000 
over and over and do something the same
way<00:00:45.090> each<00:00:45.239> time<00:00:45.270> we'll<00:00:45.780> create<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.170> pattern<00:00:46.440> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
way each time we'll create a pattern so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
way each time we'll create a pattern so
here<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> pattern<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.969> triangles<00:00:48.570> here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
here we have a pattern of triangles here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
here we have a pattern of triangles here
we<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:48.960> triangle<00:00:49.469> circle<00:00:49.829> triangle<00:00:50.370> circle

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
we have triangle circle triangle circle

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
we have triangle circle triangle circle
and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.230> color<00:00:52.500> blue

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and then here we just have color blue

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.760 
and then here we just have color blue
red<00:00:53.520> blue<00:00:53.940> red<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.620> I've

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
red blue red so you can see here I've

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670 
red blue red so you can see here I've
created<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.660> combination<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.870> pattern<00:00:58.410> color

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
created a combination of pattern color

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
created a combination of pattern color
here<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.309> here<00:01:00.059> I've<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
here and here I've kind of made that and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
here and here I've kind of made that and
I'm<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> create<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:02.010> pattern<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
I'm going to create a pattern all the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.600 
I'm going to create a pattern all the
way<00:01:02.969> around<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.719> Center<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
way around my Center but I also have a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
way around my Center but I also have a
pattern<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.360> orange<00:01:06.689> red<00:01:06.900> orange<00:01:07.290> red

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
pattern going on orange red orange red

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
pattern going on orange red orange red
orange<00:01:07.799> red<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> way<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> center<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
orange red all the way into the center I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899 
orange red all the way into the center I
also<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> second<00:01:10.799> pattern<00:01:11.070> here

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
also have then a second pattern here

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
also have then a second pattern here
going<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.080> into<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> center<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
going all the way into the center so you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
going all the way into the center so you
could<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.270> had<00:01:15.540> red<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.070> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
could think of this as I had red and I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910 
could think of this as I had red and I
had<00:01:17.250> orange<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.659> B<00:01:18.810> color<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> had<00:01:19.619> my

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
had orange a and B color and I had my

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
had orange a and B color and I had my
dark<00:01:20.640> blue<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.210> light<00:01:21.420> blue<00:01:21.659> being<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
dark blue in my light blue being my a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120 
dark blue in my light blue being my a
and<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.070> B<00:01:23.490> color<00:01:23.700> okay<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.560> those<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.070> two

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and my B color okay so those are my two

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
and my B color okay so those are my two
patterns<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> talk<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
patterns we're going to talk just a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
patterns we're going to talk just a
little<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.229> those<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.640> second

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
little bit more about those in a second

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.530 
little bit more about those in a second
but<00:01:30.210> next<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.880> drawing<00:01:33.210> here

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
but next you can see in my drawing here

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.190 
but next you can see in my drawing here
I've<00:01:33.689> used<00:01:33.720> value<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.950> shading<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.210> create<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I've used value or shading to create a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.340 
I've used value or shading to create a
even<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> curvature<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> piece

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
even more of a curvature to this piece

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280 
even more of a curvature to this piece
so<00:01:40.590> shading<00:01:41.369> value<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> lightness<00:01:42.540> or

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so shading value is the lightness or

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.800 
so shading value is the lightness or
darkness<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.159> area<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:44.700> object<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.479> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
darkness of an area or object so here in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.289 
darkness of an area or object so here in
this<00:01:45.899> little<00:01:46.200> picture<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> drew<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this little picture I drew you know the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
this little picture I drew you know the
darkest<00:01:48.720> part<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> circle<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.340> the

so<00:02:10.990> as<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:11.920> start<00:02:12.220> coloring<00:02:12.730> you're<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:13.060> to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so as we start coloring you're going to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.910 
so as we start coloring you're going to
choose<00:02:13.510> two<00:02:13.960> colors<00:02:14.170> I'm<00:02:14.500> going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.680> start

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
choose two colors I'm going to start

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.710 
choose two colors I'm going to start
with<00:02:14.980> my<00:02:15.160> blue<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.430> my<00:02:15.790> my<00:02:16.210> light<00:02:16.360> blue<00:02:16.570> my

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
with my blue and my my light blue my

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
with my blue and my my light blue my
dark<00:02:16.990> blue<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.980> color<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
dark blue here so that we can color in

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.060 
dark blue here so that we can color in
this<00:02:22.210> next<00:02:22.810> piece<00:02:23.050> over<00:02:23.380> since<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:23.770> going

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
this next piece over since I'm going

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.690 
this next piece over since I'm going
along<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.990> idea<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.380> pattern<00:02:26.980> alright

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
along with the idea of pattern alright

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.510 
along with the idea of pattern alright
so<00:02:28.000> first<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:29.140> can<00:02:29.290> see<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> use<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.190> dark

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
so first you can see I use this dark

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.940 
so first you can see I use this dark
bluish<00:02:31.210> violet<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.560> going<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.740> take

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
bluish violet there so I'm going to take

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.120 
bluish violet there so I'm going to take
that<00:02:33.190> I'm<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> write<00:02:34.060> an<00:02:34.210> A<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that I'm just going to write an A and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.090 
that I'm just going to write an A and
then<00:02:36.130> I'm<00:02:36.310> going<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.550> write<00:02:36.840> B<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.980> I'm

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
then I'm going to write B a a and I'm

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.710 
then I'm going to write B a a and I'm
going<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> skip<00:02:42.610> one<00:02:42.790> each<00:02:42.940> time<00:02:43.210> since<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.660> know

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
going to skip one each time since I know

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.950 
going to skip one each time since I know
that<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.470> my<00:02:45.340> pattern<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.940> here's<00:02:46.240> my<00:02:46.480> B

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
that that is my pattern and here's my B

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.180 
that that is my pattern and here's my B
color<00:02:47.160> D<00:02:48.160> color<00:02:48.580> B<00:02:49.470> B<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
to take my next one and I'm just going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.350 
to take my next one and I'm just going
to<00:02:56.440> do<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.740> same<00:02:56.950> thing<00:02:57.310> notice<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.150> started

B eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh and it will help you
to<00:03:11.440> write<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.890> down<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.690> as<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:15.630> color

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
to write this down so that as you color

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.990 
to write this down so that as you color
you<00:03:17.290> don't<00:03:17.470> kind<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:17.950> lose<00:03:18.160> track<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.670> where

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000

you don't kind of lose track of where
you<00:03:19.150> are<00:03:19.330> because<00:03:19.420> sometimes<00:03:19.840> as<00:03:19.989> you're

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you are because sometimes as you're

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.870 
you are because sometimes as you're
coloring<00:03:20.560> your<00:03:20.680> mind<00:03:20.890> tends<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.430> wander<00:03:21.610> and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
coloring your mind tends to wander and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.790 
coloring your mind tends to wander and
then<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.600> might<00:03:22.750> make<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:22.989> mistake<00:03:23.470> what<00:03:23.650> you

and<00:06:04.690> we're<00:06:04.840> giving<00:06:05.170> it<00:06:05.350> some<00:06:06.010> form<00:06:07.050> by<00:06:08.050> putting

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
and we're giving it some form by putting

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.420 
and we're giving it some form by putting
the<00:06:09.160> shading<00:06:09.580> in<00:06:09.760> so<00:06:09.940> it's<00:06:10.090> kind<00:06:10.330> of<00:06:10.450> turning

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
the shading in so it's kind of turning

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.100 
the shading in so it's kind of turning
three-dimensional<00:06:12.430> you<00:06:13.180> can<00:06:13.300> almost<00:06:13.480> if<00:06:13.900> you

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
three-dimensional you can almost if you

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.410 
three-dimensional you can almost if you
want<00:06:14.500> to<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.070> you<00:06:15.130> do<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:15.490> neatly<00:06:15.940> and

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
want to and you do it neatly and

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.660 
want to and you do it neatly and
thoughtfully<00:06:17.110> almost<00:06:17.440> leave<00:06:17.830> like<00:06:18.160> curved

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
thoughtfully almost leave like curved

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.800 
thoughtfully almost leave like curved
lines<00:06:19.350> in<00:06:20.350> here<00:06:20.680> like<00:06:20.890> cross<00:06:21.670> hatching<00:06:22.270> that

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
lines in here like cross hatching that

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.730 
lines in here like cross hatching that
are<00:06:22.960> going<00:06:23.200> to<00:06:23.320> curve<00:06:24.720> this<00:06:25.720> shape<00:06:26.230> even<00:06:26.500> more

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
are going to curve this shape even more

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.290 
are going to curve this shape even more
rather<00:06:26.920> than<00:06:27.040> coloring<00:06:27.610> back<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:28.030> forth

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
rather than coloring back and forth

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.130 
rather than coloring back and forth
horizontally<00:06:28.570> or<00:06:29.470> vertically<00:06:30.190> I'm<00:06:31.140> coloring

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
horizontally or vertically I'm coloring

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.070 
horizontally or vertically I'm coloring
on<00:06:32.500> a

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
on a

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.050 
on a
you<00:06:33.379> can<00:06:33.530> see<00:06:33.770> those<00:06:33.949> lines<00:06:34.250> in<00:06:34.610> there<00:06:34.789> that<00:06:35.030> I

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
you can see those lines in there that I

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.330 
you can see those lines in there that I
put<00:06:35.389> and<00:06:35.569> those<00:06:36.050> curves<00:06:36.560> are<00:06:36.830> actually<00:06:37.189> going

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
put and those curves are actually going

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.179 
put and those curves are actually going
to<00:06:37.430> help<00:06:37.909> to<00:06:38.659> trick<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.139> eye<00:06:39.169> even<00:06:39.319> more<00:06:39.860> if

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
to help to trick the eye even more if

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.779 
to help to trick the eye even more if
you<00:06:40.340> leave<00:06:40.610> those<00:06:40.970> in<00:06:41.030> ever<00:06:41.990> so<00:06:42.710> slightly<00:06:43.159> all

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
you leave those in ever so slightly all

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.080 
you leave those in ever so slightly all
right<00:06:44.110> so<00:06:45.110> what<00:06:45.319> you're<00:06:45.409> going<00:06:45.560> to<00:06:45.650> do<00:06:45.800> is<00:06:46.090> we

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
right so what you're going to do is we

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.429 
right so what you're going to do is we
don't<00:06:47.210> need<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:47.509> watch<00:06:47.659> me<00:06:47.930> color<00:06:48.139> the<00:06:48.349> whole

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439 
don't need to watch me color the whole

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.659 
don't need to watch me color the whole
thing<00:06:48.710> because<00:06:48.889> I<00:06:48.949> think<00:06:49.009> it's<00:06:49.250> going<00:06:49.370> to<00:06:49.430> take

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
thing because I think it's going to take

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.469 
thing because I think it's going to take
quite<00:06:49.909> a<00:06:50.659> while<00:06:50.990> so<00:06:51.949> you<00:06:51.979> can<00:06:52.370> get<00:06:52.610> started<00:06:53.270> on

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
quite a while so you can get started on

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.409 
quite a while so you can get started on
the<00:06:53.659> coloring<00:06:54.469> and<00:06:54.669> just<00:06:55.669> make<00:06:55.909> sure<00:06:56.120> that<00:06:56.150> you

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
the coloring and just make sure that you

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.070 
the coloring and just make sure that you
keep<00:06:56.629> a<00:06:56.810> consistent<00:06:57.469> pattern<00:06:58.539> with<00:06:59.539> like<00:06:59.719> warm

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
keep a consistent pattern with like warm

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.850 
keep a consistent pattern with like warm
colors<00:07:00.590> cool<00:07:01.129> warm<00:07:01.759> cool<00:07:02.210> warm<00:07:02.930> cool<00:07:03.409> warm

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
cool all the way around and then make

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.930 
cool all the way around and then make
sure<00:07:07.580> that<00:07:07.909> you<00:07:08.030> keep<00:07:08.690> consistent<00:07:09.259> with

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
sure that you keep consistent with

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.820 
sure that you keep consistent with
aba-ba-ba<00:07:10.940> B<00:07:11.300> so<00:07:11.750> that<00:07:11.930> by<00:07:12.080> the<00:07:12.139> end<00:07:12.440> it<00:07:12.740> will

aba-ba-ba B so that by the end it will
really<00:07:13.159> pop<00:07:13.370> and<00:07:13.610> in<00:07:13.990> class<00:07:14.990> I'll<00:07:15.319> have<00:07:15.620> my

really pop and in class I'll have my

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.939 
really pop and in class I'll have my

demonstration hanging up and that is how

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.050 
demonstration hanging up and that is how
you<00:07:19.340> finish<00:07:19.699> and<00:07:20.199> shade<00:07:21.199> your<00:07:21.889> op<00:07:22.219> art<00:07:22.580> picture

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
you finish and shade your op art picture

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.189 
you finish and shade your op art picture
creating<00:07:24.050> patterns<00:07:24.860> and<00:07:25.490> using<00:07:26.389> value<00:07:26.960> and
