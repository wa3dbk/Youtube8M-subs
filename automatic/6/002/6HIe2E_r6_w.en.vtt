00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
change a lot but I thought I would make
a<00:01:04.470> video<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.979> showing<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.580> glasses

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a video just showing off these glasses

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.780 
a video just showing off these glasses
they<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> same<00:01:07.010> lenses<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.510> far<00:01:09.510> as<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
they have the same lenses as far as a

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.859 
they have the same lenses as far as a
transition<00:01:11.790> Extro<00:01:12.720> active<00:01:14.479> then<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> had<00:01:15.659> last

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
transition Extro active then I had last

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.120 
transition Extro active then I had last
time<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.360> my<00:01:18.360> uncle<00:01:18.920> who<00:01:19.920> lives

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
time and I like that my uncle who lives

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
time and I like that my uncle who lives
in<00:01:20.250> Pennsylvania<00:01:20.820> he<00:01:21.450> didn't<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.020> them

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
in Pennsylvania he didn't like them

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
in Pennsylvania he didn't like them
because<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:23.630> transitions<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:24.780> work<00:01:24.930> well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
because they transitions don't work well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
because they transitions don't work well
in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> heat<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> first<00:01:26.939> time

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in the heat so this is the first time

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
in the heat so this is the first time
they'll<00:01:27.420> being<00:01:27.600> activated<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.740> probably

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
they'll being activated it's probably

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
they'll being activated it's probably
like<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> radio<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.810> says<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
like I think on the radio they says it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.310 
like I think on the radio they says it's
98<00:01:31.439> degrees<00:01:31.770> today<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.270> Florida<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:35.000> I

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
98 degrees today here in Florida and I

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.569 
98 degrees today here in Florida and I
think<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> feels<00:01:37.619> over<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> hundred<00:01:38.490> degrees

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
think it feels over a hundred degrees

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.480 
think it feels over a hundred degrees
from<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.840> were<00:01:39.900> saying<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.999 

transitions<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.700> work<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> heat

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
transitions don't work well in the heat

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
transitions don't work well in the heat
so<00:01:47.119> like<00:01:48.119> these<00:01:48.270> aren't<00:01:48.540> working<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:49.200> all

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so like these aren't working well at all

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.090 
so like these aren't working well at all
because<00:01:49.799> they're<00:01:50.130> brand<00:01:50.490> new<00:01:50.570> transitions

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
because they're brand new transitions

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.580 
because they're brand new transitions
but<00:01:53.100> no<00:01:53.369> they'll<00:01:54.299> work<00:01:54.509> better<00:01:54.540> than<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.079> but

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
but no they'll work better than this but

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.249 
but no they'll work better than this but
they<00:01:55.710> still<00:01:55.950> won't<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.250> super<00:01:56.670> dark<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.869> uncle

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
they still won't get super dark my uncle

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.440 
they still won't get super dark my uncle
in<00:01:58.590> Pennsylvania<00:01:59.250> didn't<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.329> his

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
in Pennsylvania didn't like his

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
in Pennsylvania didn't like his
transitions<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.200> rid<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.860> they

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
transitions got rid of them because they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.660 
transitions got rid of them because they
got<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.310> dark<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:02.909> he<00:02:03.000> went<00:02:03.210> into<00:02:04.670> like

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
got so dark that when he went into like

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510 
got so dark that when he went into like
went<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> house<00:02:06.380> or<00:02:07.380> inside<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.369> would

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
went into the house or inside they would

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.020 
went into the house or inside they would
stay<00:02:08.759> dark<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.679> five<00:02:10.679> eight<00:02:11.069> ten<00:02:11.580> minutes

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.170 
scale which I think I'm either 11 or 12
steps<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.210> diopter<00:03:16.660> scale<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:19.290> negative

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
steps in the diopter scale or negative

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.540 
steps in the diopter scale or negative
diopter<00:03:22.180> scale<00:03:22.420> because<00:03:22.810> I'm<00:03:23.050> nearsighted<00:03:24.010> so

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
diopter scale because I'm nearsighted so

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.410 
diopter scale because I'm nearsighted so
