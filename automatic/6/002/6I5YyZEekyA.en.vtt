then when you're ready to shoot the ball
all<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.100> need<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.670> hit<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.269> yellow

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
all you need to do is hit the yellow

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.759 
all you need to do is hit the yellow
circle<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.910> there's<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.050> meter<00:02:31.320> for<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
circle and there's your meter for the

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.220 
circle and there's your meter for the
power<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.060> bring<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.510> down<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.110> was

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
power so you bring it down and that was

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.220 
power so you bring it down and that was
perfect<00:02:37.650> accuracy<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.230> 252

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
perfect accuracy so I get that one 252

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:56.120 
perfect accuracy so I get that one 252
yards<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:50.810> 363<00:02:51.810> yards<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> hole<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
yards and it's 363 yards to the hole so

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.690 
yards and it's 363 yards to the hole so
what<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:58.220> try<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.250> estimate

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
what you have to do is try and estimate

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:17.520 
what you have to do is try and estimate
where<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> hit<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.380> ball

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.470 

so<00:03:18.130> I'm<00:03:18.340> gonna<00:03:18.520> hit<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.760> right<00:03:18.970> there<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:22.270> now

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
so I'm gonna hit it right there so now

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.070 
so I'm gonna hit it right there so now
you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.990> step<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.770> ball<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.959> was

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
you can step up to the ball and that was

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.440 
you can step up to the ball and that was
perfect<00:03:29.440> accuracy<00:03:30.040> again<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.270> wasn't

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
perfect accuracy again and that wasn't

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:48.150 
perfect accuracy again and that wasn't
too<00:03:37.690> bad<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.640> now<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.390> putt<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.980> can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
too bad so now to do a putt you can

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.100 
too bad so now to do a putt you can
actually<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:50.110> pattern<00:03:51.570> at<00:03:52.570> where<00:03:52.930> you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
actually see the pattern at where you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.910 
actually see the pattern at where you
want<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.410> hit<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.769> ball

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.440 

so<00:04:03.830> I'm<00:04:04.830> going<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.430> just<00:04:05.660> give<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:08.360> just<00:04:09.360> a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
so I'm going to just give it just a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.300 
so I'm going to just give it just a
little<00:04:09.480> over<00:04:09.900> twenty<00:04:10.230> five<00:04:10.440> percent<00:04:10.470> power

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
little over twenty five percent power
