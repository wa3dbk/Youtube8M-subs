00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.250 

I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:40.090> for<00:00:40.270> me<00:00:40.420> what<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:40.629> really<00:00:40.989> enjoy<00:00:41.020> about

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
I think for me what I really enjoy about

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.680 
I think for me what I really enjoy about
dirt<00:00:41.829> compare<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.399> tarmac<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.120> just<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.420> fact

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
dirt compare the tarmac is just the fact

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.110 
dirt compare the tarmac is just the fact
that<00:00:43.840> there's<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:44.890> many<00:00:44.980> different<00:00:45.309> ways<00:00:45.730> to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
that there's so many different ways to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.939 
that there's so many different ways to
get<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.480> corner<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.140> there's<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:47.829> many

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
get to a corner and there's so many

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.100 
get to a corner and there's so many
different<00:00:48.219> traction<00:00:48.820> levels<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.600> just<00:00:49.899> makes

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
different traction levels it just makes

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.790 
different traction levels it just makes
it<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.500> more<00:00:50.769> dynamic<00:00:51.129> surface<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.210> race<00:00:52.449> on

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it a more dynamic surface to race on

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.189 
it a more dynamic surface to race on
because<00:00:53.800> there's<00:00:54.640> different<00:00:55.120> ways<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.659> break

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
because there's different ways to break

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.040 
because there's different ways to break
and<00:00:56.949> power<00:00:57.220> through<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.640> corner<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.269> exit

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
and power through the corner and exit

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.960 
and power through the corner and exit
the<00:00:59.079> corner<00:00:59.589> it<00:01:00.040> just<00:01:00.280> gives<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.610> more<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.850> a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the corner it just gives you more of a

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.060 
the corner it just gives you more of a
variety<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.600> ways<00:01:01.930> to<00:01:01.989> play<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.589> game<00:01:02.800> and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
variety of ways to play the game and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:19.389 
variety of ways to play the game and
that's<00:01:03.220> what<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.489> really<00:01:03.850> enjoy

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.679 

well<00:01:20.399> some<00:01:20.579> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> stage<00:01:20.969> is<00:01:21.149> in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
well some of the stage is in there to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.749 
well some of the stage is in there to
have<00:01:22.280> mixed<00:01:23.280> surfaces<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:26.039> know<00:01:26.159> such<00:01:26.460> as<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
have mixed surfaces you know such as the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.200 
have mixed surfaces you know such as the
Battersea<00:01:27.299> stage<00:01:28.200> where<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.159> jump<00:01:29.789> in<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Battersea stage where you jump in and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
Battersea stage where you jump in and
out<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:31.409> building<00:01:31.590> itself<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.520> once<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
out of the building itself and once you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.969 
out of the building itself and once you
get<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.539> there's<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:33.990> tarmac<00:01:34.380> areas<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
get out there's some tarmac areas and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.289 
get out there's some tarmac areas and
there's<00:01:35.159> some<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.520> areas<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> there's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there's some good areas and there's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
there's some good areas and there's
jumps<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> notice<00:01:38.819> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
jumps and you really got a notice the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.419 
jumps and you really got a notice the
ground<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> dirts<00:01:40.649> on<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
ground that the dirts on because the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.580 
ground that the dirts on because the
traction<00:01:42.030> varies<00:01:42.599> according<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.289> surface

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
traction varies according to the surface

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
traction varies according to the surface
so<00:01:44.369> there's<00:01:44.549> areas<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> car<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so there's areas where the car will have

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.440 
so there's areas where the car will have
a<00:01:46.020> better<00:01:46.439> grip<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.099> once<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> tarmac

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
a better grip and once in the tarmac

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
a better grip and once in the tarmac
areas<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.590> also<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.159> other<00:01:50.369> areas

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
areas and then also this other areas

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
areas and then also this other areas
where<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> car<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.629> slide<00:01:51.929> more<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
where the car will just slide more I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.080 
where the car will just slide more I
think<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.039> amazing<00:01:53.459> there's<00:01:53.670> definitely

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
think that's amazing there's definitely

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
think that's amazing there's definitely
some<00:01:54.299> stages<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:54.989> have<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.319> in<00:01:55.379> America

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
some stages that we have here in America

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.830 
some stages that we have here in America
where<00:01:56.129> you<00:01:56.819> know<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> mix<00:01:57.569> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
where you know you're on the mix of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
where you know you're on the mix of
tarmac<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> changes<00:01:59.759> over<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
tarmac and then the changes over the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
tarmac and then the changes over the
dirt<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.629> you<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.140> able<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.349> identify

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
dirt and you have to be able to identify

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.520 
dirt and you have to be able to identify
those<00:02:02.129> areas<00:02:02.209> obviously<00:02:03.209> with<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:03.989> eyes<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
those areas obviously with your eyes and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.229 
those areas obviously with your eyes and
adjust<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:04.979> driving<00:02:05.399> style<00:02:05.489> according<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
adjust your driving style according to

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.089 
adjust your driving style according to
the<00:02:06.329> Circle<00:02:06.719> C<00:02:06.750> you're<00:02:06.989> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.649> same<00:02:07.829> thing

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the Circle C you're on the same thing

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:23.690 
the Circle C you're on the same thing
here

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.830 

let's<00:02:23.879> try<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.330> thank<00:02:24.930> God

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.710 

there's<00:02:28.840> always<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> fine<00:02:29.680> balance<00:02:29.980> between

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
there's always a fine balance between

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.479 
there's always a fine balance between
too<00:02:31.720> much<00:02:31.900> steering<00:02:32.349> input<00:02:32.709> or<00:02:32.860> too<00:02:33.010> much<00:02:33.159> gas

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
too much steering input or too much gas

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.729 
too much steering input or too much gas
too<00:02:33.849> much<00:02:34.030> great<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.689> really<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.500> get<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
too much great and really to get the

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.229 
too much great and really to get the
best<00:02:35.860> time<00:02:36.189> on<00:02:36.400> some<00:02:36.579> of<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.730> courses<00:02:37.000> you

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
best time on some of the courses you

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.809 
best time on some of the courses you
really<00:02:37.599> have<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.950> commit<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.129> try<00:02:39.310> as<00:02:39.489> hard<00:02:39.670> as

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
really have to commit and try as hard as

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.059 
really have to commit and try as hard as
you<00:02:39.939> can<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.590> occasionally<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.739> will<00:02:41.860> put

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
you can and occasionally that will put

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.940 
you can and occasionally that will put
you<00:02:42.159> off<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.310> road<00:02:42.510> yeah<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.530> that's<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
you off the road yeah but that's you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.259 
you off the road yeah but that's you
know<00:02:45.040> part<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.549> farming<00:02:45.970> part<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
know part of the farming part of the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.929 
know part of the farming part of the
challenge<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.780> really<00:02:46.900> figuring<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.939> the

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
challenge is really figuring out the

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.520 
challenge is really figuring out the
sensitivity<00:02:49.689> of<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> controller<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
sensitivity of the controller the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.860 
sensitivity of the controller the
sensitivity<00:02:51.189> of<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> car<00:02:51.579> how<00:02:52.390> much<00:02:52.540> feedback

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
sensitivity of the car how much feedback

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.229 
sensitivity of the car how much feedback
you<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.590> get<00:02:53.890> from<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.370> car<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.909> way<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
you really get from the car the way that
