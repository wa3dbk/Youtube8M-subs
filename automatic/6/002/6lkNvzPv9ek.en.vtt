00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.980 

and<00:05:04.790> now<00:05:05.790> we'll<00:05:06.000> move<00:05:06.120> on<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.540> sides<00:05:08.990> so

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
Destiny's hair is pretty fine so I don't

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.720

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
think she needs both I'll just do one on

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.660 
think she needs both I'll just do one on
each<00:05:17.880> side<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.950> for<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.070> girls<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.520> have

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
thicker hair then you would probably

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.310
