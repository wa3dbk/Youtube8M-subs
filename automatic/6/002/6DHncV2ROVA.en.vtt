00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
heater blower motor was working but

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.480 
heater blower motor was working but
certainly<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.360> heater<00:03:43.510> itself<00:03:44.430> seems<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
certainly the the heater itself seems to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.310 
certainly the the heater itself seems to
do<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.700> job<00:03:45.970> obviously<00:03:46.810> not<00:03:46.900> possible<00:03:47.260> to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
do the job obviously not possible to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.810 
do the job obviously not possible to
tell<00:03:47.530> test<00:03:47.890> if<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.070> air<00:03:48.190> conditioning<00:03:48.610> works

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820

button lights up and things without the
blower<00:03:54.550> motor<00:03:54.790> working<00:03:55.270> it's<00:03:56.080> impossible<00:03:56.500> to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
blower motor working it's impossible to
