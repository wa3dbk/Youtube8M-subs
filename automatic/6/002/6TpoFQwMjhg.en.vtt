00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.400
 hello dear hungry today video 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 it is not about a whole court 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 but the preparation of a ingredient and 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.640
 this, in turn, is in some ways 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.380
 also requirement for tomorrow's video 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 because then there is an Indian soup 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.640
 to detoxify and lose weight 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 Today we want to make the production as it is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.590
 clarified butter so comparable to 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.760
 Butterschmalz only high quality 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.250
 high quality in health food stores 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.739
 You can also buy it though 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 relatively expensive because the preparation is not 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.829
 we want it too complicated today 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.030
 just do it yourself 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.920
 I do not want to over it too 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.059
 ongoing chemical processes was 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.590
 the meaning for the Indian 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.579
 especially the Ayurvedic cuisine 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.620
 philosophize 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.030
 there are in the net in general and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.520
 on youtube in particular already one 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.590
 the whole lot gets really detailed 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.710
 I would like to know that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.870
 youtube-channel ayurveda school I am me 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.420
 Today really just show how to go 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.860
 can prepare yourself very quickly 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.690
 because it should be in my opinion 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.910
 actually missing in any kitchen 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.619
 we really only need it for that 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.270
 two pieces of sour cream needed 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 this can also be sweet mother and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 emergency is also normal mother 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.939
 Now we give these in a pot and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.720
 bring in at mid-heat 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.490
 melt 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.260
 once it's melted we pull 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.509
 the energy before along with 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.939
 smallest rush and two pieces for 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.619
 about 20 to 25 minutes if the 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.869
 take larger amounts increases the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.439
 time accordingly for three pieces approx 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.110
 30 to 35 05 pieces 40 to 45 minutes 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.420
 while sitting 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.950
 separate the protein molecules and the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.870
 Butterfett the protein sits down 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.790
 partly on the ground and partly as 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.530
 Foam of a surface from the look 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.360
 we occasionally take with a spoon 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.580
 off and both the protein from the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 surface as well as the sediment at it 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.550
 does not have to be thrown away 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.710
 is suitable for example for searing 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.360
 of vegetables and if your dream of the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.729
 surface neither take nor too 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.060
 the butter fat is getting clearer and slower 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.950
 becomes 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
 and otherwise there are changes 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.850
 At the very beginning the cook gave the butter 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.770
 what he made such a cooking 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.209
 water reminded of run in 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.950
 the time will be gentle 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.260
 globally and also initially 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.540
 sour smell then becomes something more 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.680
 The funny thing about simmering should be the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.020
 always a bit close 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.450
 stay for the latest from the 20 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.700
 minute is the danger of the envelope 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.650
 that means that the fat then easily 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 he does not burn it anymore 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 golden coloring but is now clear 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.200
 one can then while still 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.390
 but it is just in taste 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.840
 not so great anymore yes and so it has to be 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.560
 then stop looking 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.659
 in parallel, we have a law 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.519
 that can be made of ceramics or 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.250
 also made of thick glass and therefore 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.989
 Let's pour the hot one in and out 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.299
 I have one with me 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.819
 rubber kitchen towels in two layers on it 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.069
 attached but a fine mesh looks 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.170
 would be conceivable and bit by bit that was 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.170
 hot is now filtered through 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.350
 and when we're done with it 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.610
 this clear liquid left over like 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.000
 After some hours then 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.590
 cooled is what looks like please 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 do not store in the fridge 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.640
 Also do not leave a spoon in glass 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.750
 lasts almost unlimited and in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.550
 dependence on the room temperature 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.680
 It may be that in between, too 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.360
 again that becomes a liquid that 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.380
 But I do not do anything at all 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.690
 wish you success in the preparation 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.739
 it's not too complicated, I hope 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.739
 that I will load again tomorrow
