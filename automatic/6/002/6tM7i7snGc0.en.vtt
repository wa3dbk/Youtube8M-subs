we're<00:00:03.990> making<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.529> safety<00:00:05.160> product<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:06.120> our

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
we're making a safety product that our

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.670 
we're making a safety product that our
children<00:00:06.899> are<00:00:07.020> gonna<00:00:07.109> sit

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
children are gonna sit

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.560 
children are gonna sit
that's<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.160> child<00:00:08.519> restraint<00:00:08.880> systems<00:00:09.330> do

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
that's what child restraint systems do

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.360 
that's what child restraint systems do
we<00:00:09.870> want<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> protect<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> child<00:00:10.830> as<00:00:11.010> best<00:00:11.280> we

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
we want to protect the child as best we

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.330 
we want to protect the child as best we
can<00:00:11.750> in<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> crash<00:00:13.170> we're<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> only<00:00:14.070> facility

in the United States perhaps the world

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
in the United States perhaps the world
to<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.520> three<00:00:17.789> crash<00:00:18.090> test<00:00:18.390> slits<00:00:18.690> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
to have three crash test slits it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990 
to have three crash test slits it's
really<00:00:19.650> been<00:00:19.800> an<00:00:19.890> evolution<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
really been an evolution we put the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
really been an evolution we put the
first<00:00:21.210> sled<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.050> 1989<00:00:23.330> 2004<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:25.140> put<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
first sled in in 1989 2004 we put in the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
first sled in in 1989 2004 we put in the
first<00:00:26.099> state-of-the-art<00:00:26.849> sled<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> then

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
first state-of-the-art sled and then

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.570 
first state-of-the-art sled and then
this<00:00:27.900> year<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.230> put<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> third<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this year we put in the third this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.359 
this year we put in the third this
allows<00:00:29.939> us<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.929> great<00:00:31.349> number<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.949> tests

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
allows us to do a great number of tests

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
allows us to do a great number of tests
and<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:32.940> required<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.719> being<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and that's required because being the

are very unique we worked with Kettering

that would simulate what we feel is a

world everybody tests front to back but

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.250 
world everybody tests front to back but
we<00:02:40.620> decided<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.370> start<00:02:41.820> testing<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.050> side

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
we decided to start testing on the side

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
we decided to start testing on the side
in<00:02:43.440> fact<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> does<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.490> simulates

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
in fact and what it does is it simulates

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.500 
in fact and what it does is it simulates
the<00:02:45.510> intrusion<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.790> other<00:02:47.790> vehicle<00:02:48.300> going

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
the intrusion of the other vehicle going

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.240 
the intrusion of the other vehicle going
into<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> side<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.470> what<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.860> would<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
into the side and what that would do to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.040 
into the side and what that would do to
a<00:02:50.490> child<00:02:50.850> we're<00:02:51.210> trying<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.570> lead<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> way
