00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.749
 fried roscos de semana santa although 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.749
 They are rich all year 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.710
 we start beating the eggs 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.540
 we add the sugar and we continue 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.460
 beating but sugar must be added 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.510
 little by little until he leaves 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.510
 integrating with the eggs 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 we add the oil and we continue beating 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510
 the milk 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.130
 the scrape of a large lemon or two 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.940
 small lemons and the chemical yeast 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.940
 a sachet 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.009
 we integrate well with the rods and 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.920
 last we beat with the blender to all 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.600
 a few seconds to give it a final touch 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.789
 and that is a little more spongy 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.369
 now we start with flour if we go 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.350
 to knead the hand is put in a bowl and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.569
 start to wiggle with a wooden stick and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 then to showing with the hands but 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.649
 If you have a compounder for 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.819
 directly dough the flour 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.819
 is casting little by little 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.320
 the flour has to be thrown out to see that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.320
 he needs the dough 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 and leave a dough that takes off well 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the hands when it is like this I have 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.820
 gone to the table and I gave him the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 last touches of kneading with hands 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.530
 we make a ball with the dough and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.540
 we let stand a quarter of an hour 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.370
 Now moistening the fingers with 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 oil so that the dough does not stick 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.950
 we are forming the reds we take a 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.069
 little piece of dough we make a trickle with 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.069
 the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.680
 we crush that churrito 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.930
 we roll it on the table and we already do 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.690
 the rosco remaining the fold towards 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.410
 out here in the video maybe what 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.410
 you understand better 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.450
 We put a pan on the fire with 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.520
 abundant oil and a lemon peel 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.650
 when we see that the oil is fine 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.170
 hot we take the first rosco or a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.970
 piece of dough to check the dough 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.440
 that we have to explode once 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.150
 that has floated is when the oil is 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.459
 very hot and we are already throwing the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.810
 next removed in the pan what 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.870
 We put in a paper to remove the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.420
 excess oil we prepare the anise and the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.040
 sugar with the cinnamon first we go to 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.709
 rebozar it for the anise 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.620
 you do not need to bathe it a lot just round 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.989
 and back we put them to drain a little 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.190
 and then we had it for the sugar and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.510
 mixed cinnamon 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.700
 I have thrown a spoonful of cinnamon 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.700
 but the cinnamon to throw it to your liking 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.010
 and they are perfect for eating 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.010
 that you enjoy them 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.070
 about 40 reds come out 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.080
 and my little one says to see when the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.080
 can catch something
