I lost the phone with your number

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
I lost the phone with your number
I<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:04.030> truly<00:02:04.210> can't<00:02:04.600> spell<00:02:04.899> there<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.499> go

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I really truly can't spell there we go

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.729 
I really truly can't spell there we go
so<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.539> things<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.929> just<00:02:08.050> saw<00:02:08.470> is

so one of the things you just saw is

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.410 
so one of the things you just saw is
that<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.950> happen<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.399> be<00:02:09.519> online<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:09.879> Lars<00:02:10.300> was

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
that I happen to be online when Lars was

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
that I happen to be online when Lars was
online<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.140> saw<00:02:11.170> his<00:02:11.560> response<00:02:11.950> coming<00:02:12.250> in

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
online and I saw his response coming in

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.339 
online and I saw his response coming in
live<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.849> his<00:02:12.970> blog<00:02:13.209> that's<00:02:13.810> not<00:02:14.019> always<00:02:14.170> going

to be the case since I responded to this
blog<00:02:16.720> it'll<00:02:17.379> show<00:02:17.560> up<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.709> my<00:02:17.860> wave<00:02:18.069> client

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
blog it'll show up in my wave client

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
blog it'll show up in my wave client
right<00:02:21.010> after<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.489> refresh<00:02:22.239> my<00:02:22.510> way<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.780> client

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
right after I refresh my way of client

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.520 
right after I refresh my way of client
it<00:02:24.040> will<00:02:24.190> show<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.519> my<00:02:24.670> way<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.910> client<00:02:25.269> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it will show up in my way of client and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.550 
it will show up in my way of client and
I<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.709> continue<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.250> conversation<00:02:27.879> in<00:02:28.000> there

social networks called orkut we wanted

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.509 
social networks called orkut we wanted
to<00:02:49.840> build<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.230> demo<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.560> what<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.950> could<00:02:51.220> look

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
to build a demo of what it could look

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.930 
to build a demo of what it could look
like<00:02:51.579> to<00:02:52.030> put<00:02:52.209> waves<00:02:52.450> inside<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.989> orchid<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
like to put waves inside of orchid it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.309 
like to put waves inside of orchid it
demonstrates<00:02:54.940> three<00:02:55.299> important<00:02:55.840> principles

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
demonstrates three important principles

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.580 
demonstrates three important principles
or<00:02:56.890> features<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.519> our<00:02:57.609> embed<00:02:57.910> API<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:59.410> here's

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
or features of our embed API so here's

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.589 
or features of our embed API so here's
my<00:02:59.650> orchid<00:03:00.069> account<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:01.239> can<00:03:01.269> see

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
my orchid account and you can see

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.860 
my orchid account and you can see
there's<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.959> wave<00:03:02.410> panel<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.220> middle<00:03:03.489> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
there's a wave panel in the middle and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.569 
there's a wave panel in the middle and
the<00:03:04.870> first<00:03:05.109> thing<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.739> can<00:03:05.920> create<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> wave

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
the first thing is I can create a wave

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.030 
the first thing is I can create a wave
on<00:03:06.730> orkut<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:07.989> starting<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.349> new<00:03:08.410> wave<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
on orkut so I'm starting a new wave and

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.410 
on orkut so I'm starting a new wave and
I'll<00:03:09.160> say<00:03:09.400> Brazil<00:03:09.670> trip<00:03:11.220> wonder<00:03:12.220> when<00:03:12.639> bars

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
I'll say Brazil trip wonder when bars

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.349 
I'll say Brazil trip wonder when bars
will<00:03:13.810> let<00:03:14.139> me<00:03:14.410> go<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.400> second<00:03:18.819> important

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
will let me go the second important

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.300 
will let me go the second important
feature<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.380> use<00:03:20.709> contacts

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
feature is that you can use contacts

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.640 
feature is that you can use contacts
other<00:03:21.579> than<00:03:22.000> your<00:03:22.150> wave<00:03:22.329> context<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.200> this

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
other than your wave context in this

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
other than your wave context in this
case<00:03:23.919> the<00:03:24.160> authors<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.760> site<00:03:24.970> chose<00:03:25.269> to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
case the authors of the site chose to

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.720 
case the authors of the site chose to
use<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.720> orkut<00:03:26.079> contacts<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:27.190> i<00:03:27.250> can<00:03:27.459> add<00:03:27.549> some

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
use the orkut contacts so i can add some

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.069 
use the orkut contacts so i can add some
of<00:03:27.880> my<00:03:27.970> Orkut<00:03:28.299> friends<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:29.290> sid<00:03:29.730> torsten<00:03:30.730> and

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
of my Orkut friends like sid torsten and

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.400 
of my Orkut friends like sid torsten and
rodrigo<00:03:32.079> who<00:03:33.040> all<00:03:33.160> helped<00:03:33.400> build<00:03:33.609> this<00:03:33.760> demo

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
rodrigo who all helped build this demo

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.650 
rodrigo who all helped build this demo
the<00:03:35.410> third<00:03:35.709> principle<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.239> can<00:03:37.450> embed

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
the third principle is that I can embed

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.710 
the third principle is that I can embed
a<00:03:37.690> search<00:03:37.959> panel<00:03:38.260> inside<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:39.030> or<00:03:40.030> get<00:03:40.269> using

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
a search panel inside of or get using

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.589 
a search panel inside of or get using
the<00:03:41.139> embed<00:03:41.290> API<00:03:41.709> I'll<00:03:42.549> show<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:42.940> now<00:03:43.299> I

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
the embed API I'll show you that now I

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.710 
the embed API I'll show you that now I
can<00:03:43.690> search<00:03:44.049> for<00:03:44.230> all<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.560> waves<00:03:44.799> from<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
can search for all my waves from you and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.069 
can search for all my waves from you and
so<00:03:49.720> on<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.079> look<00:03:50.380> at<00:03:50.500> them<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:52.209> that's<00:03:52.389> waves

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
so on and look at them so that's waves

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.159 
so on and look at them so that's waves
embedded<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.739> orchid<00:03:54.510> what's<00:03:55.510> important<00:03:56.019> is

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
embedded in orchid what's important is

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.800 
embedded in orchid what's important is
that<00:03:56.260> our<00:03:56.680> embed<00:03:57.190> API<00:03:57.549> is<00:03:57.669> powerful<00:03:58.569> enough

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
that our embed API is powerful enough

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.569 
that our embed API is powerful enough
