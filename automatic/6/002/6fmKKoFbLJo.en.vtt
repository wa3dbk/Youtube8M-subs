00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.280
 new picture we have a little 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.130
 problem with mojang but we will 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.719
 simple could ignore because yes that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 is not that bad right now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.810
 In any case, we catch so much 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 is my area out where where we have one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.100
 Search space for our building out 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 can 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.960
 and yes, that looks pretty good 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 So it'll be fine 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.880
 happy to build a beautiful villa 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.880
 That's why I would like to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 first with a keynote beginning and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.660
 Ton brown is not really like that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 bad 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.690
 this could build my goodness building 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 okay then is the front wall 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 yes that looks pretty good 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.030
 So glass construction as new glasses 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.840
 I do not like it that way 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.280
 so we just take time is clear 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.329
 not stone but no matter 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.390
 soja that is already in front of the wall 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.330
 a good thing, the order comes out toward 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 kreml somehow come in any case 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.549
 you do not fall for all these animals 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.549
 so 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.770
 yes and now we can do it here too 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:34.500
 So go ahead make them so here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:38.760
 Windows are in there so what nobody 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.960
 as the roof is already a work keystone 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.280
 we can also do a little bit we 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 can therefore do a little medley 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.290
 So suppose sauces and navteq is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.590
 actually it fits a really good one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.270
 so red and brown that fits 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:01.500
 Everything so that's why I would be here 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:04.220
 make nice alarm sound and where are the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 other animals out 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.880
 we also think away because of that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.380
 wÃ¶rthersee otherwise a bit annoying 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.380
 to sound his little sound 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.450
 he is dead 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.580
 and here the very important that that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.620
 commission from the rush comes then you can 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 look upwards if you can 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.280
 Here you can from the top also 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.670
 look down we had it all 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.670
 important so we do it first 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.730
 first an organic form so one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.410
 can not make round but so 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.430
 bring little deeper in 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.630
 then fly was up and doing here 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.239
 is one that will be right back 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.970
 day so I can indeed times that was the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.980
 wrong button 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.310
 well that did not bother everything is still 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 in the orderly area roof windows it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.910
 finally not bad is always 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.020
 still glass delivery too ok behind 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:23.190
 actually now need not necessarily 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:27.320
 not to do with windows anyway 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 be a sign because that just suits you 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:36.570
 ok that would already like to roof with 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:42.030
 Refine this path and make it 42 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.010
 so that it has that way, that's okay 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.660
 Yes, many can do that too 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 Use diamond blocks are therefore 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.570
 important valuable so are the him 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.000
 won, of course, at the same time 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.610
 look nice 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.100
 That's why we make this wall 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.400
 Diamond and the gold is not right 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:05.340
 then also he knows himself texture 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.650
 is about so then we just set 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.930
 Doors once inside are yes 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.870
 as you know, better if then the block 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.989
 is still gone and so then you have here 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.329
 also a mailbox at the same time yes 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.289
 and the ground in there you can too 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.289
 be replaced 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.120
 So first we thicken everything here 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:41.660
 very comfortable here , something more 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.419
 a lot of that is quite a table for me 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:53.960
 You can do that here then you go up 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:05:03.169
 and we can do it down 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:04.569
 happen that is not 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.680
 closed no matter 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:13.550
 yes in any case, you still need it 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:17.870
 a bed and of course a few more 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.520
 Pictures so here still individually it bothers 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.830
 You can not do that to me a bit 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.080
 not looking in from the outside are 12 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:30.400
 for a few spanner yes okay and we 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.400
 Of course there are still a few left 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.890
 yes and maybe you do it this way 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.390
 and then and if you are from here 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.490
 then in the top then it is whole 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.650
 practically that you have here then 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.720
 So you have to be his 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:58.410
 have privacy as how do you do that 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:01.170
 one day and so we'll do one more thing 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.320
 little embellishment trifles that 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.460
 is not so important now but want 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:12.360
 yes anyway still appropriate 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:20.120
 yes and what an insider tip of 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:22.410
 if something teaches me, something is burning 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:29.310
 then sometimes it looks even more beautiful 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:35.180
 and you can hear that burns so okay 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.560
 then the table not gone through the 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:44.630
 I almost can not do it 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:49.050
 think more clearly but do not care 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.320
 yes and yes that already looks quite a 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.320
 good 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.600
 yes okay I'm completely normal so me 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.730
 have times changed me a skin yes 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.300
 not so from mojang or anything like that 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:10.510
 this last house we can do it 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.400
 Next time refine what you say in 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.540
 the comment so with the comments 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 I can not hear you in the 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.870
 comments, we'll write you that 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.570
 like the house and so and if I am 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.780
 should continue to build 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:35.200
 fire ok thanks what look 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:38.250
 until next time and watch time 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.250
 which date is today
