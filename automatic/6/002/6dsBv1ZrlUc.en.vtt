some work to achieve different results
some<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.990> work<00:00:31.140> what's<00:00:31.800> most<00:00:32.250> important<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
some don't work what's most important is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.340 
some don't work what's most important is
that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.450> play<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> such<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> way

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that you don't play it in such a way

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.340 
that you don't play it in such a way
that<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:35.180> will<00:00:36.180> cause<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.660> injury<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.290> that

that it will cause you an injury or that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.790 
that it will cause you an injury or that
is<00:00:38.210> sort<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> inappropriate<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.410> music

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is sort of inappropriate to the music

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
is sort of inappropriate to the music
that<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.190> playing<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.870> suppose<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> most

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that you're playing I suppose the most

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920 
that you're playing I suppose the most
common<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.700> popular<00:00:44.760> technique<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.780> be

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
common and popular technique would be

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.700 
common and popular technique would be
the<00:00:46.440> heel<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.250> technique<00:00:48.379> where<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> actually

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the heel up technique where we actually

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
the heel up technique where we actually
use<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.489> foot<00:00:50.910> leg<00:00:51.239> combination<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.170> foot<00:00:52.530> leg

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
use a foot leg combination of foot leg

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
use a foot leg combination of foot leg
strokes<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> best<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.079> about

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
strokes and the best way to go about

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.639 
strokes and the best way to go about
kind<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> developing<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.809> feel<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
kind of developing the feel for this is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
kind of developing the feel for this is
actually<00:00:59.010> spent<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.340> time<00:00:59.460> literally<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
actually spent some time literally just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
actually spent some time literally just
hopping<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.379> down<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> bass<00:01:01.949> drum

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hopping up and down on the bass drum

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
hopping up and down on the bass drum
I<00:01:03.019> actually<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.229> mean<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> pedal<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> drum

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I actually I mean the pedal not the drum

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
I actually I mean the pedal not the drum
itself<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.540> want<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> cut<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> very

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
itself you just want to cut it in a very

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
itself you just want to cut it in a very
relaxed<00:01:07.920> fashion<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.939> legs<00:01:09.119> loose<00:01:09.420> hop

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
relaxed fashion with your legs loose hop

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
relaxed fashion with your legs loose hop
up<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> bass<00:01:10.979> drum<00:01:11.010> pedal<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
up and down on the bass drum pedal so

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
up and down on the bass drum pedal so
you<00:01:11.880> find<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> better<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> best<00:01:13.020> balance

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you find the better the best balance

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.440 
you find the better the best balance
point

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.970 

at<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.690> point<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.230> find<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
at this point you're going to find that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.440 
at this point you're going to find that
there<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.280> places<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:26.700> feel<00:01:26.970> comfortable

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
there are places that feel comfortable

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960 
there are places that feel comfortable
there<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.660> places<00:01:27.870> that<00:01:28.050> don't<00:01:28.670> your<00:01:29.670> seat

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
there are places that don't your seat

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
there are places that don't your seat
height<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.510> where<00:01:31.050> your<00:01:31.200> position<00:01:31.590> position

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
height and where your position position

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.530 
height and where your position position
on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> seat<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:32.940> make<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.150> difference

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
on the seat will also make a difference

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.900 
on the seat will also make a difference
I<00:01:35.210> tend<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> find<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.470> play<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> ball

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
I tend to find that I play on the ball

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.030 
I tend to find that I play on the ball
of<00:01:39.120> my<00:01:39.150> foot<00:01:39.980> kind<00:01:40.980> of<00:01:41.190> roughly<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:43.040> don't

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
of my foot kind of roughly about I don't

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
of my foot kind of roughly about I don't
know<00:01:44.130> somewhere<00:01:44.550> between<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.820> third<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.180> half

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
know somewhere between a third and half

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.880 
know somewhere between a third and half
way<00:01:45.510> up<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> pedal<00:01:48.560> actually<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:49.770> point

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
way up the pedal actually at this point

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
way up the pedal actually at this point
we<00:01:50.190> found<00:01:50.460> our<00:01:50.640> balance<00:01:51.060> position<00:01:51.240> we're

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
we found our balance position we're

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
we found our balance position we're
hopping<00:01:52.050> up<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.260> down<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> bass<00:01:52.860> drum<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
hopping up and down on the bass drum and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.920 
hopping up and down on the bass drum and
now<00:01:53.940> what<00:01:54.150> we're<00:01:54.270> getting<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.869> heel<00:01:55.080> comes<00:01:55.320> up

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
now what we're getting the heel comes up

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.600 
now what we're getting the heel comes up
and<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.080> every<00:01:58.530> last<00:01:58.860> stroke<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.520> you're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and on every last stroke if you're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.460 
and on every last stroke if you're
playing<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.880> series<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.630> three<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.170> four

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
playing a series of two or three or four

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.040 
playing a series of two or three or four
notes<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.450> happen<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.900> where

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
notes what you want to happen is where

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:14.140 
notes what you want to happen is where
your<00:02:04.170> heel<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.680> drop<00:02:12.470> now<00:02:13.470> by<00:02:13.650> doing<00:02:13.709> this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
your heel to drop now by doing this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.090 
your heel to drop now by doing this
you're<00:02:15.150> allowing<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.630> beater<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.709> return

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
you're allowing the beater to return

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
you're allowing the beater to return
which<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:17.970> give<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.240> more<00:02:18.450> open<00:02:18.870> tone<00:02:19.140> on

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
which will give you a more open tone on

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:32.960 
which will give you a more open tone on
the<00:02:19.470> drum<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:31.220> let's<00:02:32.220> take<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> tempo<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the drum now let's take the tempo up a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:42.150 
the drum now let's take the tempo up a
little<00:02:33.120> bit

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.470 

so<00:02:43.160> here<00:02:43.310> what<00:02:43.460> we're<00:02:43.610> getting<00:02:43.730> our<00:02:44.060> foot

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
so here what we're getting our foot

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.080 
so here what we're getting our foot
strokes<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.080> leg<00:02:45.410> strokes<00:02:45.790> another<00:02:46.790> approach

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
strokes and leg strokes another approach

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.250 
strokes and leg strokes another approach

literally Barre the beater where the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.790 
literally Barre the beater where the
beater<00:02:52.520> actually<00:02:52.970> stays<00:02:53.530> against<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> head

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
beater actually stays against the head

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.560 
beater actually stays against the head
some<00:02:55.370> people<00:02:55.610> will<00:02:55.700> tell<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:55.880> not<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.240> do<00:02:56.390> this

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
some people will tell you not to do this

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.160 
some people will tell you not to do this
it<00:02:56.810> does<00:02:57.320> produce<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.920> very<00:02:58.310> very<00:02:58.700> thick<00:02:59.300> punchy

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
it does produce a very very thick punchy

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.040 
it does produce a very very thick punchy
tight<00:03:00.980> sound<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.030> quite<00:03:02.270> desirable<00:03:02.900> on

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
tight sound that is quite desirable on

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.370 
tight sound that is quite desirable on
most<00:03:03.709> drummers<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.250> 70s<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.910> 80s<00:03:05.380> playing

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
most drummers in the 70s and 80s playing

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.280 
most drummers in the 70s and 80s playing
pop<00:03:06.590> music<00:03:06.620> use<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.720> use<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.750> sort<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
pop music use this use this sort of a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.370 
pop music use this use this sort of a
technique<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.459> when<00:03:10.880> playing<00:03:11.180> with<00:03:11.959> using<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
technique so when playing with using the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.430 
technique so when playing with using the
Buried<00:03:12.770> beater<00:03:13.190> technique<00:03:13.989> it's<00:03:14.989> important

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
Buried beater technique it's important

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.750 
Buried beater technique it's important
to<00:03:15.709> make<00:03:15.830> sure<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.980> your<00:03:16.220> calf<00:03:16.370> muscles

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
to make sure that your calf muscles

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.820 
to make sure that your calf muscles
don't<00:03:16.940> tense<00:03:17.209> up<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.170> want<00:03:18.260> just<00:03:18.590> enough

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
don't tense up so we want just enough

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.250 
don't tense up so we want just enough
pressure<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:20.090> keep<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.360> beater<00:03:20.570> against<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
pressure to keep the beater against the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.440 
pressure to keep the beater against the
head<00:03:21.440> some<00:03:22.040> people<00:03:22.280> will<00:03:22.400> tell<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.880> not<00:03:23.390> to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
head some people will tell you not to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.020 
head some people will tell you not to
play<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.140> way<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.650> say<00:03:25.430> there<00:03:25.640> are<00:03:25.670> different

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
play this way I say there are different

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.520 
play this way I say there are different
ways<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> skin<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.480> cat<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.020> produces<00:03:27.470> a

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
ways to skin a cat and it produces a

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.160 
ways to skin a cat and it produces a
different<00:03:28.130> tone<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.330> here<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:29.900> go<00:03:30.020> we'll

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
different tone so here we go we'll

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:55.710 
different tone so here we go we'll
demonstrate<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.620> little<00:03:30.860> bit

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.470 

now<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.780> third<00:03:57.110> way<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:58.060> we<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.210> play<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
now the third way that we can play the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.870 
now the third way that we can play the
bass<00:03:59.630> drum<00:03:59.660> is<00:04:00.020> actually<00:04:00.500> literally<00:04:00.980> healed

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
bass drum is actually literally healed

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.120 
bass drum is actually literally healed
down<00:04:02.150> as<00:04:02.390> if<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.600> were<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.900> tapping<00:04:03.110> on<00:04:03.380> the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
down as if you were just tapping on the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.420 
down as if you were just tapping on the
floor<00:04:05.260> now<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.500> point<00:04:06.770> if<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.160> stay

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
floor now at this point if you stay

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.680 
floor now at this point if you stay
relaxed<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.750> spring<00:04:09.490> will<00:04:10.490> actually<00:04:10.880> return

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
relaxed the spring will actually return

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.310 
relaxed the spring will actually return
the<00:04:11.720> beater<00:04:11.960> to<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:13.360> this<00:04:14.360> produces<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.870> softer

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
the beater to you this produces a softer

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.810 
the beater to you this produces a softer
tone<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:17.320> much<00:04:18.320> more<00:04:18.500> open<00:04:18.709> sound<00:04:19.160> particularly

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
tone a much more open sound particularly

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.520 
tone a much more open sound particularly
if<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:21.739> head<00:04:22.220> with<00:04:22.400> no<00:04:22.640> hole<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
if you have a head with no hole on the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.740 
if you have a head with no hole on the
front<00:04:24.770> side<00:04:24.980> of<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.160> drum<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.450> sort<00:04:26.690> of

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
front side of the drum so sort of

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.940 
front side of the drum so sort of
technique<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.380> old-school<00:04:28.310> jazz<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.950> and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
technique that old-school jazz and and

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.890 
technique that old-school jazz and and
probably<00:04:31.760> early<00:04:32.150> rock<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.330> roll<00:04:32.600> drummers

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
probably early rock and roll drummers

00:04:32.900 --> 00:05:02.990 
probably early rock and roll drummers
use<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:34.580> literally<00:04:35.450> it's<00:04:35.540> just<00:04:35.600> that

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.870 

and<00:05:04.000> that's<00:05:04.270> how<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.449> play<00:05:04.569> a<00:05:04.659> bass<00:05:04.840> drum
