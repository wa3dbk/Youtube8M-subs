one<00:01:30.420> another<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.770> really

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
one another and I think that's a really

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
one another and I think that's a really
cool<00:01:32.189> characteristic<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> haven't<00:01:34.020> actually

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
cool characteristic I haven't actually

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.920 
cool characteristic I haven't actually
used<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:35.040> other<00:01:35.250> brands<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.210> multi<00:01:36.720> like

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
directly correlate between a marker and

of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> pocket<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> being

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
of the pocket can with so that being

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.550

said<00:02:03.030> even<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.810> line<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.320> well

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
said even that one line up really well

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.370 
said even that one line up really well
so<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.240> whole<00:02:06.540> thing<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.229> got

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so out of the whole thing I think I got

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
so out of the whole thing I think I got
to<00:02:07.500> give<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> 10<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> 10<00:02:08.399> between<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to give this a 10 out of 10 between the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.119 
to give this a 10 out of 10 between the
markers<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:09.840> lined<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.349> perfectly<00:02:10.860> and

markers they all lined up perfectly and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.640 
markers they all lined up perfectly and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I'm not sure if I can attest that to the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.640 
I'm not sure if I can attest that to the
fact<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> paint<00:02:14.220> markers<00:02:14.579> are<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:16.439> same

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
fact that the paint markers are the same

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.009
