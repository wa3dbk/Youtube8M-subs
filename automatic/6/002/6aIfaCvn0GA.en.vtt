is<00:03:27.109> probably<00:03:27.380> one<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.560> our<00:03:27.709> biggest<00:03:27.950> keys<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
is probably one of our biggest keys to

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.569 
is probably one of our biggest keys to
to<00:03:29.359> winning<00:03:29.630> games<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.109> know<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.769> there<00:03:30.829> then<00:03:31.489> we

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
to winning games I know up there then we

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.940 
to winning games I know up there then we
gave<00:03:31.700> up<00:03:31.880> like<00:03:32.060> 15<00:03:32.299> or<00:03:32.569> 16<00:03:32.810> offensive<00:03:33.470> rebounds

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
gave up like 15 or 16 offensive rebounds

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.259 
gave up like 15 or 16 offensive rebounds
and<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.220> lied<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> lot<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.790> second<00:03:35.090> chance

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
and I lied to a lot of second chance

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.150 
and I lied to a lot of second chance
points<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.720> really<00:03:35.930> hurt<00:03:36.079> us<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:36.859> can<00:03:36.950> cut

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
points to really hurt us so we can cut

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.860 
points to really hurt us so we can cut
down<00:03:37.190> their<00:03:37.489> offensive<00:03:37.760> rebounds<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.599> kind

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
down their offensive rebounds and kind

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.000 
down their offensive rebounds and kind
of<00:03:38.930> lock<00:03:39.049> them<00:03:39.230> up<00:03:39.349> a<00:03:39.470> little<00:03:39.500> bit<00:03:39.799> better

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
of lock them up a little bit better

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.470 
of lock them up a little bit better
think<00:03:40.489> we<00:03:40.579> have<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> pretty<00:03:40.880> good<00:03:41.000> shot<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.359> win

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480
