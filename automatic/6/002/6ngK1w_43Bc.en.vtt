00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.910
 Russian style construction company 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.910
 holiday homes and houses at affordable prices 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 hello today we will start a conversation 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.460
 about building residential houses from powerful 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.820
 materials houses and assembly 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 materials already in their area more 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 than at home from a bar 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.770
 they are more reliable and strong enough 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.470
 this house is a cinder block 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 at a cost it comes out more expensive than 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.530
 timber 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 but cheaper than other materials 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 such as brick one block modern 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.540
 Housing usually garage 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 combined home as we see on this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.560
 The object of the second floor on this house is made 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.350
 attic space increases due to 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.190
 the fact that another attic floor is located 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.670
 above the garage 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.830
 why chose the option attic floor 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.550
 defective 2 is saving in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.270
 construction does not need to block it not 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 need separate flooring insulation a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.570
 here is the second attic floor 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.970
 bearing walls are raised by one and a half meters and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.550
 the roof goes already warmed she is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.660
 wall and bloody 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.750
 in our region the thickness of the bearing walls and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.970
 fermented materials should be 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.570
 550 600 millimeters but usually in 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.120
 construction always performs on 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.310
 405 we see here is made a wall at 400 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.220
 millimeters but it is with obligatory 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 external insulation in the future walls 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.130
 this house will be lined with bricks 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.070
 between the wall and the brick will be laid 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.260
 insulation when laying bearing walls of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.360
 powerful material also need not 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.060
 forget external owls and reinforcement 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 there is a hidden armature but there is 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.980
 masonry mesh which hidden so and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.470
