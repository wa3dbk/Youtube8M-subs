 hi hello to kilian i hope you are 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.430
 pretty good and we're in a new 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.610
 video that I wanted to make the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.960
 villager room that stops doing and its here 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
 it is not a place to be doing and only 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.779
 that's why they strike or things like that come 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
 law in arizona calamardo calamardo good 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 a video that I wanted to make as a test 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.329
 to see what's going on I do not know if 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 line and have done it and yes yes so very 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.310
 well they thought just like me and me that what 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.130
 what do I want to do then in more 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.989
 specifically I want to know what happens if 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.880
 I put a zombie here for those who do not 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.160
 know of minecraft from pc when a zombie 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.960
 is already with villager to them there are two 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.060
 possibilities one that I killed him obviously 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.180
 and the other is to make it a 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.250
 villager zombie that the truth looks you are 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 see very well so that you would like to be 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.990
 a family not to you wat and boat and good and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.040
 we'll see what happens the truth I've never 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.129
 seen if those attacked in any way 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.930
 but do not attack me my friend there are 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.800
 the villagers 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.870
 to me there is no game we are going to try to leave 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.330
 and see if you can think of preparing the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.330
 villagers do not be all 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.990
 is burning because of this I ask and he follows me 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 chasing chases the villagers 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.490
 because he does not chase the villagers 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.540
 and I think it's okay let's see 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.370
 get away 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.870
 is that because they follow me and are supposed 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.930
 that I am creative and should not 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.180
 follow me but they do it and cooked 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.900
 granite 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.740
 let's get a little closer to see if 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.740
 wanted 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 to fight 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.079
 is there I thought 'I do not think he saw me 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.689
 when he has seen me and the villagers I do not know 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.829
 if you have already thrown them out but I do not think 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.780
 they are there 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.670
 or live with the zombies coexist 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.340
 with the villagers ok with this is weird 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.790
 if the zombie passes the villagers there 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.270
 there are the villagers and the soloist over there 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.739
 okay 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.069
 I thought something more was going to happen 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.459
 interesting but apparently the zombies 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.030
 happen from the villagers which is not very 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.860
 well I say stress it would be great that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.220
 they will attack and they will convert but 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.360
 It seems that this will not be possible yet 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.209
 so nothing else was a little 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.959
 test to see what it is that is what 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.900
 it happened, but from what I see, 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.080
 villagers so nothing I hope you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.110
 have liked this little video you what 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.110
 dices 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.840
 I'm sorry I hope you liked it 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.510

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.730
 comment and do not know why whenever 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.560
 I say that I speak too fast so 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.430
