00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.810 
has been I've actually put the cooking
spray<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.070> nonstick<00:03:59.549> cooking

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
spray on it so the nonstick cooking

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.620 
spray on it so the nonstick cooking
spray<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:02.030> once<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.150> put<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
spray so that once you put it in the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420 
spray so that once you put it in the
oven<00:04:03.780> your<00:04:04.140> hands<00:04:04.350> were<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.799> much<00:04:04.950> about<00:04:05.220> it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
oven your hands were so much about it

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.180 
oven your hands were so much about it
you<00:04:05.549> can<00:04:05.700> actually<00:04:05.850> let<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.239> do<00:04:06.540> its<00:04:06.570> thing<00:04:07.190> so

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
you can actually let it do its thing so

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.810 
you can actually let it do its thing so
the<00:04:08.430> best<00:04:08.640> way<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.880> do<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.840> take<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:11.459> -

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
the best way to do this is to take the -

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.960 
the best way to do this is to take the -
bacon<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.890> put<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.010> parallel<00:04:14.489> on<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.820> each

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
bacon and put it parallel on to each

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.800 
bacon and put it parallel on to each
other<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.540> then<00:04:16.200> take<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> filet<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.810> chicken

bacon I don't know if you can see that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.129 
bacon I don't know if you can see that
it's<00:04:26.259> a<00:04:26.650> better<00:04:27.430> view<00:04:27.669> on<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.930> looks

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
it's a better view on it so it looks

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.059 
it's a better view on it so it looks
