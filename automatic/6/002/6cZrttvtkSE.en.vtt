00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
but basically getting a certificate is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.219 
but basically getting a certificate is
good<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.549> teaches<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.570> how

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
good because it not only teaches you how

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
good because it not only teaches you how
to<00:01:10.260> teach<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> also<00:01:11.850> teaches<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.540> about

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to teach but it also teaches you about

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
to teach but it also teaches you about
English<00:01:13.080> from<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> grammar<00:01:13.799> perspective<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
forgotten or maybe never learned and it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
forgotten or maybe never learned and it
makes<00:01:20.909> employers<00:01:21.450> happy<00:01:21.869> looks<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> have
