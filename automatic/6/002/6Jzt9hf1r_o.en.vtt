00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:12.469
 Yes, it's Berne- this time it 's a practice of the passive slave part 2 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:15.590
 I found the new 9 good practice places that I would like to do with that 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.650
 The other party is right Do you keep it as a diary 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.369
 In that place 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:27.009
 It is Peach Castle sky of new stage 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:33.790
 I think I'm going to do it, so this should n't be a good practice, maybe 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:37.640
 The one who went last time is more open-minded, so it 's a real battle , so the percentage of damage is 999% 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.600
 I will only bump into the bumper 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.200
 I will 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.820
 Oh, it looks like this 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.890
 By ultra-high speed say the Heike 3 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.870
 By all means 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.180
 There is no eating wall or there is no Abe 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.920
 I think let's do it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.490
 Well like that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:06.140
 It is easy to understand the rectangular higher timing such as the flying direction 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:12.570
 It is pretty This is easy to do It's forehead 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 I 'm showing it occasionally but I wonder if I 'm going to show it now, I guess it's a mistake now- 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.830
 3 Then you will like that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.630
 Yoshi Hoi 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.229
 It will be safe to shield at the moment it's blown away already 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.430
 After wow Mitter 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:41.509
 If I hit it in a row, I would almost certainly get it in this case, but for that practice 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:44.380
 If it goes to practice that the shield button can only be done once, it will be practice 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.659
 I think that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.730
 I think when the alternative is that meteor Meteor Te scene to take off 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.560
 but 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:01.159
 When it is meteor 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.470
 If it is a shield hit if it is a hit in a certain way, if a character with a strong return in a self- employed return is hit separately 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.830
 I think it's okay too 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.030
 Eat you 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.640
 Match 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.130
 I need a cool decision 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.100
 It would be better to quit that kind of stroke, if possible 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.760
 Once one day hopefully 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.319
 If the shield button can go out and take over passively 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 I think Misaï½° and I wonder what calmly can Futchi 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.990
 Setter to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.990
 so 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.069
 Preparatory 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.880
 It looks like this 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.450
 I hope it's about time 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.910
 It is quite a mistake but Mister 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 cooler 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 As might be expected 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.500
 I'll show you as soon as possible 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.170
 after 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.400
 Most of the reasons for failure of this kind of acceptance of these oysters 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:08.070
 Predict what kind of attack your boat will come 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.360
 It shifted the timing may not know the timing or not be predicted Tariato 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.380
 Doug 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.290
 Real It is the lag is the best of the problem 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:22.580
 If you do n't have it, it's better, but there's no wall 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.860
 But this is the bumper in the air 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.220
 that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.450
 Let's print out the direction of collision 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.790
 Sometimes we fly in the direction of the wall when thinking 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:42.690
 Wall example I'd wall flies in no direction not 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:47.819
 So I think this practice is already 0% so it is 0% 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.989
 You can also practice that landing landing passive 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.950
 Well went can be various softening It is this bumper Truly convenient 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.620
 If you don't even have a labe 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.990
 The landing Ukemin I'd not be there Miss 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.910
 The other is timing like this 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.910
 I know it perfectly 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.790
 By all means everyone also practices 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 Passive in, please try the far of the case where the distance of the place Der 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.790
 Before rolling 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.230
 Naa's now mistakes that there is to roll back 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.240
 I will find a store 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.310
 This is behind you 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.980
 Heart 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:38.760
 Moth I'd also choices that say this is also not take a dare opponent passive It is each other to read 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:42.110
 It may be 2/3 readings of this or something of non-Gnonon . 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.410
 Accept what even took passive 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.720
 Read the cow as it is and come this way 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.560
 You can think of it in various ways. 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.120
 so 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:05:00.669
 But the good person who took the passive if possible is Toka whether I thought there are a machine or wisdom whether Ness and 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:05.260
 It is because a strong down-down communication with Anne rear so gallon Toka Falcon 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:10.090
 Nde there is a possibility that clutter the Yamaneri If you did not take passive 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.490
 If possible, take immediate action passively to the next action a 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.880
 I like better was in other words 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.199
 This live in mean that I think is coming to an end in around here 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.380
 And finally it was a report, but I recently started twitter 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:26.980
 I'm glad to follow you if you like 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.160
 The picture will be what to the name 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.280
 Not this channel name but this channel 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.510
 It is the same in Berunberun this channel name 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.410
 that 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:44.310
 The alphabet of the channel d at Bern in katakana to the ran of 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.210
 It 's not Ne cold cold would be what 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.610
 Not a thumbnail 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:56.160
 What a shalar ii The conker icon is exactly the same 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.160
 In ado ends with a note writing
