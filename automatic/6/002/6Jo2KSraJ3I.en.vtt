application<00:00:41.879> has<00:00:42.239> its<00:00:42.390> own<00:00:42.570> space<00:00:43.050> where<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
application has its own space where it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
application has its own space where it
can<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.710> documents<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.120> instance<00:00:45.149> all

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
