it I'm glad to get my angle grinder to
cut<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> threaded<00:02:09.330> rod<00:02:09.360> off<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.080> got<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
cut the threaded rod off I got what I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.740 
cut the threaded rod off I got what I
need<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.489> tight

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
need in there and it's tight

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.820 
need in there and it's tight
and<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.310> end<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:16.670> drilled<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.820> little<00:02:17.970> our

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and on this end I drilled a little our

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.180 
and on this end I drilled a little our
recess<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.100> there<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:22.440> nut<00:02:22.710> won't<00:02:23.010> be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
recess in there so the the nut won't be

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.340 
recess in there so the the nut won't be
in<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.580> way<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> gate<00:02:24.480> when<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> opens<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
in the way of the gate when it opens and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.070 
in the way of the gate when it opens and
closes<00:02:26.540> now<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> got<00:02:27.930> one<00:02:28.170> more<00:02:28.700> brace<00:02:30.080> I'm

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
closes now I got one more brace I'm

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.370 
closes now I got one more brace I'm
gonna<00:02:31.230> start<00:02:31.440> about<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:33.270> down<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
gonna start about here and go down to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.210 
gonna start about here and go down to
about<00:02:34.530> there<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.870> will<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.770> half<00:02:38.070> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
about there and that will be one half of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880 
about there and that will be one half of
the<00:02:38.310> gate<00:02:38.520> done<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.350> then<00:02:40.350> over<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> other

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the gate done and then over on the other

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.680 
the gate done and then over on the other
side<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:42.710> want<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.830> make<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> walk<00:02:45.150> through<00:02:45.420> gate

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
side I want to make a walk through gate

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.860 
side I want to make a walk through gate
on<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.740> end<00:02:47.330> because<00:02:48.330> since<00:02:48.720> I'm

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
getting an electric gate opener for this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.930 
getting an electric gate opener for this
it's<00:02:51.660> gonna<00:02:51.840> stay<00:02:52.050> closed

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
it's gonna stay closed

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.480 
it's gonna stay closed
99%<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.270> time<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> I'm<00:02:55.980> build<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.310> walk

99% of the time so I'm build a walk

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.280 
99% of the time so I'm build a walk
through<00:02:56.760> gate<00:02:56.970> over<00:02:57.240> here<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> gotta<00:02:57.990> do<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
through gate over here and I gotta do a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.160 
through gate over here and I gotta do a
whole<00:02:58.500> lot<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.830> digging<00:02:59.130> from<00:02:59.580> oh<00:02:59.990> about<00:03:00.990> where

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
whole lot of digging from oh about where

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.790 
whole lot of digging from oh about where
my<00:03:01.320> shadow<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:03.020> over<00:03:04.020> up<00:03:04.440> through<00:03:04.650> there

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800

I'm going to pour sidewalk up sort of
like<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.750> u-shaped<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.880> few<00:03:09.060> feet<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
like a u-shaped just a few feet on the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.660 
like a u-shaped just a few feet on the
other<00:03:09.660> side<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.140> pole<00:03:10.410> there<00:03:10.520> I'm<00:03:11.520> gonna

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
other side of that pole there I'm gonna

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.360 
other side of that pole there I'm gonna
sink<00:03:11.910> another<00:03:12.150> four<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.660> six<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:14.100> gonna<00:03:14.250> be

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
sink another four by six it's gonna be

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.100 
sink another four by six it's gonna be
32<00:03:14.790> inch<00:03:15.000> door<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.240> don't<00:03:15.570> want<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.780> too<00:03:15.930> wide

32 inch door I don't want it too wide

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.900 
32 inch door I don't want it too wide
because<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.709> way<00:03:16.800> people<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.220> drive<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:17.670> on

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
because that way people can drive off on

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.199 
because that way people can drive off on
my<00:03:18.000> lawn<00:03:18.180> mowers<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.910> that's<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> only<00:03:21.180> thing

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
my lawn mowers and that's the only thing

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.750 
my lawn mowers and that's the only thing
I'm<00:03:21.390> gonna<00:03:21.480> leave<00:03:21.720> unlock<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.580> meter
