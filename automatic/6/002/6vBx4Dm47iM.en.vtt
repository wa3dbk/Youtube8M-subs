00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.220 
virtual filmmaking experience directors
like<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> work<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.220> virtual<00:02:23.610> camera<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.900> we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
like to work with a virtual camera so we

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
like to work with a virtual camera so we
have<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> system<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.070> allows<00:02:26.670> them<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
have a system that allows them to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.930 
have a system that allows them to
manipulate<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.170> real<00:02:28.800> actual<00:02:29.160> physical<00:02:29.700> camera

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
manipulate a real actual physical camera

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.140 
manipulate a real actual physical camera
with<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> sensor<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.800> fed<00:02:32.130> live<00:02:32.580> into

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
with a sensor on it that's fed live into

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
with a sensor on it that's fed live into
MotionBuilder<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.440> actually<00:02:34.920> lets<00:02:35.130> them

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
MotionBuilder that actually lets them

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310 
MotionBuilder that actually lets them
manipulate<00:02:36.180> around<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.750> MotionBuilder

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
manipulate around the MotionBuilder

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.440 
manipulate around the MotionBuilder
camera<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.489> actually<00:02:39.060> added<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:40.280> monitor

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
camera we have actually added a monitor

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.080 
camera we have actually added a monitor
actually<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.989> it's<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.830> Wacom<00:02:44.280> tablet<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
actually it's a it's a Wacom tablet and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.530 
actually it's a it's a Wacom tablet and
we<00:02:45.300> use<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.020> our<00:02:46.140> viewer<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.090> our<00:02:48.090> input

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
we use that as our viewer and our input

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.110 
we use that as our viewer and our input
device<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.350> operating<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.340> camera<00:02:50.730> inside<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
device for operating a camera inside the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.860 
device for operating a camera inside the
virtual<00:02:51.690> world<00:02:51.959> from<00:02:52.769> there<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.870> integrate

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
virtual world from there if we integrate

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.289 
virtual world from there if we integrate
the<00:02:55.080> motion<00:02:55.440> capture<00:02:55.799> suit<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.670> those<00:02:57.030> two

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
the motion capture suit so those two

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.090 
the motion capture suit so those two
tools<00:02:57.600> integrate<00:02:58.200> very<00:02:58.440> well<00:02:58.680> into

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
tools integrate very well into

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.130 
tools integrate very well into
MotionBuilder<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.540> record<00:03:00.870> this

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
MotionBuilder we can record this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
MotionBuilder we can record this
information<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.010> they<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.400> actually<00:03:02.549> create

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
information and they can actually create

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.180 
information and they can actually create
their<00:03:03.420> own<00:03:03.480> shots<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.040> an

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
their own shots it really is an

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.120 
their own shots it really is an
exploratory<00:03:05.850> process<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.230> opens<00:03:07.530> up

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
exploratory process that that opens up

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.550 
exploratory process that that opens up
the<00:03:08.370> directors<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:08.970> whole<00:03:09.840> host<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.470> new

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the directors to whole host of new

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.600 
the directors to whole host of new
possibilities

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610 

lower<00:03:19.610> field<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.110> little<00:03:21.320> bit<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.530> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
lower field it's a little bit of a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.190 
lower field it's a little bit of a
special<00:03:22.520> case<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.150> terms<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:23.750> we<00:03:23.810> approach

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
special case in terms of how we approach

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.530 
special case in terms of how we approach
the<00:03:24.380> camera<00:03:24.770> because<00:03:25.150> obviously<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.390> it's

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the camera because obviously it's a it's

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.400 
the camera because obviously it's a it's
a<00:03:26.630> handheld<00:03:27.140> show<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.100> everything<00:03:28.550> is

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
a handheld show and everything is

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.680 
a handheld show and everything is
supposed<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.560> look<00:03:30.800> natural<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.790> not<00:03:32.240> planned

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
supposed to look natural and not planned

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.740 
supposed to look natural and not planned
out<00:03:33.020> but<00:03:33.410> behind<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.520> scenes<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.030> can't<00:03:35.360> just

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
out but behind the scenes you can't just

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.870 
out but behind the scenes you can't just
wing<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.710> need<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.310> need<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.670> have

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
wing it you need to you need to have

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.000 
wing it you need to you need to have
certain<00:03:38.270> plan<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:39.110> what's<00:03:39.380> gonna<00:03:39.500> happen

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
certain plan for what's gonna happen

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.560 
certain plan for what's gonna happen
let's<00:03:40.430> say<00:03:40.550> we<00:03:40.670> had<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.820> shot<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.240> was<00:03:41.330> broken

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
let's say we had a shot that was broken

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.660 
let's say we had a shot that was broken
into<00:03:41.840> five<00:03:42.080> different<00:03:42.350> takes<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.550> they

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
into five different takes so that they

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.130 
into five different takes so that they
could<00:03:43.820> get<00:03:43.970> all<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.210> action<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:44.810> spit

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
could get all the action you just spit

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.410 
could get all the action you just spit
out<00:03:45.230> each<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.680> movie<00:03:45.950> file<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.970> roughly

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
out each a movie file and roughly

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.180 
out each a movie file and roughly
speaking<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.990> data<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.500> layout<00:03:48.890> for<00:03:49.130> the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
speaking the data and the layout for the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.980 
speaking the data and the layout for the
action<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.670> took<00:03:49.940> place<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:50.870> they

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
action that took place and then they

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.900 
action that took place and then they
would<00:03:51.140> go<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.530> use<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.490> at<00:03:52.580> least<00:03:52.790> a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
would go and use that at least a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.880 
would go and use that at least a
starting<00:03:53.300> port<00:03:53.480> or<00:03:53.630> an<00:03:53.720> idea<00:03:54.020> for<00:03:54.380> what<00:03:54.590> what

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
starting port or an idea for what what

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.220 
starting port or an idea for what what
they<00:03:54.980> would<00:03:55.160> actually<00:03:55.190> do<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.660> beauty<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.050> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
they would actually do the beauty of the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.560 
they would actually do the beauty of the
previz<00:03:57.710> process<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.880> we<00:03:59.060> get<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.330> start

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
previz process is that we get to start

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.050 
previz process is that we get to start
very<00:03:59.840> early<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.290> with<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.980> directors<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:02.000> we

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
very early on with the directors and we

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.990 
very early on with the directors and we
were<00:04:02.390> working<00:04:03.230> constantly<00:04:03.740> to<00:04:04.100> preserve<00:04:04.640> that

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
were working constantly to preserve that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.820 
were working constantly to preserve that

the process of what we do we are

the process of what we do we are
actually<00:04:17.870> able<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.500> optimize<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.750> entire

actually able to optimize the entire

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.500 
actually able to optimize the entire
movie<00:04:21.230> hopefully<00:04:22.100> make<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.460> more<00:04:22.790> creative

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
movie hopefully make it more creative

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.220 
movie hopefully make it more creative
but<00:04:24.260> literally<00:04:25.070> get<00:04:25.370> more<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.540> cost<00:04:27.050> of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
but literally get more of the cost of
