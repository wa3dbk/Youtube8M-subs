00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
boys that you can see a generic team and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.830 
boys that you can see a generic team and
he's<00:01:00.649> playing<00:01:00.860> I<00:01:00.920> thought<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.219> right<00:01:01.370> winger

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
he's playing I thought the right winger

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.170 
he's playing I thought the right winger
for<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.469> Singapore<00:01:03.920> had<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.160> very<00:01:04.850> good<00:01:04.910> first

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
for the Singapore had a very good first

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.910 
for the Singapore had a very good first
half<00:01:05.509> and<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:05.869> thought<00:01:06.080> he<00:01:06.229> has<00:01:06.560> some<00:01:06.740> great

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
half and I thought he has some great

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.630 
half and I thought he has some great
tricky<00:01:07.280> moments<00:01:08.590> yeah<00:01:09.590> number<00:01:09.860> seven<00:01:09.979> but<00:01:10.520> in

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
tricky moments yeah number seven but in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
tricky moments yeah number seven but in
the<00:01:10.729> end<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:11.869> thought<00:01:13.840> right<00:01:14.840> back<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.380> left<00:01:15.979> back

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
the end I thought right back I left back

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.950 
the end I thought right back I left back
so<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.310> thought<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:17.119> end<00:01:17.300> probably<00:01:17.570> won<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so I thought in the end probably won the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.109 
so I thought in the end probably won the
contest<00:01:18.350> because<00:01:18.470> they<00:01:19.460> had<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.880> make<00:01:20.030> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
contest because they had to make the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.029 
contest because they had to make the
change<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:20.660> i<00:01:20.690> was<00:01:21.170> i<00:01:21.410> was<00:01:21.470> delighted<00:01:21.709> with

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
change so i was i was delighted with

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.230 
change so i was i was delighted with
Brad<00:01:22.280> because<00:01:22.490> he<00:01:22.580> was<00:01:22.670> up<00:01:22.729> against<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.119> good

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
Brad because he was up against the good

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.449 
Brad because he was up against the good
opponent<00:01:23.660> today<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.289> thought<00:01:25.009> in<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.340> end

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
opponent today and I thought in the end

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.540 
opponent today and I thought in the end
he<00:01:25.640> he<00:01:26.240> acquitted<00:01:26.509> himself<00:01:26.599> really<00:01:27.259> well<00:01:27.550> yes

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
he he acquitted himself really well yes

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.419 
he he acquitted himself really well yes
I<00:01:28.729> am<00:01:28.910> disappointed<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.729> mean<00:01:32.319> of<00:01:33.429> course

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
I am disappointed but I mean of course

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.999 
I am disappointed but I mean of course
the<00:01:34.789> chances<00:01:35.209> that<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:35.420> have<00:01:35.660> probably<00:01:36.500> hip<00:01:36.709> we

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
the chances that we have probably hip we

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.880 
the chances that we have probably hip we
could<00:01:37.220> actually<00:01:37.369> probably<00:01:38.030> Nick<00:01:38.390> one<00:01:38.890> but

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
could actually probably Nick one but

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.710 
could actually probably Nick one but
unfortunately<00:01:40.490> yeah<00:01:40.819> this<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.119> football<00:01:41.360> I

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
unfortunately yeah this is football I

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.199 
unfortunately yeah this is football I
think<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:43.039> have<00:01:43.069> to<00:01:43.310> accept<00:01:43.640> effect<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:44.149> I

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
think we have to accept effect but I

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.249 
think we have to accept effect but I
think<00:01:44.509> overall<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.429> positive<00:01:46.880> side<00:01:47.259> I'm

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
think overall on the positive side I'm

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.870 
think overall on the positive side I'm
very<00:01:48.319> happy<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.009> very<00:01:49.069> problem<00:01:49.610> two<00:01:49.700> boys

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
very happy and very problem two boys

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.059 
very happy and very problem two boys
that<00:01:50.239> you<00:01:50.660> know<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.989> have<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.770> managed<00:01:52.039> to

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
that you know we have we managed to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.669 
that you know we have we managed to
compete<00:01:52.580> with<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> good<00:01:53.720> site<00:01:53.929> Liverpool<00:01:54.470> site

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
compete with a good site Liverpool site

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.330 
compete with a good site Liverpool site
and<00:01:54.890> they<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.929> good<00:01:56.929> players<00:01:57.649> who<00:01:58.190> actually

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340

the fs strategic planning in and to
develop<00:03:22.620> youths<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:23.909> we've<00:03:24.209> having

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
develop youths so I think we've having

this<00:03:24.659> a<00:03:24.870> lot<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.170> tournaments<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.189> these

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
this a lot of tournaments like these

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.270 
this a lot of tournaments like these
international<00:03:26.939> tournaments<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.959> boys

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280

or<00:03:31.290> south<00:03:31.799> american<00:03:32.250> teams<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.639> think<00:03:32.669> it<00:03:33.060> will

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
