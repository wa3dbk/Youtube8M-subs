00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 that's the work of the bands Dormagen to German barns forwards because there 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.490
 they perpetuate themselves regularly and amaze the rural population very much 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.490
 quiet tracks art that made them famous 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.470
 Johannesburg 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 intellectual needs to live here for at least 20 people this afternoon 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 work is on the agenda 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.850
 In the backyard one has already been concerned about the growing protest mood 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 when the bands pick up on a pile back then, families get upset 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.470
 Each of the artists lived more or less from the New York Art Museum 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 one regrets nevertheless suspiciously 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.550
 Speaker of the Senator 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.910
 this whole art scene is so wrong but the more you could do with 10 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.650
 Paying in millions of dollars and I would not be so happy about it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.420
 People here that a diamond mine is a great idea behind me 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.460
 Here I would not go the submission of the world order 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 because a yellow 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.680
 we are a unity we need worldwide agreement reached 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 but I would have him from further leaks into the sea 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.990
 once a year it goes to North Carolina 195 apartments are still too 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.790
 paint 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.480
 The local farmers have become almost as Barnes Lama fans 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.170
 Capello continues to whom is even if they do not like our pictures 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.890
 Respecting at least that we work the same as they do when we get there 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.580
 we stand at dawn on bosom until sunset 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.910
 be recognized 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.420
 You have to be diligent in working as a rival 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.060
 otherwise there are no recordings to earn 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.840
 if you feel like you can join 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.710
 because so much is running and you wonder how many bands are normal in the eyes 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.809
 if he is Oberbergen 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.749
 I usually say over 30 at every one who was ever there for a day 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.579
 or their goal unless the hard core or whoever is here is one 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.440
 true drama 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.950
 we are not going we are not trying to be a cow and nobody thinks he is 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.540
 be better than the other we start our captain Norbert Haug we can 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.690
 who knows exactly what the children were doing when there was an accident at work 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:47.489
 it was not normal the first hour his first love was the yes-word first 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489
 later discovered their partners and cans 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.689
 his studio among them help orphaned many has worked with his 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.829
 Friends alone, as an artist, you easily fly on the cross 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.839
 Arnold Preuss 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.529
 I believe the art school clearly the school I had chosen me but me 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.519
 I wanted to paint together with my 30 members after graduation 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.419
 So I feel like the latter is ready for school b Andy Barnes 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.509
 Thomas actually became a kind of school for me that something in the 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.259
 did not necessarily want to join 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.259
 in the circus tour in Prora role like Kreuzberg 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:38.479
 After first investigations from the bonus pool she started with it 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.379
 he has his own culture the bosses in the fall but that experiment at the 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 Bands at that time as a creative enrichment 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:52.619
 the gate just short Jaderberg at Straden eBays Thomas are right they are one 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:55.919
 unique group maybe you learn something from me or me from it only 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.379
 if you think big, but I like it because Roger Benoit 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.810
 this has been a slow pace for two years 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.380
 and one of the most commercially successful members at least 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.609
 five of the list is the price of his pictures meanwhile his unique 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.039
 Calligraphy created the sky Â»fits on the canvas and on the street 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.900
 there 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.810
 Volvo has according to Porsche in German 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.840
 "I want to tell personal stories but probably she will 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.130
 You can never read anyone unless you study them word by word 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.540
 all four written off in the second paragraph at first it was dangerous 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.020
 but the danger of adventure has incited me 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.559
 and that's what Bgm creates 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.870
 through the region 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.029
 Bayreuth 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.229
 express it 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.610
 in the rest of the GDR will be some 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.620
 moved near 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.900
 however, that is only true if you do not use this art on all roads 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.070
 does not that mean that you can not go with all your heart? Â» 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.599
 means 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.899
 Sometimes I spend an hour on the street sometimes, but I also concentrate 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.899
 to work in the studio street damage rehearsal 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.789
 his ride away Werner 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.059
 Advertising becomes clear 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:21.199
 We are also so operated in the 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.779
 but there 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.659
 Ready we try the balloons has a damn large number of styles 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.389
 to find 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.340
 they are all so different but we learn so much from each other 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.919
 about the world and yourself and also about art 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.810
 the biggest challenge is to make the 2 0 you just can not do it 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
 Failure or you have to hide it quickly because the others are watching 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.839
 it is 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.289
 so it was really bad for the work the bands had and theirs 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.539
 latest time-lapse movie that will be read on sale for more in-depth 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.400
 In fact, the list of helps and warn that all fans were as well 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:13.309
 they should be made for this later this year
