 from outside you know what to do there 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.650
 researching the week is a correct one 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.920
 Delicious and have a very tasty recipe 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.670
 beetroot salad also and the players 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 very good if again 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.890
 It is still orange season five kilo 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 Orange is of course something else 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.280
 very special a few asked what 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 The season is also problematic 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600
 like to know this as a ninth yet 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.180
 I have also only in bioethics 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.319
 met 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.450
 Also very delicious is such a winter 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.860
 has spent a lot of us 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.769
 vitamin e gallopade or falls to me 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.940
 no matter what delicious one still 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.490
 bit of this natural park 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.220
 ripe kiwi comes very very valuable 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.280
 also every day with me rans 0 4 1 is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.210
 very good for the skin still 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.190
 exactly to that we learn the whole good 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.870
 wear on somewhere for the greens 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.630
 For example, move is a salad 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.790
 gladly worn 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.350
 in principle we use very rarely 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.570
 because then takes only coconut oil is also 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.580
 very versatile right 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:37.470
 high quality that is totally good for the skin 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:42.340
 detoxifies the 8 but again 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 therefore the sun on you to make 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:57.010
 Meanwhile a few but sweetmeats 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:59.170
 can always money as I would have liked 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.620
 facts I have so often with 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.630
 Barem and whatever I like to eat when 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.910
 you can feel something like booking book 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:17.410
 then we like each other and so 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:20.919
 give jakubczyk another tip 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.230
 are each other to the bananas for me 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.230
 they are not mature enough yet 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.430
 especially in the fast tire when you are 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.580
 keeps out in isolated portions 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.949
 takes and in 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.080
 gerda warm kitchen or environment 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.610
 then sets by simply ripe yet 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.229
 faster and if you just 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.020
 to the big carton and not so 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.650
 quickly this maturation to the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.750
 maturation process a bit 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.199
 then you want to slow down 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.400
 again this film airtight and off 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.909
 because of that, they are not quite so 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.699
 fast 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.490
 and if you are relatively fast 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.780
 there will be a secret tip 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.150
 acquisitions within hours 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.340
 would like to pack then you see for 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.340
 one hour malheur vending machine rhine 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.210
 you have founded lightning fast 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.449
 comparatively mature banner of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.909
 and as another tip grade than raw 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.590
 Babies have enormous banana wear 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:23.830
 and at least and many others 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.529
 I know 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.800
 it does of course then in certain 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.539
 distances the banana box so to 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.370
 example the idea is not yet 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.020
 ripe and in the cellar I have now 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.520
 already a mature to stand 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.650
 and if I've used that up 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.360
 the guests then already finished and 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.659
 mature because I have already then 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.930
 again a new half-ripe 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:52.960
 Well done that was it 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.129
 of course now the non plus ultra 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.949
 weekly planning is also with us 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.389
 Of course, no sense that occasionally 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.669
 happen where we are on it 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.349
 but yes things also opened in the 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.710
 our menu fit the order 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.289
 are 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.379
 the oberkircher must have certain and 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.319
 if you are interested in ours 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.260
 We also like neighbors 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.710
 again about it 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:22.020
 ultimately know okay today was 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:25.800
 Thank you very much for your purchase 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:31.190
 has watched and then until the next 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.190
 Choice before delicious reunion
