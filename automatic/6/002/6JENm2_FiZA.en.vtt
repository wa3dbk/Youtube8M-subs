00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:25.430 

you<00:04:03.090> sneak<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.780> peek<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.140> date<00:04:24.200> sitting<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you sneak a peek a date sitting on the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:05:17.070 
you sneak a peek a date sitting on the
bedrock<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.010> enemy

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.750 

more<00:05:18.080> bloody<00:05:18.350> tin<00:05:18.710> now<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.280> shouldn't<00:05:19.610> be

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
more bloody tin now I shouldn't be

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.190 
more bloody tin now I shouldn't be
pinned<00:05:20.000> down<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.390> date<00:05:20.600> but<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:20.870> have<00:05:20.960> picked

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
pinned down that date but I have picked

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:51.170 
pinned down that date but I have picked
up<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.410> bit<00:05:21.560> on<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.770> light

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.230 

so<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.210> thought<00:05:52.450> it<00:05:52.570> was<00:05:52.720> something<00:05:52.990> else<00:05:53.170> a

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
so I thought it was something else a

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.430 
so I thought it was something else a
little<00:05:55.950> hug<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:58.630> getting<00:05:58.930> that<00:05:58.990> towards<00:05:59.380> a

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
little hug and getting that towards a

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.560 
little hug and getting that towards a
gram<00:05:59.680> I<00:05:59.710> guess<00:06:00.130> a<00:06:00.660> little<00:06:01.660> video<00:06:02.020> this<00:06:02.320> morning

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
gram I guess a little video this morning
