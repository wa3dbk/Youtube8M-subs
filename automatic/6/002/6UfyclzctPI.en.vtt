00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
running the mtk6582 clocked at one point

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160 
running the mtk6582 clocked at one point
three<00:00:23.760> gigahertz<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.630> yes<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
three gigahertz and yes it is a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
three gigahertz and yes it is a
quad-core<00:00:25.500> device<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.820> let's<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.180> ahead<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
quad-core device so let's go ahead and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
quad-core device so let's go ahead and
take<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.930> package<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> once

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
take it out of this package and once

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
take it out of this package and once
again<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.429> did<00:00:29.609> come<00:00:29.880> open<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.810> customs<00:00:31.320> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
again it did come open from customs I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.900 
again it did come open from customs I
guess<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.040> trying<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
guess that we're trying to see if this

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
guess that we're trying to see if this
was<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> replica<00:00:33.780> devices<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.590> luckily<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
was a replica devices so luckily it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
was a replica devices so luckily it
wasn't<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> wasn't<00:00:36.809> seized<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
wasn't and it wasn't seized as you can

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
wasn't and it wasn't seized as you can

highly<00:01:05.670> doubt<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> an

chip for the gps and a gps it is very

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
millimeters and the batteries 2270 so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.640 
millimeters and the batteries 2270 so
that<00:01:27.720> being<00:01:27.869> said<00:01:27.930> let's<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.320> ahead<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.470> open

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that being said let's go ahead and open

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
that being said let's go ahead and open
here<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> package<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.210> some

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here the package and here we have some

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
here the package and here we have some
sort<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.900> flip<00:01:31.409> cover<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> phone

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
sort of flip cover and I think the phone

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490 
sort of flip cover and I think the phone
comes<00:01:33.299> together<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.170> let<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.380> go

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
comes together with it so let me go

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.560 
comes together with it so let me go
ahead<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> separate<00:01:35.369> these<00:01:35.579> two<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.150> guess

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
ahead and separate these two I guess

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
ahead and separate these two I guess
that<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> baby<00:01:37.259> did<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that I baby did that just for the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.249 
that I baby did that just for the
protection<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> device<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.049> can

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
protection of the device and here we can

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
protection of the device and here we can
see<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> does<00:01:40.829> come<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> flip<00:01:41.909> case

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
see that it does come with a flip case

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
see that it does come with a flip case
and<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:44.070> nice

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and on the back we have very nice

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
and on the back we have very nice
texture<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> front<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.049> going

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
texture to it on the front we're going

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
texture to it on the front we're going
to<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> window<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.520> going

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to have the window so I think it's going

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
to have the window so I think it's going
to<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.820> supportive<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.600> device<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
to be supportive for this device and it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
to be supportive for this device and it
is<00:01:49.829> great<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.490> accessories<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
is great when we get accessories like

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
is great when we get accessories like
this<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> USA

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this because we know that in the USA

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
this because we know that in the USA
they're<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.270> very<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.570> limited<00:01:54.930> so

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
know if that's going to be because

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
know if that's going to be because
there's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> features<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.979> device

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there's a lot of features on this device

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
there's a lot of features on this device
or<00:02:08.610> maybe<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.179> come<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.509> different

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
or maybe they come in different

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.449 
or maybe they come in different
languages<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:10.800> i<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
languages but right now i can see that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.920

they<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:12.030> English<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.750> definitely

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they are in English so that's definitely

let<00:03:13.680> me<00:03:13.739> try<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> focus<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.459> for<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.760> guys

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
let me try to focus this for you guys

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
let me try to focus this for you guys
you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.390> see<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.380> quality<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.860> lens

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
you can see that the quality of the lens

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.920 
you can see that the quality of the lens
actually<00:03:17.489> looks<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:18.000> nice<00:03:18.180> here<00:03:18.600> from<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
actually looks very nice here from the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.830 
actually looks very nice here from the
front<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.489> wide<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:20.880> meaning<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.660> has<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
front it is wide so meaning it has a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.530 
front it is wide so meaning it has a
great<00:03:22.709> aperture<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:23.819> could<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.150> an

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
great aperture so this could be an

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.449 
great aperture so this could be an
actual<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.959> megapixel<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:25.920> impressed<00:03:26.250> by

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
actual a megapixel so I'm impressed by

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
cancelling microphone we have here the I

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.490 
cancelling microphone we have here the I
new<00:04:11.519> logo<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.180> then<00:04:12.840> at<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:12.959> bottom<00:04:13.049> here<00:04:13.349> we

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
new logo and then at the bottom here we

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.400 
new logo and then at the bottom here we
have<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.889> standards<00:04:14.519> for<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.120> device<00:04:15.540> here

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
have the standards for the device here

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.349 
have the standards for the device here
we<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.620> see<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.070> has<00:04:17.099> a<00:04:17.220> dual<00:04:17.549> speaker<00:04:18.120> so

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
we can see that it has a dual speaker so

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.819 
we can see that it has a dual speaker so
that's<00:04:18.539> definitely<00:04:18.750> great<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.410> means<00:04:19.530> this

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
that's definitely great that means this

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.830 
that's definitely great that means this
device<00:04:20.130> could<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.400> very<00:04:20.729> loud<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.269> do<00:04:21.359> like<00:04:21.630> high

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
device could be very loud I do like high

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.140 
device could be very loud I do like high
quality<00:04:22.260> speakers<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.700> let's<00:04:23.880> go<00:04:24.000> ahead<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
quality speakers so let's go ahead and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.940 
quality speakers so let's go ahead and
open<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.720> see<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.169> think<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.620> has<00:04:25.710> this

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
open it and see I think it has this

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.770 
open it and see I think it has this
little<00:04:26.010> hole<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.940> side

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
little hole on this side

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.260 
little hole on this side
let's<00:04:27.990> pull<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.460> let's<00:04:29.670> see<00:04:29.820> how<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
let's pull it and let's see how the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.300 
let's pull it and let's see how the
internal<00:04:30.720> looks<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.530> here<00:04:31.680> from<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:31.950> inside

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
internal looks so here from the inside

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.980 
internal looks so here from the inside
we<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.550> see<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.150> dual<00:04:33.420> sim<00:04:33.540> dual

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
we can see that it is a dual sim dual

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.980 
we can see that it is a dual sim dual
standby<00:04:34.020> also<00:04:34.889> supports<00:04:35.310> TF<00:04:35.670> cards<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.300> here

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
standby also supports TF cards and here

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.900 
standby also supports TF cards and here
it<00:04:37.169> came<00:04:37.350> with<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.530> battery<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.190> battery

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
it came with a battery and the battery

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.390 
it came with a battery and the battery
is<00:04:39.300> actually<00:04:39.630> very<00:04:39.660> big<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.410> here<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.250> see

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
is actually very big and here we can see

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.020 
is actually very big and here we can see
that<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.500> 2270<00:04:43.500> milliamps<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.310> here<00:04:44.940> we

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
that it is a 2270 milliamps and here we

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.090 
that it is a 2270 milliamps and here we
have<00:04:45.060> all<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.020> information<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.710> it's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
have all the information and it's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.740 
have all the information and it's
actually<00:04:47.220> quite<00:04:47.580> heavy<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.030> let's<00:04:48.330> remove<00:04:48.570> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
actually quite heavy so let's remove the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.890 
actually quite heavy so let's remove the
tape<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:50.100> we<00:04:50.130> can<00:04:50.250> see<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.630> build

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
tape so here we can see that the build

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.170 
tape so here we can see that the build
