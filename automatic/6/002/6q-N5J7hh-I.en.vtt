00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
to record in 60 frames a second using

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.130 
to record in 60 frames a second using
the<00:00:21.869> elgato<00:00:22.320> device<00:00:23.779> usually<00:00:24.779> whenever<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140

out<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> 30<00:00:27.570> frames<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> second<00:00:29.240> there<00:00:30.240> they're

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
out of 30 frames a second there they're

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.389 
out of 30 frames a second there they're
all<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.340> editors<00:00:32.340> much<00:00:32.790> rather<00:00:33.270> prefer

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
all right but editors much rather prefer

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
all right but editors much rather prefer
59.94<00:00:35.399> frames<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.790> second<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:37.020> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
59.94 frames a second because it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
59.94 frames a second because it's
easier<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.129> easier<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.730> effects<00:00:39.120> like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
easier it's easier to do effects like

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
easier it's easier to do effects like
twit<00:00:39.719> twit<00:00:40.290> store<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.710> lurch<00:00:40.890> super<00:00:41.370> slow

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
twit twit store like lurch super slow

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.299 
twit twit store like lurch super slow
motion<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.809> those<00:00:43.440> times<00:00:43.680> those<00:00:43.950> types<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
motion just those times those types of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.459 
motion just those times those types of
effects<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.360> perfectly<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.079> 60

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
effects are work perfectly with 60

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
effects are work perfectly with 60
frames<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> second<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.879> really

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
frames a second and it's just really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
frames a second and it's just really
hard<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.570> 30<00:00:48.780> frames<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> second<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
hard to do with 30 frames a second so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
hard to do with 30 frames a second so
you<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> elgato<00:00:51.360> device<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.960> you're

then 720 ok before before I had this I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.200 
then 720 ok before before I had this I
was<00:02:03.060> recording<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:03.899> 1080p<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.790> file<00:02:06.000> size

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
was recording at 1080p and the file size

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.389 
was recording at 1080p and the file size
were<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.659> bigger<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.020> stuff<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
were a bit bigger and stuff but what the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
were a bit bigger and stuff but what the
difference<00:02:08.759> between<00:02:08.849> 1080p<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.750> 720p<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.679> at

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
difference between 1080p and 720p is at

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.970 
difference between 1080p and 720p is at
1080p<00:02:11.430> you're<00:02:11.940> playing<00:02:12.239> at

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
1080p you're playing at

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.759 
1080p you're playing at
30<00:02:13.610> frames<00:02:13.909> a<00:02:14.000> second<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:15.230> had<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.530> set

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
30 frames a second and I had this set

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.550 
30 frames a second and I had this set
before<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.330> looks<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.569> el<00:02:17.780> gato<00:02:17.989> can't

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
before and it looks like el gato can't

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.880 
before and it looks like el gato can't
keep<00:02:19.129> up<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> sick<00:02:19.909> um<00:02:20.360> with<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.959> what's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
keep up with the sick um with the what's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880 
keep up with the sick um with the what's
the<00:02:22.480> 1080p<00:02:23.480> since<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.110> such<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.709> higher

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the 1080p since it's such a higher

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160 
the 1080p since it's such a higher
quality<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.599> put<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.870> down<00:02:26.959> to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
quality so they have to put it down to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.839 
quality so they have to put it down to
30<00:02:27.650> frames<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.980> second<00:02:28.340> but<00:02:28.459> if<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.640> play<00:02:28.790> at

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
30 frames a second but if you play at

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.940 
30 frames a second but if you play at
720p<00:02:29.510> you're<00:02:29.930> playing<00:02:30.140> at<00:02:30.290> 60<00:02:30.620> frames<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
720p you're playing at 60 frames a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.670 
720p you're playing at 60 frames a
second<00:02:31.310> basically<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.230> that's<00:02:33.230> basically<00:02:33.440> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
second basically and that's basically it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.180 
second basically and that's basically it
so<00:02:34.099> make<00:02:34.580> sure<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.540> set<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.959> 720p<00:02:36.560> or<00:02:36.920> else

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
so make sure this is set to 720p or else

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.320 
so make sure this is set to 720p or else
you're<00:02:37.370> not<00:02:37.519> going<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> be<00:02:37.760> able<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.940> record<00:02:38.180> in

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
you're not going to be able to record in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.850 
you're not going to be able to record in
60<00:02:38.629> frames<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.930> second<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:39.560> you're<00:02:39.709> going<00:02:39.799> to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
60 frames a second so you're going to

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.619 
60 frames a second so you're going to
head<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.310> click<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.970> then

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
head it and click on that and then

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.170 
head it and click on that and then
