00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hellas how to compute here and today I'm

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
hellas how to compute here and today I'm
going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.969> showing<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.330> how<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.509> use<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
going to be showing you how to use the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.320 
going to be showing you how to use the
katana<00:00:16.770> voice<00:00:17.490> search<00:00:18.080> outside<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> US<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
katana voice search outside of the US so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.480 
katana voice search outside of the US so
this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> simple<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.410> anyone<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this is a simple way for anyone that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
this is a simple way for anyone that
doesn't<00:00:23.670> live<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> United<00:00:24.689> States<00:00:25.460> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
doesn't live in the United States to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
doesn't live in the United States to
actually<00:00:26.820> go<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> voice<00:00:27.330> search<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> use

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
actually go on the voice search and use

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
actually go on the voice search and use
it<00:00:28.740> using<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> voice<00:00:29.640> instead<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it using just the voice instead of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.139 
it using just the voice instead of
typing<00:00:30.470> because<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> moment<00:00:31.820> let's<00:00:32.820> see

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
typing because at the moment let's see

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
typing because at the moment let's see
it<00:00:33.540> says<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:34.410> disabled<00:00:34.890> by<00:00:34.980> company<00:00:35.460> policy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it says it's disabled by company policy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.869 
it says it's disabled by company policy
basically<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.920> been<00:00:38.129> set<00:00:38.850> up

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
basically because it's not been set up

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.150 
basically because it's not been set up
properly<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.840> people<00:00:40.320> outside<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> uart

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
properly for people outside of the uart

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010 
properly for people outside of the uart
estate<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.879> guessing<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.899> with

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
estate so I'm guessing just to do with

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.250 
estate so I'm guessing just to do with
why<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:44.010> set<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> United<00:00:45.329> States<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.870> voice

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
why it's set to United States like voice

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.930 
why it's set to United States like voice
and<00:00:46.620> stuff<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.450> but<00:00:48.450> let's<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.200> started<00:00:49.350> so
