 [Music] 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.550
 look at the senses in dogs 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.609
 are the fact and the hearing the vision comes in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 third place but does not fail to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.240
 be important 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.330
 cataract, for example, can lead to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 blindness problem and if diagnosed 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.670
 you have to reverse your 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 as well as for us human beings 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.860
 life expectancy of dogs only increases 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 and this is also due to the careful 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 owners will start with the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 there is food already 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 destined for the phases of life then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 have food for the puppies food 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.219
 for adult dog and dog food already 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the senile phase 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.899
 these foods are also differentiated 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 in relation to the animal's 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.760
 all this causes the power to be 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 directed to that dog according to 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.470
 your age with your race and your 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.990
 size with your carrying this food 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 being balanced makes all the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.369
 nutrients needed vitamins salts 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.080
 minerals are incorporated into the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 day- to- day diet and makes the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.009
 individual has a very long life span. 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.549
 bigger than he used to be. 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.040
 I ate polenta with rice, right? 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.619
 we also have other factors like 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.869
 vaccines or prevention of diseases 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 today the vaccinated dogs they do not die 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 of infectious diseases as 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 parvovirus and other viruses 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.920
 such as leptospirosis, hepatitis 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 present in vaccination 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 today we have a differential advantage 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.790
 prior to vascular therapies medications 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.350
 for vascular therapies medications for 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.549
 children's heart disease medications 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 vitamins and supplements 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.469
 data for an animal at an older age 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.899
 and various procedures that make the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.290
 people have more news as exams 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.360
 more is dental prophylaxis 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.759
 radiology photography 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 everything makes us achieve 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.010
 diagnose problems earlier 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 a few years ago the dogs lived from 10 to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.480
 12 years 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.580
 nowadays they live 18 years 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 just like a human the dogs also 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 develop diseases such as moving forward 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 age 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 cataract is one of these diseases 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.620
 diabetes and internal information can 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.740
 trigger the cataract and look 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.520
 estimates from the 6 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.310
 40% of dogs will have cataract 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.800
 through this photo you can know how 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.350
 it is the dog's vision that unlike what 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.670
 many think he can see himself 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.860
 Colors 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.070
 in the early stage of the cataract 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.590
 sees in an advanced stage the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.680
 vision becomes completely whitish 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.989
 in the normal canine eye the lens is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.140
 completely transparent as if it were a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.900
 glass when this region has cataracts 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.020
 is white, preventing vision 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.630
 some breeds are more pre- 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.420
 have this disease in the eyes 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:24.870
 number one of veterinary dentistry 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:28.250
 of the ten dogs second place comes the cope 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 then the other races 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.390
 if you are in doubt if your pet 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.440
 cataract suffers and attentive 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.350
 symptoms 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.780
 the owner notices a white inside the eyes 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.660
 in the eyes girl the white ribbon and 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.680
 primarily a difficulty in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.200
 moving in the environment head the objects 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.630
 Can not find the ball easier when 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.160
 plays ball and that's what happened 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.220
 with 11 year old babi poodle 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.810
 where I was walking typical symptom 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.880
 cataract 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.620
 the animal has already undergone 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.020
 reversion in one eye 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.050
 two months from now with the 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.750
 recovery of vision even in one eye 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.480
 she has already become another bad bitch for 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.040
 This one has enough energy to celebrate 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.040
 the back of vision 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.340
 if your dog hits the furniture 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.590
 find your toys 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.960
 here is a hint any sign of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.680
 eye discomfort and redness 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.170
 excessive tearing or deficit 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.020
 visual impairment is 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.390
 look for a qualified professional 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.610
 veterinary ophthalmologist no longer 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.190
 It's worth the hint of you at least every 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.310
 46 months make an evaluation 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.920
 your dog's ophthalmological 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.740
 the fans you will use your kite case 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.060
 crosses many diseases is the end of the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.100
 hereditary obligations 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.170
 as well as for humans the treatment 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.990
 for cataract is through surgery 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.360
 in this recording where a camera was 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.670
 adapted to the surgical microscope is 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.000
 understand how the procedure is 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.250
 made through a small incision 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.380
 the entire lens is removed from the eye at 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.080
 frequency is injected a lens that 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.720
 replaces the unique natural lens 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.290
 treatment for cataracts is 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.990
 surgery does not exist in exchanges and oral 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.540
 there are no eye drops that have reversed this 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.640
 natural lens capacity 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.430
 so you have to go mechanically 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.880
 remove this capability 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.919
 after removal in the cataract there is 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.270
 possibility of implanting a lens 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.860
 visual acuity is returned to the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.650
 dog a cat 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.419
 so there are specific lenses made 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.240
 the animals nowadays 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.390
 the sooner a cataract is diagnosed 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.640
 the greater the probability of success 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.160
 to look after your animal's eyes 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.430
 is to ensure more quality 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.460
 of life and taught him 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.440
 very serious clinical repercussions 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.169
 then intraocular inflammation very 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.960
 difficult to control glaucoma itself 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.240
 which increased intraocular pressure and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.550
 often are diseases that are difficult to 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.120
 treatment and often following the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.120
 become irreversible 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.920
