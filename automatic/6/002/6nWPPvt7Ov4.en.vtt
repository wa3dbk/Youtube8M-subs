the particular area of the APS which
I've<00:00:17.369> chosen<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.420> scene<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.250> pixels<00:00:20.250> per

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I've chosen for this scene is pixels per

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.000 
I've chosen for this scene is pixels per
polygon<00:00:20.910> now<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.690> are<00:00:21.810> three

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
polygon now there are three

polygon now there are three
sub-divisional<00:00:23.010> levels<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.880> can

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
sub-divisional levels which we can

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.350 
sub-divisional levels which we can
choose<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.860> instance<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:27.030> chosen

choose and in this instance I've chosen

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.380 
choose and in this instance I've chosen
pixels<00:00:28.050> per<00:00:28.530> polygon<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.730> let<00:00:30.060> me<00:00:30.150> play<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
pixels per polygon and let me play this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.720 
pixels per polygon and let me play this
little<00:00:30.630> animation<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.530> for<00:00:31.770> you<00:00:31.950> and<00:00:32.129> I'll

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
little animation here for you and I'll

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
little animation here for you and I'll
just<00:00:32.910> bribe<00:00:33.629> quickly<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.980> I've<00:00:35.100> done<00:00:35.280> with

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
just bribe quickly what I've done with

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.029 
just bribe quickly what I've done with
this<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:39.649> what's<00:00:40.649> happened<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.749> when<00:00:42.749> the

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
this now what's happened is when the

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.779 
this now what's happened is when the
camera<00:00:44.039> is<00:00:44.219> closed<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.460> pixels<00:00:47.460> per

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
camera is closed up the pixels per

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.419 
camera is closed up the pixels per
polygon<00:00:48.300> allow<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.019> pixel<00:00:49.499> level<00:00:49.649> control

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
polygon allow for pixel level control

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.290 
polygon allow for pixel level control
over<00:00:50.969> desolation<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.319> the<00:00:52.379> object<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.159> I<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
over desolation of the object and I can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.419 
over desolation of the object and I can
set<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:54.749> amount<00:00:54.839> of<00:00:55.170> pixels<00:00:55.379> desired<00:00:56.039> for

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
set the amount of pixels desired for

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.829 
set the amount of pixels desired for
each<00:00:56.519> polygon<00:00:56.999> and<00:00:58.159> large<00:00:59.159> numbers<00:00:59.699> if<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
each polygon and large numbers if you

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.200 
each polygon and large numbers if you
choose<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> large<00:01:01.409> value<00:01:02.159> large<00:01:02.519> numbers<00:01:02.940> will

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
choose a large value large numbers will

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
choose a large value large numbers will
result<00:01:03.569> in<00:01:03.780> coarser<00:01:04.530> tessellation<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
result in coarser tessellation of the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.320 
result in coarser tessellation of the
object<00:01:05.940> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.990> choose<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> smaller<00:01:07.710> value<00:01:08.330> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
object if you choose a smaller value it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
object if you choose a smaller value it
will<00:01:09.690> result<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.560> larger<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.760> refined

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
will result in larger and more refined

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.640 
will result in larger and more refined
tessellation<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.610> case<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.500> kept<00:01:16.500> when

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
tessellation so in this case I kept when

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.950 
tessellation so in this case I kept when
the<00:01:16.770> cameras<00:01:17.070> closed<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.850> been<00:01:18.240> more

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the cameras closed up it's been more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.930 
the cameras closed up it's been more
refined<00:01:19.440> tessellation<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.910> as<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> cameras

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
refined tessellation and as the cameras

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.550 
refined tessellation and as the cameras
move<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:27.810> become<00:01:28.590> coarser<00:01:30.560> thus

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
move the way it's become coarser thus

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.390 
move the way it's become coarser thus
speeding<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.550> rendering<00:01:33.480> times<00:01:37.280> let<00:01:38.280> me

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
speeding up rendering times let me

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.330 
speeding up rendering times let me
explain<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.120> set<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.050> scene<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
explain how I set the scene up for the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
explain how I set the scene up for the
render<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.910> basically<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> selected<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
render is basically I selected the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.550 
render is basically I selected the
object<00:01:44.160> in<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.820> scene<00:01:45.060> open<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.140> object

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
object in the scene open the object

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
object in the scene open the object
properties<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.550> any<00:01:48.450> object<00:01:48.840> properties

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
properties and any object properties

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
properties and any object properties
you'll<00:01:49.650> notice<00:01:49.980> that<00:01:50.010> render<00:01:50.460> sub<00:01:50.670> patch

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you'll notice that render sub patch

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.970 
you'll notice that render sub patch
level<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.780> usually<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.200> defaulted<00:01:52.830> at

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
level it will usually be defaulted at

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.820 
level it will usually be defaulted at
the<00:01:53.070> per<00:01:53.310> object<00:01:53.520> level<00:01:53.960> what<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> had<00:01:55.290> done<00:01:55.500> has

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the per object level what I had done has

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.070 
the per object level what I had done has
gone<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> pixels<00:01:56.670> per<00:01:56.880> polygon<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
gone to pixels per polygon now the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.190 
gone to pixels per polygon now the
values<00:01:58.620> usually<00:01:59.130> default<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.820> at<00:02:00.200> 256<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.680> had

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
values usually default it at 256 I had

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.440 
values usually default it at 256 I had
dropped<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.290> level<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.340> 40<00:02:06.240> which

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
dropped that level down to 40 which

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.050 
dropped that level down to 40 which
actually<00:02:06.720> means<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.380> makes<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.950> geometry<00:02:08.580> are

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
actually means it makes the geometry are

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
actually means it makes the geometry are
much<00:02:09.629> more<00:02:09.810> dense<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> experiment<00:02:11.370> with

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
much more dense you can experiment with

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
much more dense you can experiment with
your<00:02:11.879> own<00:02:11.940> values<00:02:12.269> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.020> drop<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.890> value

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
your own values if you drop the value

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.260 
your own values if you drop the value
even<00:02:14.340> more

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
even more

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.010 
even more
the<00:02:16.230> detail<00:02:16.860> will<00:02:17.070> become<00:02:17.430> even<00:02:17.670> greater<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the detail will become even greater the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.410 
the detail will become even greater the
great<00:02:19.230> thing<00:02:19.260> about<00:02:19.620> pixels<00:02:20.310> per<00:02:20.610> polygon<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
great thing about pixels per polygon is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.130 
great thing about pixels per polygon is
it<00:02:21.780> automatically<00:02:22.770> increases<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.670> decreases

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
it automatically increases or decreases

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520 
it automatically increases or decreases
the<00:02:25.400> detail<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.030> geometry<00:02:27.600> depending<00:02:28.320> on

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the detail of the geometry depending on

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.280 
the detail of the geometry depending on
the<00:02:28.770> distance<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> camera<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.510> object

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the distance of the camera to the object

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.610 
the distance of the camera to the object
so<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:35.370> another<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.660> runs<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.110> done<00:02:37.380> in

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
so here is another or runs right done in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.070 
so here is another or runs right done in
wireframe<00:02:37.890> mode<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:39.180> show<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> what<00:02:39.870> was

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
wireframe mode to show you what was

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.610

actually<00:02:40.410> happening<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.550> geometry<00:02:42.620> for

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually happening to the geometry for

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.230 
actually happening to the geometry for
the<00:02:44.010> example<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.640> gave<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.940> at<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.090> beginning

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the example I gave you at the beginning

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.800 
the example I gave you at the beginning
and<00:02:45.950> what<00:02:46.950> was<00:02:47.100> happening<00:02:47.610> at<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> beginning

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and what was happening at the beginning

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
and what was happening at the beginning
of<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.980> animation<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:51.390> as<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:53.550> camera<00:02:53.790> was

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
of the animation was as the camera was

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.450 
of the animation was as the camera was
closed<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.970> level<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.540> detail<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.250> mesh

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
closed the level of detail in the mesh

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.330 
closed the level of detail in the mesh
was<00:02:59.790> very<00:03:00.060> very<00:03:00.300> dense<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.050> as<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.920> camera

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
was very very dense and as the camera

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.360 
was very very dense and as the camera
moved<00:03:02.580> further<00:03:02.910> away<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.960> object<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
moved further away from the object the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.810 
moved further away from the object the
level<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.180> detail<00:03:06.240> in<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.140> geometry<00:03:07.820> had

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
level of detail in the geometry had

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.390 
level of detail in the geometry had
become<00:03:09.770> much<00:03:10.770> less<00:03:12.050> so<00:03:13.050> there's<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.920> pixels

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
become much less so there's the pixels

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.330 
become much less so there's the pixels
per<00:03:14.610> polygon<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:16.410> how<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.830> works<00:03:17.040> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
per polygon and how it works and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.180 
per polygon and how it works and
remember<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.390> working<00:03:18.990> out<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.500> level<00:03:20.100> of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
remember it's working out a level of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.940 
remember it's working out a level of
detail<00:03:20.810> automatically<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.380> I'm<00:03:22.470> not<00:03:22.500> having

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
detail automatically so I'm not having

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.160 
detail automatically so I'm not having
tired<00:03:23.360> anything<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.510> there<00:03:24.660> I'm<00:03:24.780> not<00:03:24.870> having

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
tired anything in there I'm not having

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.199 
tired anything in there I'm not having
to<00:03:25.290> add<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> gradient<00:03:25.860> or<00:03:26.190> an<00:03:26.310> envelope<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.970> that

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
to add a gradient or an envelope to that

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.699 
to add a gradient or an envelope to that
it<00:03:27.750> knows<00:03:28.260> exactly<00:03:29.870> how<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.900> work<00:03:31.350> out<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it knows exactly how to work out the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.530 
it knows exactly how to work out the
