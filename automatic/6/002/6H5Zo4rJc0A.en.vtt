it'll<00:02:01.840> give<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.229> sounds<00:02:02.679> that<00:02:02.860> no<00:02:03.190> solid

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
it'll give you sounds that no solid

state no matter how good it is can
reproduce<00:02:05.920> but<00:02:06.819> then<00:02:07.060> there's<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:07.390> rectifier

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
reproduce but then there's the rectifier

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.830 
reproduce but then there's the rectifier
crowd<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.739> sure<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.000> dual<00:02:10.239> rectifier

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
crowd and sure I'm a so dual rectifier

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570 
crowd and sure I'm a so dual rectifier
it's<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.230> all<00:02:11.379> Distortion<00:02:12.040> you'll<00:02:12.190> ever<00:02:12.310> need

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it's got all Distortion you'll ever need

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's got all Distortion you'll ever need
and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:12.940> some<00:02:13.209> but<00:02:14.080> 90%<00:02:14.709> if<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.430> more<00:02:15.849> of<00:02:15.879> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and then some but 90% if not more of the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.369 
and then some but 90% if not more of the
people<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> see<00:02:16.780> using<00:02:17.019> them<00:02:17.230> have

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
people that I see using them have

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.410 
people that I see using them have
absolutely<00:02:17.620> no<00:02:18.220> idea<00:02:18.370> how<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> operate<00:02:18.910> them

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
absolutely no idea how to operate them

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.759 
absolutely no idea how to operate them
and<00:02:19.599> they<00:02:20.319> sound<00:02:20.920> horrible<00:02:22.590> some<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.680> these

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
and they sound horrible some of these

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.530 
and they sound horrible some of these
guys<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.069> been<00:02:24.190> using<00:02:24.370> rectifiers<00:02:25.239> since

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
guys have been using rectifiers since

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.790 
guys have been using rectifiers since
they<00:02:25.660> first<00:02:25.930> came<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.410> they<00:02:26.470> still<00:02:26.709> don't

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
they first came out and they still don't

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.920 
they first came out and they still don't
know<00:02:26.890> how<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.099> work<00:02:27.370> them<00:02:27.550> properly<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.690> lot

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
know how to work them properly and a lot

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.330 
know how to work them properly and a lot
of<00:02:28.959> them<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.410> tell<00:02:29.440> probably<00:02:29.950> bought<00:02:30.160> them

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
of them I can tell probably bought them

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
of them I can tell probably bought them
because<00:02:30.610> they<00:02:30.790> work<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:31.599> when<00:02:31.810> they

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
because they work at the time when they

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.540 
because they work at the time when they
first<00:02:32.080> came<00:02:32.260> out<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.530> most<00:02:32.739> distorted<00:02:33.159> amps

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
first came out the most distorted amps

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.119 
first came out the most distorted amps
you<00:02:33.640> can<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.180> were<00:02:34.239> inspired<00:02:34.930> by<00:02:35.290> Eddie

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
you can get they were inspired by Eddie

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.729 
you can get they were inspired by Eddie

Van Halen's enormous sound thing is the

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.900 
Van Halen's enormous sound thing is the
reason<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.129> Eddie<00:02:39.370> Van

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
reason that Eddie Van

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.760 
reason that Eddie Van
was<00:02:40.060> able<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.480> get<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> sound<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.290> he<00:02:41.410> got<00:02:41.590> at

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
was able to get the sound that he got at

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.560 
was able to get the sound that he got at
the<00:02:41.920> time<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.340> he<00:02:42.430> got<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.760> before<00:02:43.210> super

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
the time that he got it before super

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.830 
the time that he got it before super
high<00:02:43.720> gain<00:02:43.990> amps<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:45.670> he<00:02:46.090> knew<00:02:46.390> how<00:02:46.780> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
high gain amps is because he knew how to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.630 
high gain amps is because he knew how to
work<00:02:47.080> two<00:02:47.290> games<00:02:47.560> he<00:02:47.710> understood<00:02:48.250> them<00:02:48.460> he

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
work two games he understood them he

work two games he understood them he
knew<00:02:48.850> what<00:02:49.030> made<00:02:49.210> them<00:02:49.420> tick<00:02:50.010> sadly<00:02:51.010> most

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
knew what made them tick sadly most

knew what made them tick sadly most
people<00:02:51.340> these<00:02:51.730> days<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:52.300> not<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:53.440> thing<00:02:53.680> about

for you here
this<00:03:15.340> will<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:16.000> about<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.630> appreciation

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
this will be all about the appreciation

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.590 
this will be all about the appreciation
of<00:03:17.620> tube<00:03:17.980> amps<00:03:18.310> I've<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> few<00:03:19.330> on<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.480> list

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
of tube amps I've got a few on the list

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.900 
of tube amps I've got a few on the list
here<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.320> we're<00:03:20.890> gonna<00:03:20.950> break<00:03:21.250> them<00:03:21.430> down<00:03:21.460> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
here and we're gonna break them down and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.480 
here and we're gonna break them down and
see<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:22.690> they<00:03:22.810> can<00:03:23.020> do<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.950> since<00:03:24.160> some<00:03:24.340> of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
see what they can do but since some of

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.620 
see what they can do but since some of
them<00:03:24.580> are<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:24.790> versatile<00:03:25.210> I'm<00:03:25.300> going<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.510> work

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
them are so versatile I'm going to work

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.880 
them are so versatile I'm going to work
in<00:03:25.780> sections<00:03:26.050> here<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.470> I'm<00:03:26.620> not<00:03:26.770> necessarily

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
in sections here and I'm not necessarily

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.080 
in sections here and I'm not necessarily
going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.340> be<00:03:27.400> doing<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:27.730> on<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.910> regular

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
going to be doing this on a regular

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
going to be doing this on a regular
basis<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.930> will<00:03:29.110> be<00:03:29.260> more<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:29.920> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
basis so this will be more of a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.440 
basis so this will be more of a
miniseries<00:03:30.580> than<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.330> regular<00:03:31.780> show<00:03:33.300> but<00:03:34.300> we

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
miniseries than a regular show but we

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.880 
miniseries than a regular show but we
are<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.840> go<00:03:34.990> through<00:03:35.290> quite<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.680> few

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
are going to go through quite a few

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.980 
are going to go through quite a few
things<00:03:36.070> here<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.580> think<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.630> should<00:03:37.840> get

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990
