00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
stimulation the treatments not only

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.339 
stimulation the treatments not only
corrective<00:00:24.669> but<00:00:25.000> it's<00:00:25.149> also<00:00:25.450> going<00:00:25.989> to<00:00:26.140> be

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
corrective but it's also going to be

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
getting worse in the future so it's very

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.970 
getting worse in the future so it's very
versatile<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.450> it<00:00:31.989> does<00:00:32.200> give<00:00:32.470> people<00:00:32.890> a

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
the nasolabial folds and Terry's had a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.330 
the nasolabial folds and Terry's had a
numbing<00:00:52.720> cream<00:00:53.079> on<00:00:53.230> for<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.560> past<00:00:53.710> 20<00:00:54.160> minutes

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
numbing cream on for the past 20 minutes

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.390 
numbing cream on for the past 20 minutes
which<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.790> about<00:00:54.970> average<00:00:55.210> for<00:00:55.480> people<00:00:56.400> she'll

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
which is about average for people she'll

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.979 
which is about average for people she'll
still<00:00:57.640> feel<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.880> little<00:00:57.970> bit<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.329> pressure<00:00:58.630> but

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
still feel a little bit of pressure but

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.200 
still feel a little bit of pressure but
she<00:00:59.200> you<00:00:59.620> shouldn't<00:00:59.980> feel<00:01:00.010> too<00:01:00.160> much<00:01:00.579> pinching

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
she you shouldn't feel too much pinching

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.639 
she you shouldn't feel too much pinching
so<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.570> should<00:01:01.780> be<00:01:01.810> a<00:01:01.930> very<00:01:02.020> comfortable

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
so it should be a very comfortable

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.219 
so it should be a very comfortable
experience<00:01:02.980> for<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:04.119> injection<00:01:04.839> part<00:01:05.110> of

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
experience for you the injection part of

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.480 
experience for you the injection part of
the<00:01:05.350> treatment<00:01:05.590> probably<00:01:06.130> takes<00:01:06.340> about

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
the treatment probably takes about

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.969 
the treatment probably takes about
another<00:01:06.939> 20<00:01:07.509> minutes<00:01:07.810> or<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.500> I<00:01:08.530> would<00:01:08.800> say

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
another 20 minutes or so so I would say

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.040 
another 20 minutes or so so I would say

we can be sure that the patient has had

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.870 
we can be sure that the patient has had
maximum<00:01:49.960> correction<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:50.979> add<00:01:51.159> another

maximum correction and add another

maximum correction and add another
syringe<00:01:52.299> or<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:53.049> we<00:01:53.200> need<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.979> from
