yes<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.059> had<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> good<00:00:09.480> start<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.789> believe

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
yes we had a good start and I believe

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.749 
yes we had a good start and I believe
all<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.589> very<00:00:13.589> intense<00:00:14.039> game<00:00:14.459> between

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
all it was a very intense game between

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.390 
all it was a very intense game between
two<00:00:15.150> very<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.509> teams<00:00:16.100> where<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.220> had<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
two very good teams where you had to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.620 
two very good teams where you had to
fight<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:17.789> every<00:00:18.240> boy<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.960> focused<00:00:19.760> I<00:00:20.760> felt

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fight for every boy to be focused I felt

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.920 
fight for every boy to be focused I felt
that<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.990> had<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.140> good<00:00:22.350> combination<00:00:22.680> between

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
that we had a good combination between

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.500 
that we had a good combination between
our<00:00:24.930> usual<00:00:25.500> game<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.130> passing<00:00:26.580> game<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.120> on

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
our usual game of a passing game and on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.029 
our usual game of a passing game and on
transition<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.560> defense<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> attack<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:31.039> we

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
transition from defense to attack and we

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.979 
transition from defense to attack and we
were<00:00:32.189> highly<00:00:32.610> focused<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.450> defend<00:00:33.809> well

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
were highly focused to defend well

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
were highly focused to defend well
together<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> first<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.130> last<00:00:35.220> minute

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
together from a first to the last minute

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.080 
together from a first to the last minute
and<00:00:36.140> overall<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.640> we<00:00:38.640> looked<00:00:38.820> always

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and overall I think we looked always

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.650 
and overall I think we looked always
dangerous<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.680> were<00:00:41.060> defensively<00:00:42.060> as<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
dangerous and we were defensively as a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.460 
dangerous and we were defensively as a
team<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.320> were<00:00:43.470> very<00:00:43.950> good<00:00:44.870> more<00:00:45.870> impressive

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
team we were very good more impressive

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.010 
team we were very good more impressive
results<00:00:47.160> given<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.360> preceded<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
results given the three that preceded it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.580 
results given the three that preceded it
starts<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.190> stratify<00:00:50.520> even<00:00:50.940> harder<00:00:51.440> look<00:00:52.440> we

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
starts to stratify even harder look we

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
starts to stratify even harder look we
were<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.860> done<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.370> under<00:00:53.610> pressure<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
were be done the more under pressure you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
were be done the more under pressure you
know<00:00:54.540> because<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> fell<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.190> Saturday<00:00:58.160> we

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
played well but maybe were a victim a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.999 
played well but maybe were a victim a
little<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.110> our<00:01:04.290> generous<00:01:04.799> attitude

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
little bit of our generous attitude

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.160 
little bit of our generous attitude
going<00:01:05.670> forward<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.310> tonight<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.580> we

going forward and tonight because we
give<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> bit<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.930> must<00:01:12.930> say<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.620> a<00:01:13.650> bit

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
give a bit more I must say had a bit

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.730 
give a bit more I must say had a bit
more<00:01:14.100> urgency<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> defend<00:01:15.620> especially<00:01:16.620> when

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
more urgency to defend especially when

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.969 
more urgency to defend especially when
you're<00:01:16.920> warning<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:20.869> come<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.440> focus<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you're warning up come from the focus of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.980 
you're warning up come from the focus of
that<00:01:23.190> other<00:01:23.460> party<00:01:24.030> doesn't<00:01:24.060> riding<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> very

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that other party doesn't riding a very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.840 
that other party doesn't riding a very
different<00:01:26.630> look<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> talk<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> think

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
different look the talk about it I think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
different look the talk about it I think
the<00:01:32.850> difference<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.390> football<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> big

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the difference in football in the big

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.859 
the difference in football in the big
games<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.220> being<00:01:35.580> one<00:01:35.790> nil<00:01:36.030> upon<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.510> is<00:01:36.659> down

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
games is being one nil upon one is down

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
games is being one nil upon one is down
you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> have

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you know when you one is down you have

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
you know when you one is down you have
to<00:01:39.570> change<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> game<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.700> sometimes<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to change the game and sometimes you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460 
to change the game and sometimes you
want<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.150> much<00:01:42.330> especially<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.080> control

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
want so much especially when you control

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.789 
want so much especially when you control
the<00:01:43.650> game<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:44.400> on<00:01:44.490> Saturday<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
the game like we did on Saturday if you

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
the game like we did on Saturday if you
last<00:01:49.799> Saturday<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.460> had<00:01:50.549> 60<00:01:51.030> penalty<00:01:51.479> area

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
last Saturday we had 60 penalty area

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.890 
last Saturday we had 60 penalty area
entries<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:55.310> Manchester<00:01:56.310> 988<00:01:56.790> 17<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.750> were

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
entries and Manchester 988 17 so we were

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.109 
entries and Manchester 988 17 so we were
always<00:01:58.080> forward<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.610> risk<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
always forward but the the risk you have

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
always forward but the the risk you have
when<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> run<00:02:00.930> after<00:02:01.140> goal<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> what

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
when you have to run after goal is what

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.460 
when you have to run after goal is what
you<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.220> caught<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> break<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.470> tonight

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
you get caught on the break and tonight

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.230 
you get caught on the break and tonight
we<00:02:04.650> were<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.040> different<00:02:05.240> tactical

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we were in a different tactical

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.520 
we were in a different tactical
situation

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
situation

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.380 
situation
consecutive<00:02:09.399> qualifications<00:02:10.179> for<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
consecutive qualifications for the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.570 
consecutive qualifications for the
second<00:02:10.750> round<00:02:10.869> what<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.010> say<00:02:12.160> about<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
second round what can you say about the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.710 
second round what can you say about the
level<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.959> achievement<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.530> think

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
level of of that achievement I think

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.300 
level of of that achievement I think
when<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.870> work<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> Football<00:02:17.830> Club<00:02:18.069> you

when you work in the Football Club you

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.710 
when you work in the Football Club you
will<00:02:19.060> realize<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.270> easy

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
will realize that it's not it's not easy

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.900

deserves a lot of credit for that it's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.350 
deserves a lot of credit for that it's
not<00:02:35.200> enough<00:02:35.500> because<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.670> want<00:02:36.850> more<00:02:37.180> than
