now here's one I prepared earlier put
two<00:01:02.920> low<00:01:03.129> broad<00:01:03.339> joints<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:04.299> hand<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
two low broad joints one hand it's a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800 
two low broad joints one hand it's a
little<00:01:06.010> bit<00:01:06.130> fiddly<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.490> bolt<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:07.000> but<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.750> is

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
little bit fiddly to bolt in but this is

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.970 
little bit fiddly to bolt in but this is
where<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.200> goes<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.750> there<00:01:11.200> between<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
where it goes in there between the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.080 
where it goes in there between the
differential<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.940> rear<00:01:13.120> hub<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:15.090> slot

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
already fitted the rear brake disc we've

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.440 
already fitted the rear brake disc we've
cleaned<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.470> up<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.770> brake<00:01:45.040> cleaner<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.790> now

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
cleaned it up with brake cleaner and now

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.980 
cleaned it up with brake cleaner and now
we're<00:01:46.630> about<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.840> put<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.140> caliper<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
fitted in slip it over the disc a couple

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.899 
fitted in slip it over the disc a couple
of<00:01:56.680> Allen<00:01:56.920> bolts<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:59.020> from<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.440> back<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.670> hold

that is bolting it up on it's great not

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.280 
that is bolting it up on it's great not
fully<00:02:38.000> tight<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.610> we'll<00:02:43.760> take<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.230> all<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
fully tight and we'll take that all the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.800 
fully tight and we'll take that all the
way<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.640> stick<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.180> through<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.420> bracket

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
way up and stick it through the bracket

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.580 
way up and stick it through the bracket
in<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.959> chassis<00:02:48.230> they're<00:02:49.630> sticking<00:02:50.630> nut<00:02:50.780> on

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.750 

now<00:02:54.590> finally<00:02:55.070> tighten<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.459> up<00:02:55.520> with<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
now finally tighten that up with a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.420 
now finally tighten that up with a
spanner<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.690> then<00:02:56.810> as<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.080> can<00:02:57.230> see<00:02:57.430> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
spanner and then as you can see the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.170 
spanner and then as you can see the
steel<00:02:58.700> brake<00:02:58.970> pipe<00:02:59.209> then<00:02:59.480> goes<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.900> top<00:03:00.140> white

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.979 

so<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.239> there<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.630> it

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
so all there is to it

so all there is to it
Nick<00:03:06.560> thing<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.920> do<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.730> handbrake<00:03:09.400> sit

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
Nick thing to do is the handbrake sit

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.960 
Nick thing to do is the handbrake sit
nicely<00:03:10.700> attached<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.580> brake<00:03:13.820> mechanism

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
nicely attached here and brake mechanism

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.660 
nicely attached here and brake mechanism
works<00:03:14.570> through<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.110> rod<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.070> cable<00:03:16.549> and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
works through this rod to the cable and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.090 
works through this rod to the cable and
the<00:03:17.090> cable<00:03:17.120> whens<00:03:17.840> its<00:03:18.110> way<00:03:18.320> all<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.070> way

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
the cable whens its way all the way

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the cable whens its way all the way
around<00:03:19.519> here<00:03:22.840> right<00:03:23.840> around<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.170> back<00:03:24.350> down
