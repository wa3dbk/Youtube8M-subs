00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.360
 two 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.340
 good as they are I hope very well the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.260
 ounce video debating an issue of 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.349
 which I want to talk about quite a lot and this 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.750
 is what happened to bridge that the anime 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.060
 ends up being canceled in the series 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.460
 every time he followed more down he lost his 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.160
 meaning and good and to know what happened to him 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.050
 The lecce started very well but after and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.910
 now the manga if you were autoenmano 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 well luckily it has built a 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:39.000
 little but focuses on what happened in the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.000
 2008 2009 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.719
 I fell in love at first sight 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.579
 these two years he does not understand anything 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.469
 I mean, I'm really excited about this 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.750
 anime could not stop the chapter after 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.820
 chapter and I was not the only one because the 2 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.039
 himself exercised an anime convention and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.800
 I got really tired cosplayers disguised 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.660
 of ydanis and even review a fight 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.190
 between majority and serve in this video that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.730
 I have saved from 2009 they are not going to 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.730
 to believe 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 you can clearly see that people 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 I was fascinated with bleach but not all 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.530
 is rose the series started to 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 move forward and the skill came against that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.930
 even the swords all that was all 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.670
 all right 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.980
 the guy verse fed it I think the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.350
 most liked but one day forget 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.690
 for his eyes in the fight so inspired 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.010
 so epic at the beginning it was very good 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.239
 but later when we saw a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.239
 divestment potter flip 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.760
 I have to always be the best but 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.069
 even the rat as the bridge author 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 and start hitting him but hey still 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.209
 I had faith in the series nothing happens 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.650
 let's continue seeing the thought but it was coming 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.690
 quite art not because of inconsistencies 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.040
 but because for each thing declared a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.870
 filling and we support you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.940
 strong fillings like the low 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 that lasted cheating or those risks that 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 They appear out of nowhere for example boy 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.310
 is fighting with me rage and blow 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.750
 filling without warning from nowhere so 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.030
 unless you have to also a saga 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
 I said in a saga rules I do not believe in those 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.410
 Things should when against life 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.780
 pita contradict finished the series return 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.700
 there we have a boy without powers very 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.890
 delayed lamas and acrobats who from 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.540
 Naruto I fear it was and the saga appeared 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.329
 of the full runners that for many was 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.459
 one more filling but it was not long 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.470
 official and I think that that was what 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.090
 he made the cross habilis because this saga 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.620
 practically nobody liked it if I did not 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.629
 create bands in some bleach forum 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.370
 cullen of the full bringer if you are going to see 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.750
 that most of the criticisms are 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.540
 negative and 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.400
 in Japan this made the ranking of 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.380
 very much if we are we could take what 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.510
 liquidity level also maternity 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.830
 colour 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.080
 and well the end of this saga was the 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.520
 official funeral of the pich after the 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.110
 series continues the manga the truth is that 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.940
 at the beginning that are very loose would be 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.280
 with the negative reviews apart is 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.480
 like that one came resentful of the anime and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.100
 just then I can say that the manga 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.020
 recovered a good level and the truth is 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.120
 quite entertaining but good then 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.709
 Let's review everything I said is 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.270
 had an excellent start but the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.829
 fillings destroyed it too 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.510
 inconsistencies like all fats that 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.010
 they put ichigo power at 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.780
 absurdities like for example defeat of 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.490
 Friday gillian and that I have thousands of 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.740
 years I smell of anger I do not think that three 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.419
 training days something like that one thing 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.250
 that does not mention the official freckles 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.230
 that are very short and spanair weapons 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.700
 long then a fight a capable kingdom 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.140
 that was much longer water doubtable 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.300
 years as in payments are from the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.610
 just camp so you can the conclusion 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.680
 that we have to take out that a filling in 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.960
 inconsistencies are two things that can 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.630
 destroy a yolk and still nothing too 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.130
 a lucid one on this path I do not know the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.110
 true the filling is done was using 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.240
 and I do not know if it was the manga 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.490
 since he was arming himself they are incredible 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.290
 to share your opinion they started 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.420
 as I liked very much bills to the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.880
 beginning and then they noticed this fall 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.400
 that he had always liked and no hands 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.470
 all are blige celebrities 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.990
 not even I am control my favor for 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.940
 say that the line was always perfect 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.130
 handsome never created hear that from 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.320
 central but good tell me what they think 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.700
 of bridge anime that would be all for 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.940
 what a lot of thanks for watching this 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.940
 video
