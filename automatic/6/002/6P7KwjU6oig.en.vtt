more dried full fluffy look and one
thing<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> say<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.540> hair<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
thing I can say about this hair is that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.730 
thing I can say about this hair is that
once<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> dries<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.670> does<00:01:57.259> fluff<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> little

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
once it dries it does fluff up a little

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.700 
once it dries it does fluff up a little
bit<00:01:58.920> which<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> like<00:02:00.170> as<00:02:01.170> far<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
bit which is what I like as far as the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.889 
bit which is what I like as far as the
cons<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.490> did<00:02:02.909> seal<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.570> lips<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.140> still<00:02:04.649> have

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.130 
cons I did seal my lips but I still have
shedding<00:02:06.899> not<00:02:07.849> crazy<00:02:08.849> shedding<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.660> still

could have possibly blend it but it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.259 
could have possibly blend it but it
would<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.530> been<00:03:13.620> more<00:03:14.400> work<00:03:14.670> than<00:03:14.940> what<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
