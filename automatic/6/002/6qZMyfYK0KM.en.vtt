so<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.880> highly<00:00:09.540> MVM<00:00:10.230> focused<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> let's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so it's highly MVM focused so let's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.289 
so it's highly MVM focused so let's
start<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.530> first<00:00:13.740> city<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.580> Manhattan<00:00:15.089> is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
lose a fourth of it so if you jumped

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.539 
lose a fourth of it so if you jumped
white<00:02:44.230> double<00:02:44.620> jump<00:02:44.799> once<00:02:45.010> see<00:02:45.310> there's<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
white double jump once see there's a

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.240 
white double jump once see there's a
fourth<00:02:45.790> double<00:02:46.419> jump<00:02:46.629> four<00:02:46.900> times<00:02:47.169> thus<00:02:47.709> hey

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
fourth double jump four times thus hey

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.039 
fourth double jump four times thus hey
jumps<00:02:48.669> then<00:02:49.030> you'll<00:02:49.239> lose<00:02:49.419> all<00:02:49.599> your<00:02:49.659> boost

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
jumps then you'll lose all your boost

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.220 
jumps then you'll lose all your boost
you<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.799> gain<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.549> lot<00:02:51.879> faster<00:02:52.239> getting<00:02:53.139> a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
you can also gain a lot faster getting a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.559 
you can also gain a lot faster getting a
boost<00:02:53.409> thought<00:02:53.620> fast<00:02:53.919> and<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.879> no<00:02:55.090> boost<00:02:55.389> you

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
boost thought fast and with no boost you

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.349 
boost thought fast and with no boost you
actually<00:02:55.870> go<00:02:56.019> decent<00:02:56.709> speed<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.310> slow<00:02:58.000> ass

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
actually go decent speed not slow ass

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.159 
actually go decent speed not slow ass
like<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.409> used<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:01.169> rocket

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
like you used to and then the rocket

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.839 
like you used to and then the rocket
that<00:03:02.560> what's<00:03:02.709> called<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> liberty<00:03:03.609> watcher

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
that what's called the liberty watcher

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.740 
that what's called the liberty watcher
there<00:03:04.000> we<00:03:04.090> go<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:06.639> more<00:03:06.969> rocket<00:03:07.389> jump<00:03:07.599> read

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
there we go now is more rocket jump read

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.220 
there we go now is more rocket jump read
there<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.310> les<00:03:09.969> temps<00:03:10.239> rocket<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.989> paired

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
there so like les temps rocket I paired

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.099 
there so like les temps rocket I paired
it<00:03:11.319> with<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:12.000> gunboats<00:03:13.000> which<00:03:13.239> reduces<00:03:13.629> the

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
it with the gunboats which reduces the

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.550 
it with the gunboats which reduces the
damage<00:03:14.290> tinker<00:03:14.769> markets<00:03:15.069> from<00:03:15.189> to<00:03:15.639> like<00:03:15.790> 10<00:03:16.560> HP

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
damage tinker markets from to like 10 HP

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.830 
damage tinker markets from to like 10 HP
I<00:03:18.159> guess<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.760> lose<00:03:18.849> 10<00:03:19.120> HP<00:03:19.329> every<00:03:19.569> time<00:03:19.720> you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
I guess you lose 10 HP every time you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.439 
I guess you lose 10 HP every time you
like<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.109> don't<00:03:20.229> which<00:03:20.379> is<00:03:20.470> kind<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.310> us<00:03:21.489> and

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
like I don't which is kind of us and

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.289 
like I don't which is kind of us and
there's<00:03:22.989> also<00:03:23.229> some<00:03:23.500> thing<00:03:23.979> else<00:03:24.159> in<00:03:24.940> be<00:03:25.209> on

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
there's also some thing else in be on

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.349 
there's also some thing else in be on
screen<00:03:25.540> whatever<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.500> overall<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.819> update

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
screen whatever and overall this update

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.390

was<00:03:28.720> all<00:03:29.019> right<00:03:29.439> I<00:03:29.470> guess<00:03:29.650> I'm<00:03:29.949> not<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
was all right I guess I'm not really a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.280 
was all right I guess I'm not really a
big<00:03:30.549> fan<00:03:30.609> of<00:03:30.790> nvm<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.569> didn't<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.079> too

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
