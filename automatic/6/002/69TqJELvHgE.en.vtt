00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.110
 No, because the information I have 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.940
 over the chip at the lahn with the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.070
 asymmetric rocker training at the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.990
 outside let me on the skis her 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.439
 be curious to prove that really 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.330
 feel while driving yes let me 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.330
 surprise explains more suffice 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.739
 in the category snow had at the video 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.340
 a distribution of 90 percent on the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.199
 slope and about 20% in the terrain encourage 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.269
 player with very after pastors is but 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.769
 also very close to the piste 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.769
 pleasant to drive moderately 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.060
 Starting from the advanced level 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.160
 to the experts you will find here 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.020
 a very good stable ski 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 simply by the smooth running and by the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.120
 necessity stands in cross section 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.109
 with further radii here are the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.390
 Fields of application between coming 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.740
 that are in the area quite as too 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 home from the elan and video 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.370
 before he has for the schnitzel or 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.350
 shows up to our plan on the video 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.070
 the video he is just with this 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.830
 asymmetrical rocker own ways 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.060
 feature in the first moment actually do 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.000
 she does not really know 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.980
 like a very normal very sporty too 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.480
 drive and had very high smoothness 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 I notice, however, the fast 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.160
 swing meckel or even if it something 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.270
 restless from the piste so he 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.340
 much easier 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 enter that for the classic where 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.320
 then just the advantages of the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 rock cafÃ© and definitely show 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.440
 who finds advanced to Cologne 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.030
 definitely the right ski here 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.680
 mainly for those who are still easy 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.260
 but want to drive classic 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 also a relieved other or more 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.860
 just want to enjoy it 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.680
 the store here with this asymmetric 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.680
 shovel offers a lot of fun with it and well
