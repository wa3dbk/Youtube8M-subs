00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
impressions of this map so let me just

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.430 
impressions of this map so let me just
say<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.140> map<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.850> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> tall<00:00:43.260> did

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
say this map is like kind of a tall did

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.150 
say this map is like kind of a tall did
it<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.700> cool<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.620> strikes<00:00:46.920> me

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it can be cool but with what strikes me

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.970 
it can be cool but with what strikes me
a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.530> sides<00:00:50.000> overly<00:00:51.000> wide

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
a lot is that the sides overly wide

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.819 
a lot is that the sides overly wide
which<00:00:52.980> means<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.520> people<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.210> flank<00:00:54.829> really

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
which means that people can flank really

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
which means that people can flank really
easily<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:58.680> cover<00:00:59.239> now<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> want

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
easily and with cover now if you want

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
easily and with cover now if you want
boy<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.469> app<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.510> block<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:05.090> what's<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.150> a

for<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.509> basically<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.219> guy's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for them basically as you see this guy's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
for them basically as you see this guy's
trying<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.850> escape<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
trying to escape from the you know

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
trying to escape from the you know
middle<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> might<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.149> double<00:02:06.600> XP

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
middle and I think it might be double XP

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.390 
middle and I think it might be double XP
I<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:10.039> yeah

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I don't really know about that and yeah

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.140 
I don't really know about that and yeah
so<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:13.049> what<00:02:13.230> else<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.620> say<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so what what else can I say I like the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.970 
so what what else can I say I like the
environment<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.049> stamp<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.470> guess<00:02:16.739> it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
environment of the stamp I guess it

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.009 
environment of the stamp I guess it
means<00:02:17.159> it's<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.819> lot<00:02:18.000> more<00:02:18.030> unique<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.689> this

of cool but there's a lot of unnecessary

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.330 
of cool but there's a lot of unnecessary

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
me I don't really know why that's it and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.640 
me I don't really know why that's it and
in<00:02:29.879> this<00:02:30.239> match<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.689> do<00:02:30.750> play<00:02:30.989> objective<00:02:31.470> law

in this match I do play objective law

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.240 
in this match I do play objective law

they're<00:02:38.609> doing<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.810> really<00:02:40.109> think<00:02:40.260> that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
they're doing it and I really think that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.039 
they're doing it and I really think that
works<00:02:40.650> exhibition<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:42.390> before<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:42.780> leave

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
works exhibition just before they leave

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.500 
works exhibition just before they leave
people<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:44.159> if<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.849> spending<00:02:45.120> money

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
people because if we're spending money

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.930 
people because if we're spending money
they<00:02:45.959> should<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.379> get<00:02:46.620> some<00:02:46.950> extra<00:02:47.250> stuff<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
they should we get some extra stuff and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.819 
they should we get some extra stuff and
I<00:02:48.659> think<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.079> works<00:02:49.319> me<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.220> good<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
I think that works me would be good and

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.300 
I think that works me would be good and
the<00:02:53.329> whatever<00:02:54.329> they<00:02:54.450> called<00:02:55.099> but<00:02:56.099> now<00:02:56.250> you

buttons are supposed to be small so the

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.260

more<00:05:31.200> accurate<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:32.099> they<00:05:32.760> should<00:05:32.969> be<00:05:33.060> less

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
more accurate and they should be less

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
a mannequin hall with clay moles to get

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.230 
a mannequin hall with clay moles to get
my<00:06:53.230> killstreaks<00:06:53.500> cuz<00:06:54.460> mannequin<00:06:54.970> home

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
the mat and to the side of the map of a

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.960 
the mat and to the side of the map of a
flank<00:07:00.580> route<00:07:00.790> so<00:07:01.500> basically<00:07:02.500> you<00:07:03.400> had<00:07:03.610> one

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
flank route so basically you had one

flank route so basically you had one
flank<00:07:04.330> on<00:07:04.540> the<00:07:04.930> other<00:07:05.080> side<00:07:05.380> of<00:07:05.410> the<00:07:05.530> map<00:07:05.710> that

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
flank on the other side of the map that

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.670 
flank on the other side of the map that
could<00:07:06.250> come<00:07:06.490> out<00:07:06.730> and<00:07:07.660> try<00:07:07.960> to<00:07:08.020> get<00:07:08.380> the<00:07:08.500> back

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 
could come out and try to get the back

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.440 
could come out and try to get the back
from<00:07:09.010> you<00:07:09.190> but<00:07:09.400> you<00:07:09.610> had<00:07:09.790> coupled<00:07:10.210> the<00:07:10.300> back

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
from you but you had coupled the back

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.420

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
and then you had a number one that could

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.520 
and then you had a number one that could
do<00:07:12.580> know<00:07:12.910> Frank<00:07:13.330> without<00:07:13.540> coming<00:07:14.050> to<00:07:14.290> you
