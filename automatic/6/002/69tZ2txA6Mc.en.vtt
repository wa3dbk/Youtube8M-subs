00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
update on the DJ eye light bridge it's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.550 
update on the DJ eye light bridge it's
got<00:00:12.809> approximately<00:00:14.480> 1.2<00:00:15.480> miles<00:00:15.780> over<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
got approximately 1.2 miles over one and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.660 
got approximately 1.2 miles over one and
a<00:00:16.619> half<00:00:16.710> miles<00:00:17.570> 1.7<00:00:18.570> something<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.670> but

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
a half miles 1.7 something like that but

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
a half miles 1.7 something like that but
if<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.910> really<00:00:21.539> want<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
if you really want to get out there you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.570 
if you really want to get out there you
can<00:00:23.039> put<00:00:23.220> these<00:00:23.480> individual<00:00:24.480> 2<00:00:25.140> watt<00:00:25.580> 2.4

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
can put these individual 2 watt 2.4

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
can put these individual 2 watt 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:26.760> boosters<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.220> got<00:00:29.220> them

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
gigahertz boosters on there I got them

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.870 
gigahertz boosters on there I got them
from<00:00:29.840> infinity<00:00:30.840> hobby<00:00:31.050> about<00:00:31.679> forty<00:00:32.009> nine

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
from infinity hobby about forty nine

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.110 
from infinity hobby about forty nine
dollars<00:00:33.239> apiece<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:35.790> wire<00:00:35.969> them

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
dollars apiece and you wire them

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.690 
dollars apiece and you wire them
together<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
together and have one you have to have a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.330 
together and have one you have to have a
step-down<00:00:41.719> transformer<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.110> takes

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
step-down transformer because it takes

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
step-down transformer because it takes
maximum<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.520> five<00:00:44.700> point<00:00:45.059> five<00:00:45.239> volts<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
maximum of five point five volts and I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
maximum of five point five volts and I
think<00:00:47.489> four<00:00:47.730> point<00:00:48.059> seven<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.379> minimum<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
think four point seven is the minimum I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.389 
think four point seven is the minimum I
would<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> read<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.500> manual<00:00:52.500> again

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
would have to read the manual again

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
would have to read the manual again
actually<00:00:54.000> they're<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> manual<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.719> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
actually they're not a manual it's very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
actually they're not a manual it's very
hard<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> find<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.620> information<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
hard to find the information but it is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090 
hard to find the information but it is
on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> computer<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.530> their<00:00:58.649> website

working<00:01:05.510> it's<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.869> blue<00:01:06.990> light<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
working it's got a little blue light you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.740 
working it's got a little blue light you
have<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> turn<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> light<00:01:09.030> bridge<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
have to turn on the light bridge I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.010 
have to turn on the light bridge I
thought<00:01:10.260> there<00:01:10.439> were<00:01:10.530> defective<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.040> first

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
thought there were defective at first

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
thought there were defective at first
but<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> turn<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> light<00:01:13.740> bridge<00:01:14.299> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
but if you turn on the light bridge and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.870 
but if you turn on the light bridge and
then<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:15.659> power<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.520> you'll<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.670> little

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
then put power to them you'll get little

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.410 
then put power to them you'll get little

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
whatever it's called it really want to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320 
whatever it's called it really want to
unplug<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.470> battery<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:07.160> these<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.790> drops<00:02:08.149> in

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
unplug the battery to these it drops in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.240 
unplug the battery to these it drops in
half<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.259> supposed<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.649> double<00:02:10.040> your

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
half this is supposed to double your

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.180 
half this is supposed to double your
output<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> if<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.710> go<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.830> mile<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.160> a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
output so if you can go a mile and a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.520 
output so if you can go a mile and a
half<00:02:13.310> or<00:02:14.120> without<00:02:14.660> them<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.260> three

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
half or without them you can go three

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.520 
half or without them you can go three
miles<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.950> them<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.550> it's<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.180> big<00:02:17.360> difference

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
miles with them so it's a big difference

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.980 
miles with them so it's a big difference
I<00:02:18.560> hope<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.460> helps<00:02:19.820> y'all<00:02:20.180> get<00:02:20.660> out<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> little

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
I hope this helps y'all get out a little

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.280 
I hope this helps y'all get out a little
