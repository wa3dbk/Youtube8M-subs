00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
know that's up to him but I'd rather I'd

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.650 
know that's up to him but I'd rather I'd
rather<00:02:40.730> keep<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.150> between<00:02:41.239> us<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.629> don't

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
rather keep that between us I don't

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.869 
rather keep that between us I don't
think<00:02:41.959> there's<00:02:42.170> there's<00:02:42.440> any<00:02:42.560> point<00:02:42.879> really

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
think there's there's any point really

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.729 
think there's there's any point really
starting<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.299> but<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.930> know<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.080> was

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
starting that but you know I was

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.610 
starting that but you know I was
surprising<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.610> didn't<00:02:46.849> like<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:51.019> think

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
surprising and I didn't like it I think

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.949 
surprising and I didn't like it I think
it<00:02:51.709> always<00:02:51.829> has<00:02:52.069> been<00:02:52.099> I<00:02:52.459> mean<00:02:52.730> we've<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.930> know

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
it always has been I mean we've you know

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.559 
it always has been I mean we've you know
seen<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> Rangers<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.160> playoffs<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.790> see

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
seen the Rangers in the playoffs and see

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.759 
seen the Rangers in the playoffs and see
them<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.780> lot<00:02:56.900> during<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.260> year<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.440> used<00:02:57.680> to

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
them a lot during the year you used to

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.780 
them a lot during the year you used to
play<00:02:57.860> them<00:02:58.069> eight<00:02:58.190> times<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.579> year<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:58.930> I<00:03:00.790> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
play them eight times a year so I I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.490 
play them eight times a year so I I
don't<00:03:02.150> see<00:03:02.420> there<00:03:02.660> any<00:03:02.810> reason<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.470> i

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
don't see there any reason not to be i

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.009 
don't see there any reason not to be i
mean<00:03:03.709> it's<00:03:04.130> it's<00:03:04.549> intense<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:05.810> always

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
mean it's it's intense and they always

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.259 
mean it's it's intense and they always
play<00:03:06.200> well<00:03:06.410> especially<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.150> they

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
play well especially here you know they

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.479 
play well especially here you know they
 really<00:03:08.660> hard<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.860> know<00:03:09.920> tonight<00:03:10.250> was

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
 really hard so you know tonight was

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.150 
 really hard so you know tonight was
a<00:03:10.730> very<00:03:11.209> example<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.110> physical<00:03:12.290> game<00:03:12.680> and

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
a very example of a physical game and

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.150 
a very example of a physical game and
one<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.610> two<00:03:13.849> teams<00:03:14.090> wanted<00:03:15.040> difficult<00:03:16.040> at

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
one that two teams wanted difficult at

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.009 
one that two teams wanted difficult at
all<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.579> come<00:03:16.819> off<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.019> emotion

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
all for you to come off the emotion

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.500 
all for you to come off the emotion
while<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:18.410> went<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.329> olympics<00:03:20.329> i'll

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
while they went on the olympics i'll

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.480 
while they went on the olympics i'll
come<00:03:20.630> back<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.079> each<00:03:21.170> other

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
come back to the in each other

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.920 
come back to the in each other
probably<00:03:23.490> doesn't<00:03:23.820> make<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.510> easier<00:03:24.780> when

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
probably doesn't make it easier when

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510 
probably doesn't make it easier when
there's<00:03:25.110> games<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.860> know<00:03:26.040> it's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
there's games like this you know it's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.950 
there's games like this you know it's
intense<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:28.740> last<00:03:29.280> game<00:03:29.520> was<00:03:29.930> was<00:03:30.930> a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
intense and you know last game was was a

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.450 
intense and you know last game was was a
guy<00:03:31.110> i<00:03:31.140> mean<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.440> everybody<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.070> coming<00:03:32.340> off

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
guy i mean we everybody was coming off

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.800 
guy i mean we everybody was coming off
the<00:03:32.610> brake<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.970> probably<00:03:33.300> didn't<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.600> that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the brake it probably didn't have that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.440 
the brake it probably didn't have that
same<00:03:34.050> intensity<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.740> tonight<00:03:35.040> tonight<00:03:35.550> was

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
same intensity but tonight tonight was

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.600 
same intensity but tonight tonight was
