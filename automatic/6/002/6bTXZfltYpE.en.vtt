it<00:00:34.160> doesn't<00:00:34.519> look<00:00:34.699> like<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.940> typical<00:00:35.180> balloon

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
it doesn't look like a typical balloon

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.780 
it doesn't look like a typical balloon
we<00:00:36.080> filmed<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.530> lot<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:36.739> them<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.250> I'll<00:00:37.519> break<00:00:37.699> it

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
we filmed a lot of them so I'll break it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.939 
we filmed a lot of them so I'll break it
down<00:00:37.820> here<00:00:38.180> lower<00:00:38.449> right<00:00:38.750> very<00:00:39.410> quick<00:00:39.739> little

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
down here lower right very quick little

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.850 
down here lower right very quick little
black<00:00:40.250> object<00:00:40.790> there<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.320> here<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.500> slowed

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
black object there and here it is slowed

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.950 
black object there and here it is slowed
down<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.190> bit<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.699> centered<00:00:44.150> up<00:00:44.330> higher<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.629> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
down a bit and centered up higher on the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.289 
down a bit and centered up higher on the
screen<00:00:45.229> so<00:00:45.409> you<00:00:45.440> get<00:00:45.650> a<00:00:45.680> better<00:00:45.890> view<00:00:46.280> all<00:00:46.909> the

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
screen so you get a better view all the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.479 
screen so you get a better view all the
movement<00:00:47.720> you<00:00:47.839> see<00:00:47.869> is<00:00:48.199> camera<00:00:48.830> movement<00:00:49.339> I

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
movement you see is camera movement I

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.609 
movement you see is camera movement I
matched<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:50.420> perfectly<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.049> the<00:00:51.140> clouds<00:00:51.379> in

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:51.619 
matched it perfectly to the clouds in

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.799 
matched it perfectly to the clouds in
the<00:00:51.650> background<00:00:52.239> this<00:00:53.239> thing<00:00:53.449> pretty<00:00:53.690> much

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
the background this thing pretty much

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.140 
the background this thing pretty much
doesn't<00:00:54.559> move<00:00:54.799> but<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.369> does<00:00:55.610> tilt<00:00:55.939> a<00:00:56.119> little

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
doesn't move but it does tilt a little

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.820 
doesn't move but it does tilt a little
which<00:00:56.540> you'll<00:00:56.720> be<00:00:56.839> able<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.080> see<00:00:57.260> right<00:00:57.500> here

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
which you'll be able to see right here

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.189 
which you'll be able to see right here
I've<00:00:58.040> centered<00:00:58.580> it<00:00:58.760> I'll<00:00:59.150> do<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.629> again<00:00:59.930> in<00:01:00.110> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
I've centered it I'll do that again in a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.789 
I've centered it I'll do that again in a
second<00:01:00.619> here<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.720> there<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.019> is<00:01:03.140> centered<00:01:03.619> to

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
second here so there it is centered to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.840 
second here so there it is centered to
frame<00:01:04.390> there's<00:01:05.390> no<00:01:05.689> string<00:01:06.340> it's<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.520> strange

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
frame there's no string it's a strange

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.330 
frame there's no string it's a strange
thing<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.479> filmed<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.350> ton<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.560> balloons<00:01:09.979> this

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
thing I filmed a ton of balloons this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.070 
thing I filmed a ton of balloons this
thing<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.670> quite<00:01:10.939> a<00:01:10.970> ways<00:01:11.210> away<00:01:11.390> as<00:01:11.810> usual

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
thing is quite a ways away as usual

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.140 
thing is quite a ways away as usual
there's<00:01:12.500> chemtrails<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:13.340> complains<00:01:13.850> that's

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
there's chemtrails and complains that's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
what I was filming so I figured I'd post

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.390 
what I was filming so I figured I'd post
this<00:01:17.960> maybe<00:01:18.290> someday<00:01:18.590> someone<00:01:18.740> else<00:01:19.220> I'll

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
this maybe someday someone else I'll

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.390 
this maybe someday someone else I'll
post<00:01:19.610> something<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:19.970> looks<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.540> I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
post something that looks like this I

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.350 
post something that looks like this I
figure<00:01:22.400> probably<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.820> lot<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.060> people<00:01:23.300> are

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
figure probably a lot of people are

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.150 
figure probably a lot of people are
gonna<00:01:23.450> say<00:01:23.600> oh<00:01:23.630> that's<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.230> balloon<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:24.860> I

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
gonna say oh that's just a balloon but I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.370 
gonna say oh that's just a balloon but I

like a balloon to me for a number of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.040 
like a balloon to me for a number of
reasons<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:30.740> anyhow<00:01:31.690> I'll<00:01:32.690> give<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.010 
couple more views of this object a lot
of<00:01:34.820> people<00:01:35.090> wanted<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.360> see<00:01:35.510> it<00:01:35.630> here's<00:01:35.900> an

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
extreme zoom and each little frame has

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.160 
extreme zoom and each little frame has
been<00:01:39.380> centered<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.870> notice<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.020> white

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
been centered and notice the white

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.390 
been centered and notice the white
there's<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> little<00:01:42.710> white<00:01:42.890> thing<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.220> the

there's like a little white thing on the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.490 
there's like a little white thing on the
on<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.790> right<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.570> goes<00:01:44.720> up<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.050> down<00:01:45.290> at

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
on the right that goes up and down at

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.810 
on the right that goes up and down at
first<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.830> thought<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.010> was<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.220> reflection<00:01:46.729> on

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
first I thought it was a reflection on

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.820 
first I thought it was a reflection on
the<00:01:46.940> objects<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:47.570> now<00:01:47.720> I'm<00:01:47.840> not<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.229> sure<00:01:48.260> and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
the objects but now I'm not so sure and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.680 
the objects but now I'm not so sure and
they<00:01:49.550> are<00:01:49.760> jet<00:01:50.180> black<00:01:51.820> I'll<00:01:52.820> let<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.180> run<00:01:53.479> out

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
they are jet black I'll let this run out

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.340 
they are jet black I'll let this run out
and<00:01:54.049> like<00:01:54.979> I<00:01:55.070> said<00:01:55.180> we<00:01:56.180> have<00:01:56.390> shot<00:01:56.659> endless

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
and like I said we have shot endless

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.260 
and like I said we have shot endless
things<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.340> sky<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.909> are<00:01:58.970> not

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
things in the sky that are not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.149 
things in the sky that are not
interesting<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.200> I'll<00:02:00.290> show<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.830> one<00:02:01.130> here

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
interesting and I'll show you one here

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.440 
interesting and I'll show you one here
in<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.610> second<00:02:02.350> he<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.640> will<00:02:05.150> be<00:02:05.270> out<00:02:05.420> here

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
in a second he you know will be out here

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.180 
in a second he you know will be out here
I<00:02:05.659> would<00:02:05.840> say<00:02:05.990> almost<00:02:06.140> every<00:02:06.590> week<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:07.040> see

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
I would say almost every week we see

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.770 
I would say almost every week we see
something<00:02:07.490> like<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:07.970> in<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.269> sky<00:02:08.450> sometimes

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
something like this in the sky sometimes

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.869 
something like this in the sky sometimes
more<00:02:09.229> than<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:10.129> one's<00:02:10.369> just<00:02:10.610> kind<00:02:10.819> of

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
more than that this one's just kind of

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.670 
more than that this one's just kind of
strange<00:02:11.180> because<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.720> cube<00:02:12.049> shape<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.560> it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
strange because it's cube shape but it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.820 
strange because it's cube shape but it's
clearly<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.129> party<00:02:13.519> balloon<00:02:14.379> almost<00:02:15.379> every

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
clearly a party balloon almost every

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.559 
clearly a party balloon almost every
time<00:02:16.069> we<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.459> something<00:02:16.489> like<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.420> it's

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
time we see something like this if it's

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.390 
time we see something like this if it's
not<00:02:17.840> clear<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.349> me<00:02:18.709> looking<00:02:19.069> through<00:02:19.279> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
not clear to me looking through the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.369 
not clear to me looking through the
telephoto<00:02:19.879> when<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.269> invert<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.840> color<00:02:21.049> you

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
telephoto when I invert the color you

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.589 
telephoto when I invert the color you
can<00:02:21.590> almost<00:02:22.099> always<00:02:22.639> tell<00:02:22.879> what<00:02:23.420> you're

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
can almost always tell what you're

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.440 
can almost always tell what you're
looking<00:02:23.900> at

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
looking at

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.990 
looking at
so<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.080> little<00:02:25.380> barbell<00:02:26.190> looking<00:02:26.550> thing<00:02:26.760> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
so this little barbell looking thing is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
so this little barbell looking thing is
interesting<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.170> main<00:02:28.380> reason<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.770> think

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
interesting and the main reason I think

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.990 
interesting and the main reason I think
it's<00:02:29.099> interesting<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.730> doesn't

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's interesting because it doesn't

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.370 
it's interesting because it doesn't
match<00:02:30.120> anything<00:02:30.390> I've<00:02:30.660> shot<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.260> not

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
match anything I've shot I know it's not

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380 
match anything I've shot I know it's not
a<00:02:31.440> bug<00:02:31.680> or<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.890> bird<00:02:32.099> it's<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.489> too<00:02:32.640> far<00:02:32.910> away<00:02:33.000> I

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
a bug or a bird it's just too far away I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
a bug or a bird it's just too far away I
telephoto<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:34.560> not<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:34.980> had<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.340> in

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
telephoto would not have had this in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.000 
telephoto would not have had this in
focus<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.200> other<00:02:37.230> reason<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.800> cuz

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
focus and the other reason is cuz

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.400 
focus and the other reason is cuz
whenever<00:02:38.280> chem<00:02:38.700> planes<00:02:39.090> around<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
whenever chem planes around you you just

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.660 
whenever chem planes around you you just
don't<00:02:40.590> know<00:02:40.650> what's<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.250> mean<00:02:41.430> I've

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
don't know what's going on I mean I've

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
don't know what's going on I mean I've
seen<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.030> many<00:02:42.180> strange<00:02:42.569> things<00:02:42.660> around<00:02:43.140> chem

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
seen so many strange things around chem

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.710 
seen so many strange things around chem
planes<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.850> anyhow<00:02:45.090> we'll<00:02:45.270> take<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.690> more

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
planes so anyhow we'll take one more

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.330 
planes so anyhow we'll take one more
view<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.380> object<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.100> many<00:02:47.220> people

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
view of this object as so many people

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220 
view of this object as so many people
wanted<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.270> here<00:02:48.660> comes<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
wanted to see it here comes it the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.759 
wanted to see it here comes it the
lower-right<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:51.060> slowed<00:02:51.510> slightly<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.440> not

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
lower-right that slowed slightly and not

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.440 
lower-right that slowed slightly and not
tracked<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> center<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:53.849> can<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.269> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
tracked to center but you can see that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.470 
tracked to center but you can see that
all<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.720> movement<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.200> camera<00:02:55.620> movement

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
all the movement is camera movement

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.009 
all the movement is camera movement
