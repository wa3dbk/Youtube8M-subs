 industrial fat engineering went like this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 the pace then the ostrich could fully live 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.520
 what are the unique properties of this

 composed of saturated and acid acids 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 unsaturated so here are especially valuable in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.640
 In the body, these are unsaturated acids. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 who are able to join the office on 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.560
 reduction reactions give their 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.869
 electrons protect the cells and somehow 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
 to take part in biologically 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.409
 active processes so here is ostrich fat 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.869
 emu contains a large amount

 unsaturated fatty acids 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.700
 which are particularly valuable organism he 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 contains very little phospholipids and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 thanks to this, he actively penetrates 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.619
 our skin also contains spa milk 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 lipids and everything that contains phosphorus and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.880
 phospholipids are delayed by 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.000
 penetration and emu 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.340
 penetrates unhindered and it hits 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.009
 all places where men can do it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 be large and small joints it can
