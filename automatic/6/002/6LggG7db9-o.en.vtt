00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.680
 every evening he picks up the clay for himself 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.310
 itself normally empirically 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.100
 there is such a thing often women do not 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.240
 love to share cooking recipe 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.860
 clay I would not say that this is some kind 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.550
 what kind of greed there can be or else 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.080
 that is why it is so because the person 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.470
 just picks up for themselves 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.960
 composition of clay someone likes to work with 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.290
 more density more greasy clay then 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.239
 there are enough strength methods you need 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.970
 apply when working with not someone likes 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.210
 more work more with light clay 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.980
 more lean here that is every 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.340
 she picks me up 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.110
 where a year and a half is probably the fact that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.760
 find different clay samples and come to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.089
 to some composition today 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.440
 some cooking recipes though i 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.570
 continue to experiment ideally 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.460
 for pottery very well 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 mix well somewhere three grades of clay I 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.360
 I usually started mixing this here 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 greasy clay 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.470
 here it is here and here it is and there is fast 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.510
 In principle these three samples here you are 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.990
 gives a good composition that is possible 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.170
 raise a good product in a circle or 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.060
 sing for white clay i use not to 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.189
 Unfortunately I found only two samples 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 full of sun completely lean fat 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.500
 mix well, too good option 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.479
 it turns out quite tolerable 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.990
 acceptable ideally shot he was showing 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.450
 how to define fat clay there or 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.799
 late that is here ideally for that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.860
 for work on the potterâ€™s wheel usually 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:13.190
 use a little more dense clay 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.680
 again depends on the master that's when 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
 mold a little more fat happens the other way around 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.019
 but here each gopher agronomist as 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.430
 says you should make clay 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.829
 Here I have it already cooked 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.519
 redhead and for that is ideally you should 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.500
 get a composition that is on a break 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.370
 sausages will look like this 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.519
 in such a way that is, he seems to be 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.790
 it breaks but just a little bit that is 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.489
 not greasy or lean clay and not clean 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.380
 intermediate some kind of this here 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 quite flexible 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.440
 good plastic material i.e. 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.030
 a little bit 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.680
 may not be seen as if on video 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.980
 a little bit such evil shouldn't 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.980
 appear 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.590
 here they are evil Mickey slightly visible 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.659
 itself white clay light it would not 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:50.720
 all white on salads to important this more 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:53.239
 soft it me here a little bit some 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.849
 see quite a bit of cracks 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.470
 this very such one appears 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.409
 acceptable composition with which you can 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.000
 work i use both for sculpting and 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.000
 for pottery 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.620
 I hope you need it use 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.620
 good health to all of you
