anyways make them all hyperlink to the
loser<00:03:41.489> slide<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.880> then<00:03:44.880> find<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:46.020> second

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
loser slide and then find one second

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.729 
loser slide and then find one second
just<00:03:46.650> make<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.070> more<00:03:47.310> round<00:03:48.739> then
