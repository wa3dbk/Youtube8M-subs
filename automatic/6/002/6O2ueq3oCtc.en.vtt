while gave up modding for a bit because
I<00:00:06.000> was<00:00:06.120> getting<00:00:06.359> pretty<00:00:06.990> burned<00:00:07.379> out<00:00:07.529> from<00:00:07.770> it

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
I was getting pretty burned out from it

so this time I'm back now I'm trying to
make<00:00:11.250> some<00:00:11.490> fun<00:00:12.090> mods<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:14.210> stop<00:00:15.210> myself<00:00:15.420> from

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
make some fun mods just stop myself from

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.620 
make some fun mods just stop myself from
burning<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.650> again<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.880> here's<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.180> one

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
burning out again so here's my first one

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.529 
burning out again so here's my first one
it's<00:00:19.260> basically<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.830> combined<00:00:22.310> abbud<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.539> your

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
it's basically a combined abbud I your

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.320 
it's basically a combined abbud I your
bench<00:00:24.750> with<00:00:25.140> four<00:00:25.470> pieces<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> paper<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
bench with four pieces of paper and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.730 
bench with four pieces of paper and
makes<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> parchment<00:00:27.859> which<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.460> here

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
makes a parchment which I have one here

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.870 
makes a parchment which I have one here
so<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.160> parchment<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> put

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
so you can take this parchment and put

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
so you can take this parchment and put
it<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.090> wall<00:00:33.440> looks<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> map<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it on the wall looks like a map there

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
it on the wall looks like a map there
are<00:00:35.790> still<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.090> things<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.510> done<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.290> want

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
are still some things to be done I want

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.080 
are still some things to be done I want
to<00:00:37.770> make<00:00:37.920> multiple<00:00:38.190> parchments<00:00:38.790> combined

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to make multiple parchments combined

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.650 
to make multiple parchments combined
there's<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> lightning<00:00:40.890> bug<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
there's a lightning bug with it and it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.610 
there's a lightning bug with it and it
kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.870> extends<00:00:43.379> past<00:00:43.670> where<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.700> should<00:00:45.030> but

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
kind of extends past where it should but

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
kind of extends past where it should but
it's<00:00:46.620> mostly<00:00:46.920> working<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.780> your

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it's mostly working so you have your

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.740 
it's mostly working so you have your
Maps<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:50.820> full<00:00:51.030> maps<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> them

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
Maps now these two full maps one of them

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.680 
Maps now these two full maps one of them
from<00:00:52.020> where<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> started<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.800> i'm<00:00:52.949> just-just

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
from where I started well i'm just-just

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
from where I started well i'm just-just
the<00:00:54.690> left<00:00:54.870> side<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> display

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the left side so if you want to display

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
the left side so if you want to display
them<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.170> might<00:00:58.289> want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> display<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.370> one

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
them you might want to display it as one

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.849 
them you might want to display it as one
map<00:00:59.760> basically<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.649> map

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
map basically so you can take your map

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
map basically so you can take your map
you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> zoom<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.480> scroll<00:01:03.840> around

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you can zoom in you can scroll around

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
you can zoom in you can scroll around
and<00:01:04.589> it'll<00:01:04.979> display<00:01:05.159> basically<00:01:05.909> whatever

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and it'll display basically whatever

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
and it'll display basically whatever
you've<00:01:06.330> selected<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.770> 9<00:01:10.950> maps

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you've selected we also put up to 9 maps

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
you've selected we also put up to 9 maps
across<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.049> combine<00:01:13.290> them<00:01:13.470> all

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
across and it will combine them all

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
across and it will combine them all
based<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> relative<00:01:14.250> position<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> here's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
based on the relative position so here's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.070 
based on the relative position so here's
the<00:01:17.430> mac<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> am<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the mac for I am now I'm right there and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.820 
the mac for I am now I'm right there and
this<00:01:19.470> map<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> left<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.650> can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this map is to the left of it so you can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.700 
this map is to the left of it so you can
show<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.030> doesn't<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> best<00:01:24.710> because

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
show that doesn't look the best because

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
show that doesn't look the best because
you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.330> where<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.390> connects

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can kind of see where it connects

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.480 
you can kind of see where it connects
things<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:29.130> why<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> can

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
things like that but that's why you can

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
things like that but that's why you can
zoom<00:01:29.640> basically<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> show<00:01:30.560> whichever<00:01:31.560> parts

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
zoom basically and show whichever parts

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.060 
zoom basically and show whichever parts
you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> idea<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.829> next

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you want like so so the idea is the next

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
you want like so so the idea is the next
step<00:01:38.250> being<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.119> put<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.600> whole<00:01:39.990> bunch<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
step being you can put a whole bunch of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
step being you can put a whole bunch of
maps<00:01:41.000> on<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> wall<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> wall<00:01:42.930> connect<00:01:44.000> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
maps on a wall and the wall connect and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
maps on a wall and the wall connect and
I'd<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> overlay<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.740> black

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I'd like to overlay kind of just black

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.940 
I'd like to overlay kind of just black
squares<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:48.200> will<00:01:49.200> show<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.560> basically

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
squares in here will show up basically

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
squares in here will show up basically
when<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.220> when<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.939> finish<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
when you when you finish so that you can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.719 
when you when you finish so that you can
make<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> nice<00:01:53.060> wall<00:01:54.060> mural<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.799> your<00:01:55.799> maps<00:01:55.979> but

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
make a nice wall mural of your maps but

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.889 
make a nice wall mural of your maps but
for<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.180> allows<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.719> combine

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
for now it just allows you to combine

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
for now it just allows you to combine
all<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> maps<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.950> far<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
all the maps you have so far so you can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
all the maps you have so far so you can
show<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> bigger<00:02:01.380> picture<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:02.250> your

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
show kind of a bigger picture on your
