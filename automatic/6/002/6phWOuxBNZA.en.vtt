hello and welcome this is carlos bring
you<00:00:18.000> another<00:00:18.360> awesome<00:00:19.230> machine<00:00:19.860> video<00:00:20.160> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you another awesome machine video it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.240 
you another awesome machine video it's
not<00:00:20.689> it's<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.840> brand<00:00:22.140> new<00:00:22.290> one<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.099> an

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
not it's not a brand new one it's an

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790 
not it's not a brand new one it's an
improvement<00:00:23.759> of<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.270> that<00:00:24.480> i<00:00:24.540> had<00:00:25.290> last<00:00:25.649> time

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
improvement of one that i had last time

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.159 
improvement of one that i had last time
and<00:00:26.220> i'll<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.360> run<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.750> through<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
and i'll just run you through the

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.990 
and i'll just run you through the
improvements<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.890> I've<00:00:29.009> made<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.790> i<00:00:29.820> made

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
improvements that I've made so i made

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.620 
improvements that I've made so i made
this<00:00:30.149> column<00:00:30.540> entirely<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.410> sand<00:00:31.940> I've<00:00:32.940> are

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
this column entirely of sand I've are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.520 
this column entirely of sand I've are
moored<00:00:34.339> this<00:00:35.339> tunnel<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.629> it<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.350> withstand

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
moored this tunnel so it can withstand

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.419 
moored this tunnel so it can withstand
tax<00:00:38.280> better<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.829> then<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.010> made<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> entire

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
tax better and then I made the entire

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.250 
tax better and then I made the entire
staircase<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> T<00:00:42.300> door<00:00:42.480> wood<00:00:42.749> and<00:00:42.989> they're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
staircase out of T door wood and they're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.579 
staircase out of T door wood and they're
all<00:00:43.379> linked<00:00:43.769> together<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.370> also<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:46.109> roof<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
all linked together and also the roof is

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.739 
all linked together and also the roof is
of<00:00:46.800> T<00:00:47.010> door<00:00:47.219> wood<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.999> don't<00:00:48.179> have<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> wait

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
of T door wood so you don't have to wait

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.139 
of T door wood so you don't have to wait
for<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.109> to<00:00:49.140> burn<00:00:49.699> because<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.909> maybe

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
for it to burn because you know maybe

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.880 
for it to burn because you know maybe
somebody<00:00:51.719> spills<00:00:52.019> their<00:00:52.170> coffee<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.769> then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
somebody spills their coffee and then

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
somebody spills their coffee and then
the<00:00:52.980> fire<00:00:53.159> can't<00:00:53.489> spread<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> can't

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the fire can't spread now that can't

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
the fire can't spread now that can't
happen<00:00:54.929> in<00:00:55.140> Minecraft<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.679> it<00:00:56.039> could<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.489> real

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
happen in Minecraft but it could in real

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.360 
happen in Minecraft but it could in real
life<00:00:57.469> then<00:00:58.469> when<00:00:58.589> I<00:00:58.620> added<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.819> is<00:01:00.179> a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
life then when I added in here is a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
life then when I added in here is a
glass<00:01:02.370> bar<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.600> sorts<00:01:03.989> which<00:01:04.140> goes<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
glass bar of sorts which goes all the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
glass bar of sorts which goes all the
way<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> bottom<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.850> beneath

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
way down to the bottom and then beneath

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
way down to the bottom and then beneath
it<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.690> door<00:01:07.170> green<00:01:07.470> door<00:01:08.220> green<00:01:08.520> first<00:01:08.910> goes

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it the door green door green first goes

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
it the door green door green first goes
up<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> activate<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> roof<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
up to activate the roof and then it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.510 
up to activate the roof and then it
travels<00:01:11.190> down<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.720> staircase<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
travels down here to the staircase and I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
travels down here to the staircase and I
also<00:01:14.670> add<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.120> this<00:01:15.300> central<00:01:15.810> water<00:01:16.110> column

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
also add it in this central water column

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.310 
also add it in this central water column
for<00:01:16.650> faster<00:01:17.100> transport<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.570> activate<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
for faster transport so you activate it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
for faster transport so you activate it
by<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> bottom<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> hitting

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
by going down to the bottom and hitting

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.610 
by going down to the bottom and hitting
that<00:01:21.900> button<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
that button and you basically have the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.540 
that button and you basically have the
amount<00:01:25.620> of<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> takes<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
amount of time that it takes for the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.790 
amount of time that it takes for the
door<00:01:26.700> green<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> top<00:01:27.440> for<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
door green you get to the top for you to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800 
door green you get to the top for you to
get<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> fastest<00:01:30.330> way<00:01:30.390> would

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
get to the top so the fastest way would

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
get to the top so the fastest way would
most<00:01:31.080> likely<00:01:31.260> be<00:01:31.620> water<00:01:32.280> column<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.730> take

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
most likely be water column you can take

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480 
most likely be water column you can take
the<00:01:33.090> stairs<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.890> might<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.340> too

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the stairs but that might not be too

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.200 
the stairs but that might not be too
good<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.790> idea<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:38.070> control<00:01:38.550> room<00:01:38.820> there

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
good of an idea the control room there

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.360 
good of an idea the control room there
are<00:01:39.770> several<00:01:40.770> methods<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.930> neutralizing<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
are several methods of neutralizing the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.240 
are several methods of neutralizing the
zombies<00:01:44.370> or<00:01:44.580> other<00:01:45.470> inhabitants<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.160> the

zombies or other inhabitants so the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.310 
zombies or other inhabitants so the
first<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.180> explosives<00:01:48.900> beneath

walk<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:21.989> fall<00:02:22.319> into<00:02:22.650> magma<00:02:23.690> which

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
walk out they will fall into magma which

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
walk out they will fall into magma which
will<00:02:24.930> kill<00:02:25.349> them<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> let's<00:02:28.349> begin<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
will kill them so let's begin and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.990 
will kill them so let's begin and
detonate<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.630> guess<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.670> think<00:02:32.670> everything

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
detonate it I guess I think everything

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080 
detonate it I guess I think everything
is<00:02:33.090> good<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:33.530> all<00:02:34.530> right<00:02:34.769> now<00:02:35.640> let's<00:02:35.880> go

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is good to go all right now let's go

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.949 
is good to go all right now let's go
down<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.300> watch<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> chaos<00:02:37.260> unfold<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
down and watch the chaos unfold so you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.350 
down and watch the chaos unfold so you
can<00:02:40.049> see<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.380> cells<00:02:40.709> exploding<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.459> they

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
can see all the cells exploding and they

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.260 
can see all the cells exploding and they
floor<00:02:42.690> toggled<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:44.040> reveal<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.549> manual

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.880 

and<00:02:51.540> there<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:53.640> zombie<00:02:54.150> here

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and there you have it little zombie here

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.660 
and there you have it little zombie here
doesn't<00:02:55.890> look<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.100> he's<00:02:56.250> having<00:02:56.400> two<00:02:56.640> there

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
doesn't look like he's having two there

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.030 
doesn't look like he's having two there
at<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> time<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.960> can<00:03:00.990> see<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.500> cells<00:03:01.830> are

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
at the time so you can see the cells are

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
at the time so you can see the cells are
completely<00:03:02.490> destroyed<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.180> neither<00:03:03.360> do

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

fell down and got caught in the magma or

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.790 
fell down and got caught in the magma or
they<00:03:08.670> would<00:03:08.820> caught<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.210> explosion<00:03:09.800> now

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
they would caught in the explosion now

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.470 
they would caught in the explosion now
that<00:03:11.070> this<00:03:11.520> place<00:03:11.760> has<00:03:11.910> been<00:03:12.030> flooded<00:03:12.240> you

from going and disassemble the zombies
in<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.070> facility<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.670> safe

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
in there then then the facility is safe

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.380 
in there then then the facility is safe
to<00:03:18.360> restore<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.700> event<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.970> all<00:03:21.240> of

to restore but in the event that all of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.340 
to restore but in the event that all of
these<00:03:21.480> systems<00:03:21.960> somehow<00:03:22.380> miraculously<00:03:22.650> fail

these systems somehow miraculously fail

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.140 
these systems somehow miraculously fail
there's<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.680> last<00:03:25.890> thing<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.060> should

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
there's one last thing that you should

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.540 
there's one last thing that you should
we're<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> do<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:29.130> can<00:03:29.250> see<00:03:29.430> it's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
we're going to do and you can see it's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.970 
we're going to do and you can see it's
spreading<00:03:30.050> just<00:03:31.050> quickly<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.530> up<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.950> top

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
spreading just quickly go up to the top

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
spreading just quickly go up to the top
and<00:03:32.930> there<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.020> is<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:35.430> see<00:03:35.670> all<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.420> sand

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and there it is and you see all the sand

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.630 
and there it is and you see all the sand
fall<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.200> I'll<00:03:37.320> continue<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.860> fall<00:03:38.070> while<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
fall and I'll continue to fall while the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.260 
fall and I'll continue to fall while the
staircase<00:03:39.060> beneath<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:41.090> collapsing

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.580 

so<00:03:49.900> if<00:03:49.960> we're<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.490> dig<00:03:51.490> down<00:03:51.700> here<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.590> there

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so if we're to dig down here and there

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.290 
so if we're to dig down here and there
you<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:54.100> worked<00:03:54.700> pretty<00:03:54.940> well

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
you have it it's worked pretty well

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.770 
you have it it's worked pretty well
seems<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:57.280> didn't<00:03:57.670> seal<00:03:58.150> off<00:03:58.330> this<00:03:58.510> one

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
seems like just didn't seal off this one
