00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.300
 remember these women go to 35 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.560
 thousandths of an inch 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:18.330
 or what is the same of 35 go â€‹â€‹to a 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.840
 they go to point 9 millimeters and they realize 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.730
 we have our new 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 let's calibrate those that remember to 35 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.640
 are normal by resistance this is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.640
 good to 35 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.289
 from being equal well to 35 always 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.269
 you stay as I heard metal and as I already 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.180
 comes calibrated from agency equal to where 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.510
 reflexology and if it fell on the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.579
 packaging in the packaging something happened 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.699
 or not something in quality control in the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.470
 factories that pass or still a woman 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.640
 It can be for different cars 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.180
 and what happens to us jingle bells or 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.010
 claims to us 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 that's why I always know that calibration myself 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:20.930
 I insist a lot on that we are going to put 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.930
 now if our spark plugs 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.740
 remember you can put it with the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.180
 I'm already used to this 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.760
 screwdriver that is common 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 spark plug cap that is chevrolet 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.330
 because it is comfortable 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.390
 They are very good so I can not run 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.270
 no rope and it's very fast at the time 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.210
 to remove I do not know what monkey so much if it 's more 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 practical if you are going to dedicate yourself to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.370
 the mechanics do this imagine yourself by 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.550
 less than three pesos a day his professor 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.550
 24 hours a day, 365 days a day 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.350
 great advantage they get stuck with something they come back 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.880
 to see the video if they are not in the network 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.880
 goal in america a little 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.349
 repeat as many times as you want the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.739
 video if you go a course and pay 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.450
 for a single course in the reality of 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.030
 mechanical plus dotcom from here once 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.180
 they finished the course because they no longer 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 teacher appears that and here what 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.639
 can have how many times they want 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.639
 repeat
