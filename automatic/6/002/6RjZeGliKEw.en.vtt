 rigid 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.529
 is a prayer data storage device 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.349
 that uses an unpublished recording system 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.909
 to store digital data consists of 1 a few bishops dishes 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:29.819
 religious 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.620

 he pointed 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.180
 On each plate is placed a head of readings writing floating on a 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.980
 thin blade the air generated by the rotation of the mets 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 the physical components in a disk drive 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.220
 two discs or silvers in English are made of composite video will be 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.600
 my car or aluminum finally polished i 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560

 Argentina is assembled are responsible for reading and 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 writing of the data we have most of the hard drives rihanna seems to give 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.010
 reading scriptures on each side of the cis however some discs high 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.400
 performance and in 2 as responsible on each surface so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.039
 the contribution of the hard disk that acted as support on which it is mounted 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.300
 and the dishes 3 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.890
 marker 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.380
 is an engine that moves the writing that contains the heads of the reading 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 between the center and the closed vortex 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.519

 yes lynch 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:25.719
 the pair of tracks on opposite sides of the disk is called sinister if a disk 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.259
 hard contains multiple discs one cylinder includes all parts of 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:37.979
 tracks directly one on top of it he wore a disk is directed at me 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:43.309
 concentric circles side called the heads moves between the party more 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.150
 expected and the track about this year 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.010
 is the square circular path through the circular surface of the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.930
 plate of a disc with the head of reading as a writer each track is 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.930
 formed by one or more

 sectors 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.480
 batista fired in one or two few sectors given that the outer court are 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:16.879
 larger than the interior exteriors contain the minutes and
