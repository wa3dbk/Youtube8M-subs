00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880

countries in the Middle East say if you
also<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> rather<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.020> had<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
also would you rather that they had a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
also would you rather that they had a
proper<00:01:23.580> rule<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.210> law<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:25.229> fully

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
proper rule of law which fully

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
proper rule of law which fully
recognized<00:01:26.220> human<00:01:26.520> rights<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> understand

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
recognized human rights as we understand

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
recognized human rights as we understand
them<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> democratic<00:01:29.640> system

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
them or the kind of democratic system

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
them or the kind of democratic system
that<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> West<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> choose

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that we have in the West if you choose

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
that we have in the West if you choose
between<00:01:32.790> those<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.780> wonder<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> would

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
between those I wonder which you would

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
between those I wonder which you would
choose<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:36.119> ought<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.659> together

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
choose because they ought to go together

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
choose because they ought to go together
but<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> had<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> choose<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
but I think if I had to choose that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
but I think if I had to choose that
rather<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.780> first<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.650> saw<00:01:40.860> human

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
rather that first of all we saw human

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
rather that first of all we saw human
all<00:01:41.490> human<00:01:41.970> rights<00:01:42.150> properly<00:01:43.610> respected<00:01:45.409> now

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
all human rights properly respected now

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.550 
all human rights properly respected now
human<00:01:46.770> beings<00:01:47.149> need<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.479> protected<00:01:49.409> from

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
human beings need to be protected from

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.630 
human beings need to be protected from
one<00:01:50.189> another

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
one another

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.980 
one another
hence<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.439> rule<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> law<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.990> we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
hence we have the rule of law but we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.310 
hence we have the rule of law but we
also<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> protected<00:01:57.320> against

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
also need to be protected against

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.510 
also need to be protected against
governments<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> great

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
governments and one of the great

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
governments and one of the great
emphases<00:02:00.060> impetuses<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> great<00:02:01.259> human

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
emphases impetuses for the great human

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.219 
emphases impetuses for the great human
rights<00:02:01.770> movement<00:02:02.219> after<00:02:02.340> 1948<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.570> course<00:02:03.840> was

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
rights movement after 1948 of course was

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
rights movement after 1948 of course was
to<00:02:04.380> protect<00:02:04.770> human<00:02:05.219> beings<00:02:05.520> against

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
to protect human beings against

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.660 
to protect human beings against
governments<00:02:06.680> with<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> experience<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> Nazi

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
governments with the experience of Nazi

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.420 
governments with the experience of Nazi
Germany<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.300> Stalin<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.950> Russia<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.340> was

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
Germany and Stalin in in Russia it was

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.410 
Germany and Stalin in in Russia it was
individuals<00:02:12.180> who<00:02:12.300> needed<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
individuals who needed to be

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.750 
individuals who needed to be
protected<00:02:14.050> not<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.040> much<00:02:15.220> against<00:02:15.610> one

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
protected not so much against one

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.729 
protected not so much against one
another<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.569> against<00:02:17.080> tyrannical

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
another but against tyrannical

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.300 
another but against tyrannical
government<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.050> given<00:02:20.470> rise

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
government and I think that's given rise

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.420 
government and I think that's given rise
to<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:23.080> rather<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.410> brilliant<00:02:23.860> phrase<00:02:24.099> by

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
to really rather a brilliant phrase by

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.059 
to really rather a brilliant phrase by
