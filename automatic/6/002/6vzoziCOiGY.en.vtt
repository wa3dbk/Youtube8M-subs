I<00:00:41.700> make<00:00:41.969> called<00:00:42.239> MCPE<00:00:42.690> mod<00:00:42.960> locator<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.620> got

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I make called MCPE mod locator it's got

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
I make called MCPE mod locator it's got
you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:43.980> mods<00:00:44.309> texture<00:00:44.820> skins<00:00:45.090> maps<00:00:45.360> seed

servers<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.100> don't<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.730> basically

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
servers and I don't know just basically

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
servers and I don't know just basically
it's<00:00:48.420> basically<00:00:48.809> simplifies<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> process<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it's basically simplifies the process of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's basically simplifies the process of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
like that and that includes servers I'm

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100

the description after we gotten its go
to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.390> servers<00:01:00.870> zero<00:01:01.649> point<00:01:01.890> eleven<00:01:02.190> point<00:01:02.370> x

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to do servers zero point eleven point x

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
to do servers zero point eleven point x
servers<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.239> X<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> don't<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.110> stands

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
servers the X if you don't know stands

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.000 
servers the X if you don't know stands
for<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:04.949> any<00:01:05.220> version<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:06.390> after<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.619> 11

for like any version that after the 11

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
for like any version that after the 11
basically<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> could<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.880> zero<00:01:09.420> point

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
basically so that could be zero point

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
basically so that could be zero point
levin<00:01:09.780> point<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.170> zero<00:01:10.200> point<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.010> three

then<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.010> port<00:03:06.510> now<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.540> don't<00:03:07.719> even<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:08.079> if

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
then the port now I don't even know if

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.569 
then the port now I don't even know if
this<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.319> going<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.709> accept<00:03:09.189> that<00:03:09.370> i<00:03:09.430> always

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
this is going to accept that i always

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.709 
this is going to accept that i always
put<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.879> an<00:03:10.000> actual<00:03:10.329> port<00:03:11.790> let's<00:03:12.790> see<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.299> an

put in an actual port let's see in an

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.899 
put in an actual port let's see in an
actual<00:03:13.930> an<00:03:14.200> IP<00:03:14.560> address<00:03:14.919> i'll<00:03:15.579> just<00:03:15.760> do<00:03:15.879> a

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
actual an IP address i'll just do a

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.939 
actual an IP address i'll just do a
simple<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:18.030> 1681<00:03:19.319> did<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.379> just<00:03:20.500> hit<00:03:20.709> click

simple one 1681 did you just hit click

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.619 
simple one 1681 did you just hit click
add<00:03:21.129> server<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.879> server<00:03:21.909> has<00:03:22.209> been<00:03:22.359> added<00:03:22.510> to

add server the server has been added to
your<00:03:22.690> game<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.139> reason<00:03:23.409> that<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.620> would

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
your game and the reason that you would

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.719 
your game and the reason that you would
do<00:03:23.949> this<00:03:24.069> because<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.370> know<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.519> can

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
do this because you know you can

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.860 
do this because you know you can
automatically<00:03:25.329> already<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:26.019> do<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:27.870> MC

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
automatically already can do this in MC

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.110 
automatically already can do this in MC
pease<00:03:29.199> you<00:03:29.470> know<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.799> type<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:30.939> it's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
pease you know you just type it in it's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.199 
pease you know you just type it in it's
easy<00:03:31.180> but<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:32.019> also<00:03:32.169> paste<00:03:33.030> which<00:03:34.030> I

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
don't think I have anything in my

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.979 
don't think I have anything in my
clipboard<00:03:35.439> yeah<00:03:36.159> copy<00:03:36.540> then<00:03:37.540> we<00:03:37.659> hold<00:03:37.870> down

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989

you<00:03:38.139> can<00:03:38.290> pay<00:03:38.500> stuff<00:03:38.829> into<00:03:39.099> there<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.459> if<00:03:39.609> you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
you can pay stuff into there so if you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640 
you can pay stuff into there so if you
have<00:03:39.909> like<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> long<00:03:40.780> IP<00:03:41.019> address<00:03:41.379> because<00:03:41.500> it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
have like a long IP address because it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.229 
have like a long IP address because it
seems<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:41.829> every<00:03:42.189> time<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.370> go<00:03:42.729> to<00:03:42.759> add<00:03:42.970> an<00:03:43.120> IP

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
seems like every time I go to add an IP

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.929 
seems like every time I go to add an IP
address<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:44.019> get<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> longest<00:03:45.250> freakin<00:03:45.609> IP

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
address I get the longest freakin IP

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.420 
address I get the longest freakin IP
address<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> internet<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:48.310> know

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
address on the internet and you know

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.009 
address on the internet and you know
that<00:03:48.759> I<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.939> to<00:03:49.030> try<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> remember<00:03:49.479> that<00:03:49.629> and

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
that I have to try to remember that and

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.619 
that I have to try to remember that and
the<00:03:50.379> most<00:03:50.560> confusing<00:03:50.919> one<00:03:51.040> at<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.669> that

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
the most confusing one at that and that

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.300 
the most confusing one at that and that
never<00:03:52.750> works<00:03:52.989> out<00:03:53.169> great<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.919> can

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
never works out great so that you can

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.369 
never works out great so that you can
copy<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.759> IP<00:03:55.030> address<00:03:55.060> paste<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.319> if

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
copy the IP address paste it in and if

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.869 
copy the IP address paste it in and if
you<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.650> do<00:03:56.769> like<00:03:56.889> multiple<00:03:57.430> servers

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
you want to do like multiple servers

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.219 
you want to do like multiple servers
that<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.150> make<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.419> quite<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.659> bit<00:03:58.720> easier<00:03:59.079> as

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
that can make that quite a bit easier as

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.110 
that can make that quite a bit easier as
well<00:03:59.259> so<00:04:00.250> that's<00:04:00.669> why<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:00.879> would<00:04:01.090> use

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
well so that's why you would use

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.879 
well so that's why you would use
something<00:04:01.569> like<00:04:01.599> that<00:04:01.959> because<00:04:02.139> you<00:04:02.620> can't

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
something like that because you can't

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.449 
something like that because you can't
pay<00:04:03.129> stuff<00:04:03.489> into<00:04:03.939> the<00:04:04.709> selection<00:04:05.709> screen<00:04:05.889> here

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
pay stuff into the selection screen here

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.119 
pay stuff into the selection screen here
on<00:04:06.930> MCPE<00:04:07.930> at<00:04:08.199> list<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.530> couldn't<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:08.949> last

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
on MCPE at list you couldn't the last

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.509 
on MCPE at list you couldn't the last
time<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.370> tried<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:11.310> can't<00:04:12.310> do<00:04:12.400> anything

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
time I tried I can't do anything

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.550 
time I tried I can't do anything
actually<00:04:14.489> there<00:04:15.489> we<00:04:15.549> go<00:04:15.669> yeah<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:17.169> can't<00:04:17.380> pay

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
actually there we go yeah you can't pay

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.779 
actually there we go yeah you can't pay
stuff<00:04:17.829> into<00:04:18.070> there<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.430> why<00:04:18.609> that

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
stuff into there so that's why that

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.430 
stuff into there so that's why that
would<00:04:18.909> make<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.269> bit<00:04:19.449> easier<00:04:19.779> you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
would make it a little bit easier you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.529 
would make it a little bit easier you
know<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.700> yeah<00:04:21.880> that's<00:04:22.090> how<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.240> can<00:04:22.419> use

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
know so yeah that's how you can use

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.060 
know so yeah that's how you can use
servers<00:04:23.260> on<00:04:23.409> zero<00:04:23.680> point<00:04:23.830> 11<00:04:24.070> point<00:04:24.279> 0<00:04:24.400> all

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.340 
servers on zero point 11 point 0 all

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
servers that are going to be in this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.770 
servers that are going to be in this
list<00:04:27.620> here<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.400> list<00:04:28.700> this<00:04:29.270> list<00:04:29.570> are

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
list here not this list this list are

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.570 
list here not this list this list are
going<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.230> be<00:04:30.380> on<00:04:30.680> are<00:04:31.160> going<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.490> be

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
going to be on are going to be

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.250 
going to be on are going to be

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.840 
compatible with zero point 11 point 0
whether<00:04:33.980> or<00:04:34.190> not<00:04:34.280> they're<00:04:34.460> going<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.670> actually

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
whether or not they're going to actually

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.690 
whether or not they're going to actually
be<00:04:35.060> full<00:04:35.480> or<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:36.110> know<00:04:36.200> online<00:04:36.530> currently<00:04:37.490> I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
be full or you know online currently I

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.370 
be full or you know online currently I
don't<00:04:38.330> actually<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:38.840> because<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.170> can't

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
don't actually know because I can't

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.860 
don't actually know because I can't
control<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.860> but<00:04:40.460> one<00:04:41.420> thing<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.660> might<00:04:41.750> be

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
control that but one thing you might be

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.270 
control that but one thing you might be
wondering<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.350> why<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.590> server<00:04:42.980> status

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
wondering is why the server status

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.250 
wondering is why the server status
doesn't<00:04:43.730> show<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:43.910> here<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.870> reason<00:04:45.140> is

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
doesn't show up here and the reason is

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.660 
doesn't show up here and the reason is
it<00:04:45.380> because<00:04:45.590> zero<00:04:45.800> point<00:04:45.950> 11<00:04:46.190> point<00:04:46.370> 0<00:04:46.460> does

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
it because zero point 11 point 0 does

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.390 
it because zero point 11 point 0 does
that<00:04:46.880> for<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.180> already<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.830> if<00:04:49.070> i

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
that for you already so you know if i

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.610 
that for you already so you know if i
put<00:04:49.640> it<00:04:49.760> if<00:04:50.000> i<00:04:50.090> put<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.450> server<00:04:51.140> in<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.380> list

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
put it if i put the server in the list

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.070 
put it if i put the server in the list
here<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:51.950> was<00:04:52.100> up<00:04:52.280> at<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.700> time<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:54.050> can

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
here it was up at one time so you can

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960 
here it was up at one time so you can
just<00:04:54.260> add<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.890> then<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.370> can<00:04:55.490> watch<00:04:55.700> it

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
just add it and then you can watch it

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.640 
just add it and then you can watch it
through<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.480> mCP<00:04:56.900> yep<00:04:57.110> because<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.500> does<00:04:57.620> a

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
through the mCP yep because it does a

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.170 
through the mCP yep because it does a
little<00:04:57.800> bit<00:04:57.950> better<00:04:58.040> job<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.400> checking<00:04:58.790> if<00:04:59.150> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
little bit better job of checking if the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.510 
little bit better job of checking if the
servers<00:04:59.600> online<00:04:59.780> or<00:05:00.080> not<00:05:00.230> then<00:05:00.530> what<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.250> had

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
servers online or not then what I had

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.520 
servers online or not then what I had
previously<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.720> zero<00:05:02.930> point<00:05:03.020> 10<00:05:03.230> point<00:05:03.410> X

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
previously on the zero point 10 point X

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.770 
previously on the zero point 10 point X
page<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.100> that's<00:05:04.790> why<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.030> don't<00:05:05.300> have<00:05:05.450> that<00:05:05.480> in

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
page so that's why I don't have that in

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.380 
page so that's why I don't have that in
there<00:05:05.900> this<00:05:06.110> time<00:05:06.140> around<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.400> still<00:05:08.060> all<00:05:08.300> the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
there this time around but still all the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.970 
there this time around but still all the
servers<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.690> are<00:05:08.780> going<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:09.050> in<00:05:09.200> here<00:05:09.830> are

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
servers that are going to be in here are

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.160 
servers that are going to be in here are
going<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.220> work<00:05:10.670> with<00:05:11.030> zero<00:05:11.360> point<00:05:11.510> 11<00:05:11.780> point<00:05:11.990> O

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
going to work with zero point 11 point O

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.170 
going to work with zero point 11 point O
so<00:05:12.770> let's<00:05:13.100> just<00:05:13.400> make<00:05:13.520> sure<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.700> watch<00:05:13.940> out<00:05:14.150> for

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180
