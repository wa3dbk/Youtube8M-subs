this came out I'm getting the individual
while<00:01:18.920> seasons<00:01:19.920> instead<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> getting<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
while seasons instead of getting the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
while seasons instead of getting the
matrix<00:01:21.900> collection<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> whole<00:01:23.729> series

matrix collection of the whole series

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.670

just<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.530> bit

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just because I think that's a little bit

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
just because I think that's a little bit
expensive<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.430> me<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:28.020> just

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
expensive for me right now and I just

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
expensive for me right now and I just
like<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.829> having<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.570> individual

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like the look of having the individual

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.880 
like the look of having the individual

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.699 
so after watching all the first disc
which<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.480> about<00:03:46.840> half<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.110> first<00:03:47.409> season<00:03:49.709> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
broadcast version so it is a little bit

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.059 
broadcast version so it is a little bit
grainy<00:03:56.950> so<00:03:57.580> it's<00:03:57.790> not<00:03:58.530> digitally<00:03:59.530> remastered

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
grainy so it's not digitally remastered
