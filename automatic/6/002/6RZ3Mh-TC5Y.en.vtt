 between the consultant 13 people and the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.260

 sister consultant through 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.239
 an analysis of the profiles present in the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.110

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.850
 the figures in candidates most in line with 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.670

 in the non-offices where the consultant goes 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.950

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.470

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.489
 a series of interviews the candidates in 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.570

 then waiting for the company's feedback 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.080
 customer 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.729

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.280
 in answers to various announcements once 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.740
 that the company has defined those that 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.500
 they must be the candidates to meet 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.050
 we follow the whole process of the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.660

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.090
 in the company by the candidates up 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.610
 the inter selection in most 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.200
 of the cases we also try to do it with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.869
 candidates who stop 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.850
 at the beginning of the process those candidates who 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.000
 announcements respond where that is 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.920
 possible also seen the huge amount of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.460
