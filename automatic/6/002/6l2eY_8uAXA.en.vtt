pissed when I first announced X&amp;Y

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.540

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
that when I have mega evolutions this
generation<00:01:53.600> what's<00:01:54.600> nice<00:01:54.780> about<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.230> new

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
generation what's nice about the new

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
generation what's nice about the new
modern<00:01:55.890> technology<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.300> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
modern technology that we have is that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
modern technology that we have is that
the<00:01:57.570> new<00:01:57.690> Megas<00:01:58.050> wouldn't<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.560> trapped<00:01:58.950> on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the new Megas wouldn't be trapped on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.400 
the new Megas wouldn't be trapped on
those<00:01:59.340> games<00:01:59.960> instead<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.110> could<00:02:01.260> just

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
those games instead they could just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.980 
those games instead they could just
release<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> software<00:02:02.790> update<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.060> x<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.510> y<00:02:03.660> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
release a software update for x and y so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
release a software update for x and y so
we<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.530> new<00:02:04.620> mega<00:02:04.860> evolutions<00:02:05.370> on

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
we can have the new mega evolutions on

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.090 
we can have the new mega evolutions on
those<00:02:05.700> games<00:02:05.940> too<00:02:06.500> second<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.860> we'll<00:02:07.979> get

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
those games too second I think we'll get

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.490 
those games too second I think we'll get
just<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.429> Megas<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.210> general<00:02:09.660> six

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
just more Megas in general six

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
just more Megas in general six
generation<00:02:10.979> had<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.160> fewest<00:02:11.520> new<00:02:11.730> pokemon

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
generation had the fewest new pokemon

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.570 
generation had the fewest new pokemon
introduced<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> date<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.140> only<00:02:13.290> 70<00:02:13.800> if<00:02:14.400> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
introduced to date with only 70 if you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.610 
introduced to date with only 70 if you
add<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.940> Megas<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:16.050> still<00:02:16.440> less<00:02:16.590> than

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
add in the Megas that's still less than

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.060 
add in the Megas that's still less than
the<00:02:16.800> 100<00:02:17.280> pokemon<00:02:17.580> introduced<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.150> Gen<00:02:18.390> 2<00:02:19.070> so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the 100 pokemon introduced in Gen 2 so

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.010 
the 100 pokemon introduced in Gen 2 so
I've<00:02:20.430> kind<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.090> thinkin<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.600> maybe<00:02:21.750> did

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
I've kind of thinkin to know maybe did

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.850 
I've kind of thinkin to know maybe did
that<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.260> purpose

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that on purpose

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
that on purpose
planning<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.459> release<00:02:23.580> more<00:02:24.000> mega<00:02:24.240> evolutions

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
planning to release more mega evolutions

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.770 
planning to release more mega evolutions
with<00:02:25.110> newer<00:02:25.530> games<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> generation<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
with newer games in the generation so I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
with newer games in the generation so I
think<00:02:28.110> we'll<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.250> many<00:02:29.490> with

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
think we'll get some not as many with

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.270 
think we'll get some not as many with
X&amp;Y<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.390> some<00:02:30.720> new<00:02:31.230> Megas<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.800> these<00:02:31.950> games

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
X&amp;Y but some new Megas with these games

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.060 
X&amp;Y but some new Megas with these games
I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.630> most<00:02:33.840> likely<00:02:34.110> ones<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.770> for

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
I think the most likely ones are for

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.920 
I think the most likely ones are for
sceptile<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.640> Swampert<00:02:36.090> which<00:02:36.630> would<00:02:36.840> be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
sceptile and Swampert which would be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.390 
sceptile and Swampert which would be
awesome

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
awesome

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.150 
awesome
especially<00:02:39.330> since<00:02:39.540> Blaziken<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.950> other

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
especially since Blaziken the other

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.580 
especially since Blaziken the other
Homans<00:02:41.580> starter<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.510> already<00:02:42.810> more

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
Homans starter got one already more

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.920 
Homans starter got one already more
magan's<00:02:44.130> yeah<00:02:44.430> now<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.239> last<00:02:45.450> prediction<00:02:45.720> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
magan's yeah now this last prediction is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.270 
magan's yeah now this last prediction is
a<00:02:45.959> fair<00:02:46.200> amount<00:02:46.260> bolder<00:02:46.709> than<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.860> other<00:02:47.070> two

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
a fair amount bolder than the other two

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.590 
a fair amount bolder than the other two
but<00:02:47.580> I'm<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.910> say<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.150> anyway<00:02:48.360> it's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
but I'm going to say it anyway it's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
but I'm going to say it anyway it's
because<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:50.250> they're<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
because I can I think they're going to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.400 
because I can I think they're going to
introduce<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.970> completely<00:02:51.690> new<00:02:51.870> region<00:02:52.260> with

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
introduce a completely new region with

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.530 
introduce a completely new region with
these<00:02:52.560> games<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.910> least<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.360> more

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
these games or at least some more

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.170 
these games or at least some more
extensive<00:02:54.989> postgame<00:02:55.580> rubies<00:02:56.580> sapphire<00:02:56.970> never

extensive postgame rubies sapphire never

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.580 
extensive postgame rubies sapphire never
won't<00:02:57.300> have<00:02:57.480> some<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.019> most<00:02:58.170> limited

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
won't have some of the most limited

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.020 
won't have some of the most limited
postgame<00:02:59.010> we've<00:02:59.220> seen<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.610> any<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.880> main

postgame we've seen in any of the main

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.940 
postgame we've seen in any of the main
series<00:03:00.300> games<00:03:00.690> especially<00:03:01.230> compared<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
series games especially compared to the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.130 
series games especially compared to the
games<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.250> take<00:03:02.400> place<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.790> Johto<00:03:03.239> all<00:03:03.480> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
games that take place in Johto all you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.539 
games that take place in Johto all you
gain<00:03:04.290> access<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.680> after<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> league<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.430> the

gain access to after the league is the

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.210 
gain access to after the league is the
Battle<00:03:05.940> Tower<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.420> frontier<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:08.130> they're

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
Battle Tower or frontier I think they're

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.740 
Battle Tower or frontier I think they're
going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> expand<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> postgame<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.600> these

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
going to expand on the postgame in these

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.440 
going to expand on the postgame in these
games<00:03:10.019> creating<00:03:10.890> some<00:03:11.100> completely<00:03:11.790> new<00:03:11.910> areas

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
