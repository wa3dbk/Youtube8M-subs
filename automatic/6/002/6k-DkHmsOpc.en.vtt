stranger that I had picked up over there

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.840 
stranger that I had picked up over there
one<00:02:01.420> side<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.750> female<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.860> other<00:02:03.070> side<00:02:03.550> is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
one side is female and the other side is

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.780 
one side is female and the other side is
male<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.320> like<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> slide<00:02:05.950> lookbook<00:02:06.670> I
