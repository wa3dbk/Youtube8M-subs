00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello how good are we all going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 learn how to recycle a lot of people 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 I was saying because it's not a tutorial 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.059
 how to recycle what are the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 materials that I'm very important in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.410
 what is the 21st century and well then 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.960
 thought because he explains a little bit about 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.449
 over as the subject of recycling and much 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.890
 people we can say you take it together yo 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 that I know for example that I bring several 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 things I will not teach for example this I 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.340
 I brought in and then I was among others 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 soleil things of these things and good 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.239
 because the main thing of all we have to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 know that we have to recycle a lot 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.630
 people we can recycle and they are bad and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.170
 Well , first of all I'm going to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.790
 teach what it brings me we have to know 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.050
 that for example, I do not have what 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 are what are containers for 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 recycle what these things are and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.870
 then what I do is separate light 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 using different bag bag 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.379
 colors and then what do I have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 what to do when I'm going to get two 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.149
 points is what I do is empty those 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 things in each container that we do not have 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.739
 contents in current house 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.840
 recycling does not mean that by not having 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.689
 a container at home 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 of different colors do not recycle you can 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.380
 do this that I have done and now 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
 I will show how I have done it only 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.340
 he took the bag and I put green 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 with the green ones, what they do is done 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 organic materials such 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.459
 then he has chosen I will put it here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 the yellow is the yellow condemned 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.569
 here is going to take what are bottles 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.659
 they can also be battles of 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.280
 recycling as they are aerosols or also 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.100
 wrappers of it that I know for example 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.859
 of this from the different bottles 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.319
 types and we will not be able to recycle anything 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.450
 if we do not have if we do not have a container 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.360
 that we will do if I caught 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.299
 also yellow as I said and blue 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.819
 that this here that here where does it go? 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.039
 which are for example newspapers 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.920
 cartons also these things go in the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.770
 blue container and then they can a lot 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.649
 people, I have made a kind of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 invention that is from a hanger I have 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.569
 done what there is a container with 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.660
 green nador against two green ones of the 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.620
 bottles can already be glass bottles 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.420
 Larger bottles 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.099
 small of all kinds and then 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 we just have to hook this in 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.000
 any place in a door whatever 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.330
 and here you can take what are the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.330
 bottles 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.710
 an effective thing one thing that says this 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.220
 you can not do that you can do with 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.770
 the proposal to throw it out are the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.780
 bottles are and well, as I have 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.300
 said in the container that we are here 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.060
 where the two balls the matter 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.580
 organic in the organic matter that I 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.890
 I mean I can already be remnants 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 of food remains of products as if 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 outside food banana apple 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 orange whatever for everything here 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.180
 in the green condemned and many people 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.130
 when it does and all and as I said 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.860
 previously because of knowledge that yes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.020
 for example the bulb for example by 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.420
 the board in the green control all the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.850
 garbage in the green container and that's not 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.130
 You can recycle if you put one thing together 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.440
 with another in the end neither one thing nor another 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.110
 they are all together and from then on 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.910
 you can not take anything out it 's impossible that 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.070
 from a boat I do not want to take this out 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.210
 good from here as you are going to know 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.160
 what is to recycle a bottle or a 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.600
 bulb whatever it is impossible not 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.820
 you can say things you have to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.920
 separate and then that's why I invented what 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.260
 what is recycling because from there 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.270
 You can recycle things if you 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.550
 together, they can not recycle it 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.120
 but instead if you put together for example 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.890
 this with 40,000 more for example can 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 two from here they can take out 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.390
 what is a plastic bottle or 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.970
 40,000 inverse of this can draw a 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.400
 but if you heap together all shared 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.250
 and you can not get anything logical and normal 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.780
 if your tip 40,000 pens can then 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.080
 take 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.470
 then plugs for a lot of plugs or 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.810
 40,000 slums to baby I do not know if I 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.120
 I explain but that the thing is easy and 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.190
 we have to recycle before then because 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 example because you can not recycle because 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.180
 there were no such things then all the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.180
 garbage was gathered in the same container 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.150
 and that's why they stopped containers and 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.250
 from there then inclusion or the theme 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.570
 of containers therefore in the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.060
 containers now they come 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.880
 different colors so you know 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.669
 differentiate organic matter from what 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.340
 which are plastic bottles packaging 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.780
 also aluminum as I will explain now and 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.220
 well, we have to go to the 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.500
 next let's move on to the next 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.569
 because if we're not going to do it fast 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.639
 now we go with the yellow container 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.729
 against the yellow that in what takes 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.289
 against yellow, what they are 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.249
 aerosols also carries what they are 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.369
 plastic glitter plastics or also 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.479
 this also the plastic bottle that 

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:02.509
 is what I wanted to say 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:06.020
 steve a lot of people and now more and more 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.119
 because only on the issue of the plugs 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.039
 so you can recycle and 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:12.860
 putting together many plugs, then do what 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.559
 which are benefit campaigns and these 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.689
 things and from then on you can 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.330
 What it does is measure the ones they cover in the 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.490
 sides and can be recycled although it is 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.379
 very important the issue of recycling 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.659
 types of plugs and these things is 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.659
 important also that it recycles and I 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.599
 I have always seen normal and well that 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.119
 recycle these types of things too 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.330
 we have the blue container that this 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:40.879
 I have here and here we have it here 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.240
 double bass is what has been found 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.580
 in your bar what are the newspapers that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.330
 can be cartons and these things go in 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.199
 the container 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.990
 rajoy because this magazine could in the 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.810
 blue container would be here I want 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.509
 do this would be the contract where 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.520
 we go carton papers and these things and 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.940
 then the container 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.270
 this green breaker that where do they go as 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.830
 I said before what glasses are like 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.610
 they can be glass bottles and these 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.069
 things in the green blue container sorry 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.470
 and then what I wanted to explain with 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.840
 this is that we have to recycle a lot 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.909
 people do not recycle and we have to look at 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.039
 things on the positive side we have to 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.990
 look for the environment we have to 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.430
 know that we have to recycle that before 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.400
 they did not recycle because they did not know 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.770
 so then I'm evolving and it's 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.909
 important the issue of recycling can already 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.250
 be for the environment by 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.539
 keep it because there is no more medium 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.819
 environment for example bottles of 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.770
 plastic there are many but for example the 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.740
 environment there is only one already 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.780
 from that one then everything goes out 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.400
 everything I mean here comes out in what is 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.430
 nature food products 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.810
 and good and another day I'll talk about one more topic 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.789
 of the food products that 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.150
 we have to look for healthy food 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:01.469
 because there is only one nothing because 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.620
 you can see the transgenic products 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.240
 which are products that have been 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.979
 made with fertilizers these things 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.150
 and it's not good we have to consume 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.890
 products 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.140
 and these things but what I want 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.090
 explain is that we have to recycle that 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.940
 It can be with bags even if we do not have 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.250
 bags in each container because there 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.410
 containers that are / yellow in your 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.450
 green and these things and we do not have 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.970
 containers does not mean that no 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.860
 we can recycle we can do it using 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.850
 different types of bags as I have done 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.350
 with the partridge such site another such site and 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.410
 We do not have to, we do not need 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.120
 containers to be able to recycle with that 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.860
 thank you very much to all the favorite 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.720
 if you liked it and if anybody has a 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.120
 tutorial that we would like him to do 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.680
 put it in what that has been said 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.090
 thank you very much for the amount of 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.530
 our price for last tortillas 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.630
 hour subscribe to my channel very many 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.630
 thanks and a strong hug to you
