00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 in times as welcome to one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.740
 another skin spotlight on the pc 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.120
 server and here we have the rotter it 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 looks a bit burgraul moderate 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.929
 out with hey where the armor and here 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 we have to agree in comparison 90 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 go and the classic look us that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.000
 Exactly on the bow looks pretty 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 pretty luscious from just awesome again 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 Lights much better in detail 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 and more dangerous than that of the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.750
 classic edge also bright as saying 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 she just looks aggressive and not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.570
 more sweet as we know her 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.829
 opposite directly to your abilities 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 and first with the control 1 since 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.469
 shows you with the war it has 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.530
 pretty much simultaneous happens both 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.219
 throw the ball away and laugh 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.350
 two of the sound quasi mocking 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.719
 aesch, too, that's completely the same 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 turns around a little at leipzig 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.289
 the psyche and a keks the happy 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 dance is not quite as erotic as that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.590
 maybe from a miss fortune knows 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.360
 but it has at least a super horny 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 arc the laugh that also equal sake 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 so short or sweet the animations 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.369
 are the same if we are ours now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 active have frost arrows 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 that's how they look like and that's how they look 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.990
 Also shot at the other means you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
 would have to reactivate with ours too 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.640
 nothing really changed here we see 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 So just that the optics of it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.420
 everyone else has changed 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.060
 abilities remained the same 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.140
 that means she would cost the child 750 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.050
 and thus relatively easy to get 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.690
 his 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.730
 the multi also does not like that unfortunately 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.550
 other color not like boppard 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.320
 cas go but still that is something 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.000
 for the smaller purse 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 Now let's have a look at the ricoh 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 innovation office does not offer if 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.330
 then we really see that's the same 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 it with a slightly different optic for the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.900
 x 50 clock instead of soon on the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.130
 liveserver not stated 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.780
 they're trying too cold now 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.180
 but it will not be until next time 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.180
 next to yours is a kepi's fine
