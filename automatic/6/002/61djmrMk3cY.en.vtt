that cut so as it comes in if I'm
properly<00:00:52.320> trained<00:00:52.650> I'll<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.460> attack<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
properly trained I'll know and attack it

my<00:00:54.120> head<00:00:54.390> especially<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> simple

my head especially a simple

my head especially a simple
straightforward<00:00:55.769> attack<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> isn't

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
straightforward attack like that isn't

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.119 
straightforward attack like that isn't
likely<00:00:57.540> to<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.870> through<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:58.680> likely<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
likely to get through and is likely to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.070 
likely to get through and is likely to
be<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.309> gambit<00:00:59.790> trying<00:01:00.299> to<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> me<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.690> expose

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.890 

so<00:01:07.400> I'm<00:01:07.549> going<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.500> withdraw<00:01:09.500> myself<00:01:10.450> as<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
so I'm going to withdraw myself as the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.830 
so I'm going to withdraw myself as the
cutter<00:01:12.140> comes<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.710> move<00:01:13.100> around<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> side

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
cutter comes in move around to the side

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.280 
cutter comes in move around to the side
and<00:01:15.200> cut<00:01:15.740> over<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.040> top<00:01:16.430> of<00:01:16.460> bill<00:01:16.880> shield

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and cut over the top of bill shield

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.870 
and cut over the top of bill shield
notice<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.409> haven't<00:01:18.590> left<00:01:18.860> my<00:01:19.070> legs<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:19.700> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
notice I haven't left my legs there I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.940 
notice I haven't left my legs there I
have<00:01:20.210> simultaneously<00:01:23.470> moved<00:01:24.470> out<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.920> way

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
have simultaneously moved out of the way

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.010 
have simultaneously moved out of the way
and<00:01:25.640> put<00:01:25.820> myself<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.390> good<00:01:26.509> position<00:01:26.720> to

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
and put myself in a good position to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.670 
and put myself in a good position to
counter-attack<00:01:28.720> since<00:01:29.720> both<00:01:30.049> of<00:01:30.259> us<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.530> had

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
counter-attack since both of us have had

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.499 
counter-attack since both of us have had
a<00:01:30.710> little<00:01:30.920> bit<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.189> training<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:33.759> see<00:01:34.759> my<00:01:34.970> target

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
a little bit of training I see my target

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.560 
a little bit of training I see my target
thanks<00:01:36.380> disappear<00:01:37.159> I'm<00:01:37.850> not<00:01:38.030> gonna<00:01:38.149> go<00:01:38.360> there

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
thanks disappear I'm not gonna go there

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.090 
thanks disappear I'm not gonna go there
anymore<00:01:38.750> I'm<00:01:39.140> gonna<00:01:39.319> try<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.560> find<00:01:39.800> another

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
anymore I'm gonna try to find another

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.270 
anymore I'm gonna try to find another
target<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.640> know<00:01:41.569> where<00:01:42.530> our<00:01:42.560> market<00:01:43.039> ever

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
target I know where our market ever

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100 
target I know where our market ever
rough<00:01:43.670> idea<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.060> where<00:01:44.210> our<00:01:44.479> sword<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.929> like

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
rough idea of where our sword is like

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.960 
rough idea of where our sword is like
Lindsey<00:01:45.470> I'm<00:01:45.920> gonna<00:01:46.130> guess<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.549> attack<00:01:46.819> is

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
Lindsey I'm gonna guess the attack is

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.460 
Lindsey I'm gonna guess the attack is
gonna<00:01:47.090> be<00:01:47.360> coming<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:47.899> some<00:01:48.049> place<00:01:48.200> over

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
gonna be coming up in some place over

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.770 
gonna be coming up in some place over
here<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.220> need<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.729> get<00:01:49.940> my<00:01:50.149> defense<00:01:50.509> over

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
here so I need to get my defense over

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:00.309 
here so I need to get my defense over
there<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:59.420> didn't<00:01:59.690> work<00:01:59.780> very<00:01:59.840> well<00:02:00.049> for

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
there that didn't work very well for

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.539 
there that didn't work very well for
either<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.590> us<00:02:00.709> let's<00:02:00.979> try<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:01.280> again<00:02:01.340> a

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
either of us let's try that again a

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.890 
either of us let's try that again a
little<00:02:01.640> bit<00:02:01.850> slower

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
little bit slower

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.390 
little bit slower
during<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.990> crust<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.530> face<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.009> raised

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
during the crust of the face I raised

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.820 
during the crust of the face I raised
but<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.820> expect<00:02:07.270> him<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.450> go<00:02:07.689> low<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.259> then

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
but I expect him to go low and then

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.250 
but I expect him to go low and then
comes<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.090> step<00:02:10.360> away<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.810> cut<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
comes on the step away and cut to the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
comes on the step away and cut to the
head
