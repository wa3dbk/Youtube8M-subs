biggest issue that people have had at

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.709 
biggest issue that people have had at
this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.410> only<00:00:49.700> lights<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this is that it only lights up on one

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.930 
this is that it only lights up on one
side<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.309> bothered<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> lot

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
side so that bothered me a lot

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.200 
side so that bothered me a lot
so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> fixed<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> added<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> secondary

so I fixed it and so I added a secondary
led<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.750> replaced<00:01:00.989> both<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> them<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
led actually replaced both of them so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
led actually replaced both of them so
the<00:01:01.649> same<00:01:02.070> brightness<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.760> both<00:01:03.629> sides<00:01:03.899> light

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

I'll do that I also walk these in place
I<00:01:44.530> didn't<00:01:44.710> like<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.920> fact<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.130> they<00:01:45.280> flip

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
I didn't like the fact that they flip

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.059 
I didn't like the fact that they flip
down<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.600> am<00:01:46.810> hold<00:01:46.990> them<00:01:47.110> up<00:01:47.289> more<00:01:47.500> because

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
down and I am hold them up more because

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.380 
down and I am hold them up more because
when<00:01:48.340> looking<00:01:48.579> at<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.789> originals<00:01:49.060> are<00:01:49.149> groans

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
when looking at the originals are groans

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.669 
when looking at the originals are groans
in<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.600> big<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.079> thing<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.380> bothers<00:01:50.649> me

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
in the big one the thing that bothers me

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.760 
in the big one the thing that bothers me
the<00:01:50.890> most<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:52.240> pitch<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:53.200> these<00:01:53.409> they're

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the most is the pitch of these they're

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.249 
the most is the pitch of these they're
at<00:01:54.069> a<00:01:54.130> down<00:01:54.369> angle<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.909> really<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.959> didn't

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
at a down angle and really just didn't

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.569 
at a down angle and really just didn't
make<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.469> seem<00:01:56.560> like<00:01:56.709> a<00:01:56.740> sort<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.009> almost<00:01:57.189> and

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
make it seem like a sort of almost and

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.370 
make it seem like a sort of almost and
so<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:57.969> fixed<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.539> on<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.719> one<00:01:58.899> so<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.229> is

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
so like fixed it on this one so this is

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:20.880 
so like fixed it on this one so this is
pretty<00:01:59.590> much<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.510> yeah<00:02:19.599> it's<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.590> anybody

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
pretty much so yeah it's if anybody

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.809 
pretty much so yeah it's if anybody
wants<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.130> go<00:02:21.220> out<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.400> be<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.760> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
wants to go out and be that it's a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.449 
wants to go out and be that it's a
really<00:02:22.239> really<00:02:23.079> easy<00:02:23.110> modification<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459

get LEDs like a dollar piece resolder

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.030 
get LEDs like a dollar piece resolder
them<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.810> took<00:02:28.810> me<00:02:28.930> five<00:02:29.319> minutes<00:02:29.470> tops
