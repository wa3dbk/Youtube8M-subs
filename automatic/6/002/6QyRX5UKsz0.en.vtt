little<00:02:40.750> slot<00:02:41.110> over<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.970> star<00:02:43.240> foam

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
little slot over here in the star foam

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.840 
little slot over here in the star foam
so<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.230> want<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> motor<00:02:44.770> unit<00:02:45.130> located<00:02:45.310> over

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
so you want the motor unit located over

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.970 
so you want the motor unit located over
here<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.960> is<00:02:47.140> where<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.530> cord<00:02:47.800> will

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
here and this is where the cord will

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.760 
here and this is where the cord will
come<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.390> again<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.960> talked<00:02:50.290> about<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
come out again we talked about the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.100 
come out again we talked about the
inside<00:02:51.190> parts<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> unit<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> lid

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
inside parts of the unit this is the lid

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.450 
inside parts of the unit this is the lid
and<00:02:56.110> there<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:58.080> beveled<00:02:59.080> edge<00:02:59.200> here<00:02:59.680> we<00:03:00.250> want

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
and there is a beveled edge here we want

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.890 
and there is a beveled edge here we want
to<00:03:00.490> try<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.360> corner<00:03:01.630> over

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
to try to get that in the corner over

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.440 
to try to get that in the corner over
here<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:03.070> our<00:03:03.160> turning<00:03:03.550> cord<00:03:03.820> can<00:03:04.060> come<00:03:04.270> out<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
here so our turning cord can come out so

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.510 
here so our turning cord can come out so
we<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:07.870> our<00:03:08.050> unit<00:03:08.410> assemble<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.220> way<00:03:09.340> we

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
we have our unit assemble the way we

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.570 
we have our unit assemble the way we
want<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.770> what<00:03:11.770> we<00:03:11.920> would<00:03:12.040> want<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
want it what we would want to do the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.350 
want it what we would want to do the
first<00:03:12.790> day<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.450> plug<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.020> unit<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:15.240> put<00:03:16.240> our

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
first day is plug the unit in put our

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.610 
first day is plug the unit in put our

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
thermometer put our thermometer lay it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.800 
thermometer put our thermometer lay it
out<00:03:20.770> flat<00:03:21.100> here<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:22.060> we<00:03:22.180> can<00:03:22.300> see<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
out flat here so we can see it in the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.380 
out flat here so we can see it in the
window<00:03:22.990> we<00:03:23.980> want<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.250> plug<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.610> unit<00:03:24.760> in<00:03:25.090> and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
window we want to plug the unit in and

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.930 
window we want to plug the unit in and
then<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.650> first<00:03:26.860> day<00:03:27.130> we<00:03:27.370> want<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.670> try<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
then for the first day we want to try to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.300 
then for the first day we want to try to
get<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.420> temperature<00:03:29.110> at<00:03:29.410> about<00:03:29.739> ninety

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
get that temperature at about ninety

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.840 
get that temperature at about ninety
nine<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> half<00:03:30.850> degrees<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.739> once<00:03:33.640> it's

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
nine and a half degrees so once it's

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.490 
nine and a half degrees so once it's
plugged<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.360> we<00:03:34.630> can<00:03:34.840> move<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.760> thermostat

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
plugged in we can move this thermostat

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.790 
plugged in we can move this thermostat
or<00:03:38.500> wafer<00:03:39.040> unit<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.930> we<00:03:41.080> want<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> increase<00:03:41.739> it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
or wafer unit if we want to increase it

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.440 
or wafer unit if we want to increase it
there's<00:03:42.250> an<00:03:42.370> arrow<00:03:42.550> here<00:03:42.850> showing<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.209> how<00:03:43.420> to

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
there's an arrow here showing you how to

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.800 
there's an arrow here showing you how to
increase<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.110> heat<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:46.030> heat<00:03:46.270> was<00:03:46.570> not

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
increase the heat so if the heat was not

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.130 
increase the heat so if the heat was not
if<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:48.040> was<00:03:48.220> 95<00:03:48.910> degrees<00:03:49.330> I<00:03:49.540> know<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.750> need<00:03:49.989> to

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
if it was 95 degrees I know I need to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.199 
if it was 95 degrees I know I need to
increase<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.980> I'm<00:03:51.130> gonna<00:03:51.250> experiment<00:03:51.850> and

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
increase it so I'm gonna experiment and

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.830 
increase it so I'm gonna experiment and
just<00:03:52.360> turn<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.780> up<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:53.019> much<00:03:54.420> use<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.630> lock

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
just turn it up this much use the lock

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.509 
just turn it up this much use the lock
nut<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.320> hold<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:56.860> place<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.400> doesn't

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
nut to hold it in place so it doesn't

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.030 
nut to hold it in place so it doesn't
move<00:03:57.880> on<00:03:58.239> me<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> then<00:03:59.530> I'm<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.830> come

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
move on me and then I'm going to come

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
move on me and then I'm going to come
back<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.459> about<00:04:00.670> an<00:04:00.820> hour<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.360> check<00:04:01.600> that

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
back in about an hour and check that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.080 
back in about an hour and check that
temperature<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.739> we've<00:04:02.950> tested<00:04:03.190> out<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.550> unit

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
temperature so we've tested out the unit

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.590 
temperature so we've tested out the unit
we've<00:04:04.450> for<00:04:05.410> two<00:04:06.160> or<00:04:06.280> three<00:04:06.459> days<00:04:06.489> we<00:04:07.060> think<00:04:07.360> we

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
we've for two or three days we think we

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600 
we've for two or three days we think we
have<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.870> regulated<00:04:08.680> about<00:04:08.950> where<00:04:09.160> we<00:04:09.280> want<00:04:09.519> it

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
have it regulated about where we want it

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.280 
have it regulated about where we want it
so<00:04:09.940> now<00:04:10.209> we're<00:04:10.480> going<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.630> take<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> cup<00:04:11.260> of

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
so now we're going to take a cup of

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.680 
so now we're going to take a cup of
water<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.840> cup<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:14.110> water<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:15.060> just<00:04:16.060> pour

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
water and one cup of water and just pour

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.630 
water and one cup of water and just pour
the<00:04:16.840> cup<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.169> water<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.650> this<00:04:17.890> trough<00:04:18.220> just

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
the cup of water in this trough just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.940 
the cup of water in this trough just
kind<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:19.859> move<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:20.980> around<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.640> it'll<00:04:22.000> it'll

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
kind of move it around and it'll it'll

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.340 
kind of move it around and it'll it'll
even<00:04:23.950> out<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> bottom<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.180> tray<00:04:25.450> so

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
even out in the bottom of the tray so

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.710 
even out in the bottom of the tray so
one<00:04:26.560> cup<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.830> water<00:04:27.100> there<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.850> you'll<00:04:28.510> need

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
one cup of water there and you'll need

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.750 
one cup of water there and you'll need
to<00:04:28.840> do<00:04:28.990> this<00:04:29.169> about<00:04:29.410> two<00:04:29.800> times<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.250> week<00:04:30.280> add<00:04:30.700> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
to do this about two times a week add a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.640 
to do this about two times a week add a
cup<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.120> water<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:31.960> provides<00:04:32.410> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
cup of water and this provides the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.900 
cup of water and this provides the
moisture<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:34.330> needs<00:04:34.600> that

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
moisture it needs that

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.280 
moisture it needs that
moisture<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.420> order<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.780> hatch<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.200> eggs

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
moisture in order to hatch the eggs

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.120 
moisture in order to hatch the eggs
properly<00:04:36.620> if<00:04:37.130> we're<00:04:37.310> using<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.940> turning<00:04:38.630> rack

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
properly if we're using the turning rack

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.580 
properly if we're using the turning rack
we're<00:04:40.130> going<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.310> place<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.820> in<00:04:40.970> here<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.590> put

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
we're going to place it in here and put

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.870 
we're going to place it in here and put
our<00:04:42.710> eggs<00:04:43.040> in<00:04:44.140> here<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:48.050> we're<00:04:48.290> going<00:04:48.530> to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
our eggs in here that we're going to

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.560 
our eggs in here that we're going to
hatch<00:04:50.530> they<00:04:51.530> fit<00:04:51.800> right<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> top<00:04:52.700> you<00:04:53.360> want

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
hatch they fit right in the top you want

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.700 
hatch they fit right in the top you want
the<00:04:53.720> pointy<00:04:54.170> end<00:04:54.380> down<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:56.630> rounded<00:04:57.170> top<00:04:57.380> goes

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the pointy end down the rounded top goes

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.640 
the pointy end down the rounded top goes
to<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.010> top<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.640> try<00:04:59.150> to<00:04:59.180> look<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.230> see<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
to the top so you try to look to see the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.770 
to the top so you try to look to see the
pointed<00:05:01.100> end<00:05:01.280> down<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.850> goes<00:05:02.060> down<00:05:02.360> if

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
pointed end down that goes down if

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.560 
pointed end down that goes down if
you're<00:05:03.260> going<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.800> use<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.550> machine<00:05:05.360> without

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
you're going to use the machine without

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.650 
you're going to use the machine without
a<00:05:05.750> turning<00:05:06.230> rack<00:05:06.880> basically<00:05:07.880> you<00:05:08.090> just<00:05:08.120> put

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
a turning rack basically you just put

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.630 
a turning rack basically you just put
the<00:05:08.900> eggs<00:05:09.380> lay<00:05:10.280> them<00:05:10.520> down<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.910> here<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.450> then

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the eggs lay them down in here and then

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.150 
the eggs lay them down in here and then
every<00:05:13.640> day<00:05:13.910> or<00:05:14.840> twice<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.290> day<00:05:15.650> you'll<00:05:15.860> need<00:05:16.040> to

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
every day or twice a day you'll need to

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.070 
every day or twice a day you'll need to
open<00:05:16.490> up<00:05:16.640> the<00:05:16.760> unit<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.330> move<00:05:17.600> that<00:05:17.810> just

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
open up the unit and move that just

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.900 
open up the unit and move that just
gently<00:05:18.380> move<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.800> eggs<00:05:19.010> around<00:05:19.400> turn<00:05:19.730> them

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
gently move the eggs around turn them

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730 
gently move the eggs around turn them
over<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> other<00:05:20.240> way<00:05:20.570> so<00:05:20.990> let's<00:05:21.200> assume<00:05:21.530> we're

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
over the other way so let's assume we're

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.680 
over the other way so let's assume we're
going<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:21.920> use<00:05:22.100> the<00:05:22.280> turning<00:05:22.610> rack<00:05:22.850> we're

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
going to use the turning rack we're

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.990 
going to use the turning rack we're
putting<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.230> in<00:05:24.350> here<00:05:24.650> we're<00:05:25.430> gonna<00:05:25.490> put<00:05:25.850> the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
putting it in here we're gonna put the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.020 
putting it in here we're gonna put the
eggs<00:05:26.210> in<00:05:26.540> here<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.350> if<00:05:28.100> we're<00:05:28.250> not<00:05:28.280> filling<00:05:28.880> it

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
eggs in here and if we're not filling it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.540 
eggs in here and if we're not filling it
up<00:05:29.180> we<00:05:29.450> need<00:05:29.600> to<00:05:29.720> kind<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.170> put<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:31.010> eggs<00:05:31.250> out

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
up we need to kind of put the eggs out

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.610 
up we need to kind of put the eggs out
evenly<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:33.650> diversify<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.610> heat<00:05:35.350> and<00:05:36.350> then

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
evenly to diversify the heat and then

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.260 
evenly to diversify the heat and then
also<00:05:36.950> so<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.280> turning<00:05:37.610> rack<00:05:37.790> will<00:05:38.060> turn

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
also so the turning rack will turn

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.930 
also so the turning rack will turn
properly<00:05:38.690> so<00:05:39.680> if<00:05:39.800> it's<00:05:39.950> not<00:05:40.100> completely<00:05:40.580> full

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
properly so if it's not completely full

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.240 
properly so if it's not completely full
just<00:05:41.870> put<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.200> eggs<00:05:42.700> kind<00:05:43.700> of<00:05:43.820> evenly<00:05:44.300> spaced

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
just put the eggs kind of evenly spaced

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.040 
just put the eggs kind of evenly spaced
I'll<00:05:46.250> put<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.580> unit<00:05:46.910> back<00:05:46.940> on<00:05:49.780> assuming<00:05:50.780> we

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
I'll put the unit back on assuming we

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.300 
I'll put the unit back on assuming we
have<00:05:51.080> our<00:05:51.410> eggs<00:05:51.680> in<00:05:51.950> there

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
have our eggs in there

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.510 
have our eggs in there
we<00:05:52.460> want<00:05:52.669> to<00:05:52.730> plug<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:54.320> heating<00:05:55.070> element

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
we want to plug in the heating element

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.750 
we want to plug in the heating element
we<00:05:55.700> want<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:55.970> plug<00:05:56.150> in<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.510> Turner<00:05:57.400> and<00:05:58.400> we

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
we want to plug in the Turner and we

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.990 
we want to plug in the Turner and we
want<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.210> have<00:05:59.480> our<00:05:59.720> thermometer<00:06:00.610> we<00:06:01.610> can<00:06:01.790> lay

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
want to have our thermometer we can lay

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.620 
want to have our thermometer we can lay
it<00:06:02.270> on<00:06:02.540> top<00:06:02.600> of<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.230> eggs<00:06:03.910> so<00:06:04.910> we<00:06:04.940> can<00:06:05.210> see<00:06:05.480> it

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
it on top of the eggs so we can see it

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.510 
it on top of the eggs so we can see it
and<00:06:05.870> we<00:06:05.990> want<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.260> watch<00:06:06.440> that<00:06:06.470> adjustment<00:06:07.340> for

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
and we want to watch that adjustment for

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.550 
and we want to watch that adjustment for
the<00:06:07.580> first<00:06:07.820> couple<00:06:08.450> of<00:06:08.600> days<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:09.080> make<00:06:09.260> sure

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
the first couple of days to make sure

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.880 
the first couple of days to make sure
the<00:06:10.100> temperature<00:06:10.340> regulates<00:06:11.300> now<00:06:11.780> do<00:06:12.740> not

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
the temperature regulates now do not

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.590 
the temperature regulates now do not
touch<00:06:13.250> this<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:14.780> may<00:06:15.110> take<00:06:15.910> 12<00:06:16.910> hours<00:06:17.120> for<00:06:17.510> it

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
touch this it may take 12 hours for it

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.150 
touch this it may take 12 hours for it
to<00:06:17.630> get<00:06:17.840> regulated<00:06:18.200> back<00:06:18.650> up<00:06:18.890> to<00:06:19.070> the

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
to get regulated back up to the

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.070 
to get regulated back up to the
temperature<00:06:19.640> that<00:06:19.669> you<00:06:19.880> had<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.330> set<00:06:20.630> because

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
temperature that you had it set because

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.070 
temperature that you had it set because
the<00:06:21.260> eggs<00:06:21.560> are<00:06:21.940> cool<00:06:22.940> it<00:06:23.480> takes<00:06:23.750> a<00:06:23.870> while<00:06:24.020> for

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
the eggs are cool it takes a while for

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.220 
the eggs are cool it takes a while for
them<00:06:24.350> to<00:06:24.500> get<00:06:24.650> warm<00:06:25.660> so<00:06:26.660> it'll<00:06:26.870> take<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.050> little

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
them to get warm so it'll take a little

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.140 
them to get warm so it'll take a little
while<00:06:27.350> for<00:06:27.470> the<00:06:27.650> unit<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.100> get<00:06:28.220> heated<00:06:28.490> up<00:06:28.730> but

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
while for the unit to get heated up but

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.530 
while for the unit to get heated up but
again<00:06:29.419> use<00:06:29.660> this<00:06:29.840> as<00:06:30.080> your<00:06:30.260> guide<00:06:30.820> on<00:06:31.820> the<00:06:32.000> 18th

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
again use this as your guide on the 18th

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.300 
again use this as your guide on the 18th
day<00:06:32.660> if<00:06:33.050> you're<00:06:33.200> doing<00:06:33.380> chicken<00:06:33.710> eggs<00:06:34.040> they

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
day if you're doing chicken eggs they

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.730 
day if you're doing chicken eggs they
hatch<00:06:34.550> out<00:06:34.820> in<00:06:34.940> 21<00:06:35.360> days<00:06:35.600> so<00:06:35.930> three<00:06:36.200> days<00:06:36.380> prior

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
hatch out in 21 days so three days prior

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.180 
hatch out in 21 days so three days prior
to<00:06:36.890> their<00:06:37.280> hatch<00:06:37.520> date<00:06:38.110> you<00:06:39.110> want<00:06:39.410> to<00:06:39.680> remove

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
to their hatch date you want to remove

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.880 
to their hatch date you want to remove
the<00:06:40.460> Turner<00:06:40.730> rack<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.450> just<00:06:41.870> put<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.230> eggs<00:06:42.470> on

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
the Turner rack and just put the eggs on

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.590 
the Turner rack and just put the eggs on
the<00:06:43.070> bottom<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:43.669> then<00:06:43.970> you'll<00:06:44.150> want<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.419> take

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
the bottom and then you'll want to take

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.600 
the bottom and then you'll want to take
your<00:06:44.750> eggs<00:06:45.050> and<00:06:45.380> just<00:06:45.560> lay<00:06:45.800> them<00:06:46.039> on<00:06:46.310> the

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
your eggs and just lay them on the

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.640 
your eggs and just lay them on the
bottom<00:06:46.789> here
