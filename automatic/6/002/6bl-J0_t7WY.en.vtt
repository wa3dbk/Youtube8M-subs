purpose was to make more bees and make
more<00:04:12.220> hives<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.480> actually<00:04:13.660> went<00:04:13.989> from<00:04:14.230> one

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
more hives so I actually went from one

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.610 
more hives so I actually went from one
to<00:04:14.829> three<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.790> that's<00:04:16.780> what's<00:04:17.019> up<00:04:17.139> there<00:04:17.380> now

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
to three and that's what's up there now

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.310 
to three and that's what's up there now
okay<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:18.910> can<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.239> take<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.780> tell<00:04:20.049> Emma

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
okay and so can you take a you tell Emma

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.909 
okay and so can you take a you tell Emma
a<00:04:20.590> moment<00:04:21.010> explain<00:04:21.790> how<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.690> workers<00:04:22.990> decide

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
a moment explain how the workers decide

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.150 
a moment explain how the workers decide
about<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.270> queen<00:04:25.690> how<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.320> they<00:04:26.530> get<00:04:26.650> them<00:04:26.860> queen

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
about a queen how do they get them queen

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.480 
about a queen how do they get them queen
cells<00:04:27.520> going<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:29.560> different<00:04:29.950> kinds<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
cells going and the different kinds of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.690 
cells going and the different kinds of
Queen<00:04:31.150> cells<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:32.500> appear<00:04:32.950> in<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.160> hive

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
Queen cells that appear in a hive

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.219 
Queen cells that appear in a hive
what's<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> difference<00:04:34.510> between<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.780> swarm

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
what's the difference between a swarm

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.920 
what's the difference between a swarm
cell<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:37.450> what<00:04:37.570> they<00:04:37.690> call<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
cell and and what they call a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.100 
cell and and what they call a
superseding<00:04:38.650> cell<00:04:39.130> okay<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.270> when<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.930> bees

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
superseding cell okay so when the bees

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.440 
superseding cell okay so when the bees
are<00:04:41.320> going<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:41.530> supersede<00:04:42.190> okay<00:04:43.120> all<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.419> a

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
are going to supersede okay all of a

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.719 
are going to supersede okay all of a
sudden<00:04:43.780> they<00:04:43.870> decide<00:04:44.100> whatever<00:04:45.100> reason

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
sudden they decide whatever reason

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.830 
sudden they decide whatever reason
Queens<00:04:46.570> not<00:04:46.840> living<00:04:47.229> up<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.380> her<00:04:48.130> reputation

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
Queens not living up to her reputation

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.050 
Queens not living up to her reputation
it's<00:04:49.840> not<00:04:49.990> laying<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.410> up<00:04:50.530> egg<00:04:50.789> maybe<00:04:51.789> she's

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
it's not laying it up egg maybe she's

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.150 
it's not laying it up egg maybe she's
got<00:04:52.240> some<00:04:52.510> tattered<00:04:52.900> wings<00:04:53.139> who<00:04:53.410> knows<00:04:53.650> they

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
got some tattered wings who knows they

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.940 
got some tattered wings who knows they
decide<00:04:54.550> it's<00:04:54.760> time<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.000> raise<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.389> new<00:04:55.660> queen

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
decide it's time to raise a new queen

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.710 
decide it's time to raise a new queen
they'll<00:04:56.950> make<00:04:57.220> a<00:04:57.250> queen<00:04:57.610> cell<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.180> typically

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
they'll make a queen cell and typically

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.200 
they'll make a queen cell and typically
it's<00:04:58.990> up<00:04:59.229> in<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.800> top<00:05:00.070> half<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.639> frame<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it's up in the top half of the frame the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.140 
it's up in the top half of the frame the
top<00:05:01.450> third<00:05:02.169> of<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.440> frame<00:05:02.760> okay<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:04.030> you

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
top third of the frame okay and you

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.719 
top third of the frame okay and you
sticks<00:05:04.570> out<00:05:04.750> like<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.930> little<00:05:05.139> peanut<00:05:05.639> when<00:05:06.639> you

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
sticks out like a little peanut when you

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.420 
sticks out like a little peanut when you
have<00:05:06.910> swarm<00:05:07.300> cells<00:05:07.690> those<00:05:08.560> Queen<00:05:08.889> cells<00:05:09.220> are

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
have swarm cells those Queen cells are

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.770 
have swarm cells those Queen cells are
all<00:05:09.610> going<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.880> be<00:05:10.000> at<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.240> bottom<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:10.720> the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
all going to be at the bottom of the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.860 
all going to be at the bottom of the
frame<00:05:11.050> down<00:05:11.620> here<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:13.300> that's<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.690> difference

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
frame down here so that's the difference

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.440 
frame down here so that's the difference
if<00:05:14.169> you<00:05:14.320> open<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.740> up<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.160> see<00:05:15.460> Queen

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
if you open it up and you see Queen

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.280 
if you open it up and you see Queen
cells<00:05:16.780> at<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> bottom<00:05:17.260> here

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
cells at the bottom here

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.740 
cells at the bottom here
your<00:05:18.770> hive<00:05:18.950> has<00:05:19.280> probably<00:05:19.940> already<00:05:20.030> sworn

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
your hive has probably already sworn

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.590 
your hive has probably already sworn
that's<00:05:20.960> happened<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.440> me<00:05:21.500> twice<00:05:21.860> but<00:05:22.360> if<00:05:23.360> not

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
that's happened to me twice but if not

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
it's getting ready so again to me those

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.100 
it's getting ready so again to me those
are<00:05:29.300> free<00:05:29.720> Queens<00:05:30.130> right<00:05:31.330> so<00:05:32.330> when<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.630> open<00:05:33.050> it

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
are free Queens right so when I open it

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.320 
are free Queens right so when I open it
up<00:05:33.230> and<00:05:33.410> I<00:05:33.530> see<00:05:33.770> swarm<00:05:34.190> cells<00:05:34.490> my<00:05:34.850> eyes<00:05:35.000> light

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
up and I see swarm cells my eyes light

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.420 
up and I see swarm cells my eyes light
up<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.660> go<00:05:35.870> free<00:05:36.140> Queens<00:05:36.470> I'm<00:05:36.890> going<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.280> make

up I go free Queens I'm going to make

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.640 
up I go free Queens I'm going to make
some<00:05:37.640> more<00:05:37.850> more<00:05:38.510> Queens<00:05:38.870> out<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.200> those<00:05:39.320> right

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
some more more Queens out of those right

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.310 
some more more Queens out of those right
yeah<00:05:40.130> exactly<00:05:40.910> that's<00:05:41.300> what<00:05:41.570> my<00:05:41.780> friend<00:05:42.110> Joe

again now think about it a super seizure

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.050 
again now think about it a super seizure
cell<00:05:51.140> that's<00:05:51.860> going<00:05:52.040> to<00:05:52.220> give<00:05:52.400> you<00:05:52.550> a<00:05:52.580> good

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
cell that's going to give you a good

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.530 
cell that's going to give you a good
queen<00:05:53.450> because<00:05:54.350> they<00:05:54.560> decided<00:05:54.950> early<00:05:55.610> on<00:05:55.640> that

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
queen because they decided early on that

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.050 
queen because they decided early on that
one<00:05:56.870> is<00:05:57.200> going<00:05:57.380> to<00:05:57.440> be<00:05:57.590> our<00:05:57.770> queen<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:58.790> she's

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.450 
now all the bees get royal jelly for the
first<00:06:05.630> couple<00:06:05.870> of<00:06:06.050> days<00:06:06.290> but<00:06:06.710> on<00:06:06.830> day<00:06:07.070> three

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
first couple of days but on day three

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.730 
first couple of days but on day three
they<00:06:07.670> cut<00:06:07.910> them<00:06:08.000> off<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:08.960> cut<00:06:09.170> them<00:06:09.320> off<00:06:09.440> those

they cut them off and cut them off those

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.360 
they cut them off and cut them off those
become<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.160> workers<00:06:10.760> so<00:06:11.690> now<00:06:11.930> if<00:06:12.350> you<00:06:12.740> take<00:06:12.770> a

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
become the workers so now if you take a

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.850 
become the workers so now if you take a
frame<00:06:13.880> that's<00:06:14.150> got<00:06:14.360> eggs<00:06:14.600> on<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:15.110> and<00:06:15.380> maybe

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
frame that's got eggs on it and maybe

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.670 
frame that's got eggs on it and maybe
little<00:06:16.250> larvae<00:06:16.640> on<00:06:16.850> it<00:06:17.260> they<00:06:18.260> can<00:06:18.440> raise<00:06:18.650> a

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
little larvae on it they can raise a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.090 
little larvae on it they can raise a
queen<00:06:19.070> from<00:06:19.430> it<00:06:19.750> but<00:06:20.750> a<00:06:21.020> lot<00:06:21.440> of<00:06:21.500> times<00:06:21.860> are

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
queen from it but a lot of times are

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.610 
queen from it but a lot of times are
sometimes<00:06:22.610> those<00:06:23.060> Queens<00:06:23.390> may<00:06:23.840> not<00:06:24.080> be<00:06:24.350> as

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
sometimes those Queens may not be as

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.740 
sometimes those Queens may not be as
good<00:06:24.980> as<00:06:25.250> the<00:06:25.490> Queen's<00:06:25.790> from<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.120> super<00:06:26.480> seizure

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
good as the Queen's from a super seizure

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.700 
good as the Queen's from a super seizure
cell<00:06:27.200> because<00:06:28.330> they<00:06:29.330> may<00:06:29.780> have<00:06:29.810> had<00:06:30.140> a<00:06:30.170> small

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
cell because they may have had a small

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.830 
cell because they may have had a small
interruption<00:06:31.490> in<00:06:31.700> that<00:06:32.090> time<00:06:32.390> that<00:06:32.570> they<00:06:32.720> were

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
interruption in that time that they were

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.060 
interruption in that time that they were
fed<00:06:33.110> royal<00:06:33.410> jelly<00:06:34.210> correct<00:06:35.210> Stan<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.890> so<00:06:36.890> what

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
fed royal jelly correct Stan and so what

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.980 
fed royal jelly correct Stan and so what
happens<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.760> you<00:06:37.940> know<00:06:37.970> they've<00:06:38.240> got<00:06:38.270> they've

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
happens is you know they've got they've

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.690 
happens is you know they've got they've
got<00:06:39.020> one<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.650> they<00:06:39.710> picket<00:06:40.040> it<00:06:40.160> after<00:06:40.490> two

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
got one and they picket it after two

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.330 
got one and they picket it after two
days<00:06:40.940> they<00:06:41.780> say<00:06:42.080> oh<00:06:42.110> we<00:06:42.500> need<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.680> make<00:06:42.920> a<00:06:42.950> queen

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
days they say oh we need to make a queen

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.130 
days they say oh we need to make a queen
they<00:06:43.670> start<00:06:43.940> feeding<00:06:44.180> it<00:06:44.390> royal<00:06:44.600> jelly<00:06:44.900> again

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
they start feeding it royal jelly again

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.410 
they start feeding it royal jelly again
and<00:06:45.530> it<00:06:45.950> becomes<00:06:46.280> a<00:06:46.400> queen<00:06:46.670> but<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.120> lot<00:06:47.300> of

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
and it becomes a queen but a lot of

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.900 
and it becomes a queen but a lot of
times<00:06:47.660> it's<00:06:47.930> not<00:06:48.020> as<00:06:48.380> good<00:06:48.590> a<00:06:48.650> queen<00:06:48.980> as<00:06:49.220> if

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
times it's not as good a queen as if

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.250 
times it's not as good a queen as if
they<00:06:50.210> had<00:06:50.360> made<00:06:50.600> one<00:06:50.810> for<00:06:51.020> su<00:06:51.200> procedure<00:06:52.300> right

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
they had made one for su procedure right

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.200 
they had made one for su procedure right
so<00:06:54.710> that's<00:06:54.890> the<00:06:55.070> way<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:55.280> do<00:06:55.490> it<00:06:55.640> is<00:06:55.760> let<00:06:55.970> them

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
so that's the way to do it is let them

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:04.330 
so that's the way to do it is let them
do<00:06:56.450> it<00:06:56.480> themselves

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.400
