tonight<00:00:56.819> right<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:57.929> place<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
tonight right which place to use so it's

not<00:00:59.639> it<00:00:59.969> can't<00:01:00.299> be<00:01:00.510> bad<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.499> that

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
not it can't be bad in that

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
not it can't be bad in that
this<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.040> moping<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.610> you're<00:01:05.850> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this way it's not moping if you're just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
this way it's not moping if you're just
doing<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.570> day<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.500> liquid<00:01:07.770> Steve

traitors put off a week or a month
earlier<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.049> would<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.590> severe<00:01:17.040> unless

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
earlier it would be that severe unless

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.670 
earlier it would be that severe unless
they<00:01:18.330> were<00:01:18.390> contained<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.140> area<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they were contained in that area that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
they were contained in that area that
really<00:01:20.070> important<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.210> option

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
really important that's the only option

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.529 
really important that's the only option
may<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.080> ok<00:01:22.649> just<00:01:22.920> why<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:23.909> prepping<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
may is ok just why you're prepping the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.880 
may is ok just why you're prepping the
bail<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.930> might<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.350> keep<00:01:25.470> them<00:01:25.680> away

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
bail you might want to keep them away

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
bail you might want to keep them away
from<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.750> that's<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.899> real<00:01:28.080> fresh

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
from it because that's the real fresh

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
from it because that's the real fresh
stuff<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> running<00:01:29.280> straight<00:01:29.640> through

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
stuff and it's running straight through

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
stuff and it's running straight through
them<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:30.869> some<00:01:31.440> leaching

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
them and you get to some some leaching

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.309 
them and you get to some some leaching
at<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.789> at<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.119> point<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.140> you're

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
at that can at that point so you're

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.080 
at that can at that point so you're
going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> keep<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.039> fun<00:01:35.280> once<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> get

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
going to keep you much fun once you get

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.719 
going to keep you much fun once you get
to<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.300> point<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.800> I've<00:01:37.920> also<00:01:38.100> done<00:01:38.490> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to this point now what I've also done is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
to this point now what I've also done is
optimizing<00:01:39.300> a<00:01:39.509> semi-circle<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.289> was<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
optimizing a semi-circle I was going to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
optimizing a semi-circle I was going to
take<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:40.890> pictures<00:01:41.310> yesterday<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.360> hand

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
take some pictures yesterday and hand

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.809 
take some pictures yesterday and hand
out<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.350> by<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> day<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.310> rain<00:01:44.550> going

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
out there by the day little rain going

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.820 
out there by the day little rain going
down<00:01:45.060> side<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.560> I've<00:01:46.649> got

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
down side they do that but I've got

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.980 
down side they do that but I've got
small<00:01:47.159> stakes<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.850> mines<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.630> semi-circle

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
small stakes I mines in a semi-circle

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710 
small stakes I mines in a semi-circle
and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> circle<00:01:51.569> it's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and then I got actually a circle it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.990 
and then I got actually a circle it's
about<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> size<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:53.549> courtyard

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
about about the size of this courtyard

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120 
about about the size of this courtyard
