00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.299 
could right here in the trail tech shop
and<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.690> used<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> coolest<00:00:10.440> parts<00:00:10.769> available

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sunk and in need of recovery so this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.660 
sunk and in need of recovery so this
season<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:08.010> thought<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> good

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380

idea to take our build in a different
direction

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
