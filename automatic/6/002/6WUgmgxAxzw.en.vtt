 kilos almost playfully finished and she 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.700
 is by no means a bargain but it 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.380
 costs another 1000 euro surcharge 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.720
 The travel enduro stops in exemplary fashion

 or beauty flaws the typical

 duckbill of the gs is a matter of taste 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.360
 and creates jobs in accessories 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.280

 euro a significant plus in torque 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 and fantastic sound in the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.420
 curve is the adventure yet 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 fleet-footed than the equally heavy gs 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.370
 the chassis delivers constantly 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.160
 excellent feedback from the 990er v2 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.550
 is elastic smooth running and treat fast 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.940

 tempo loses the austrians 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.459
 the windbreak can be with the 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.970
 the comfortable bmw not quite 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:17.340
 keep up with the same performance 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.040
 weight and yet the ktm is something 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.200
 agile and sparkling than the gsg it 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.300
 is included in the price with enormous 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.430
 ground clearance and larger spring paths 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.570
 is the ktm more suitable for red than the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.570
 Bavarian competitor 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.260
 enormously handy the original suitcase of the 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.390
 gs can be in volume and width 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.460
 Adjust with little luggage builds the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.750
 travel machine thereby significantly narrower 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.490
 as the ktm with accessory suitcases 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.190
 more active the narrow one-piece 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.120
 bench of the ktm comfortable and 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.680
 height adjustable the bmw variable 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.130
 Here is the good anyway 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.380
 windscreen silva at the front mediates 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.780
 the gs less lane contact than the 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.320
 Fully adjustable upside down fork 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.990
 adventure of the finest the white power 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.580
 Federbein rear spring preload is 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.410
 as with the gs per handwheel adjustable 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.910
 the abs of the adventure regulates something 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.750
 coarser than that of the Bavarian 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.570
 competitors 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.160
 the main thing but both have travel enduros 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.160
 the safety feature on board 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:40.629
 The BMW is the perfect allrounder ring 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.819
 absolutely suitable for everyday use and impeccable 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.639
 especially as a tourer in terms of comfort and 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.439
 range for athletic turns has 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.399
 as well as on gravel and sand is the ktm 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.229
 first choice 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.330
 in sum of all properties has the 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.409
 bmw the nose or the duckbill 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.449
 slightly forward 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.490
 between bavaria and austrians is like that 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.180
 a judgment, of course, pure 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.180
 a matter of taste
