from the side of my face that I left out
from<00:01:49.290> earlier<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.850> twist<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.000> back<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
from earlier on twist this back in the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
from earlier on twist this back in the
direction<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.259> curl<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> pin<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> right

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
direction of the curl and pin it right

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.600 
direction of the curl and pin it right
down<00:01:53.970> over<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.689> bun<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> look<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
down over the bun so I like the look of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
down over the bun so I like the look of
having<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> loose<00:01:57.329> ends<00:01:57.659> hanging<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
having the loose ends hanging out but

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.300 
having the loose ends hanging out but
again<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.250> totally<00:01:59.670> optional

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.249 

so<00:02:07.310> twist<00:02:07.729> back<00:02:07.939> all<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.569> loose<00:02:08.750> hair<00:02:08.989> from

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
so twist back all the loose hair from

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.470 
so twist back all the loose hair from
both<00:02:09.560> sides<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.910> should<00:02:11.090> end<00:02:11.269> up<00:02:11.450> with

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
both sides and you should end up with

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.320 
both sides and you should end up with
something<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.989> looks<00:02:12.349> like<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:13.060> feel<00:02:14.060> for

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
something that looks like this feel for

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
something that looks like this feel for
any<00:02:14.540> weird<00:02:14.930> ends<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.410> are<00:02:15.440> poking<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:16.040> or

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
any weird ends that are poking out or
