continually gonna grow and there's a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.880 
continually gonna grow and there's a
huge<00:02:13.200> demand

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
huge demand

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
huge demand
huge<00:02:14.190> huge<00:02:14.550> huge<00:02:14.670> demand<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.510> computer

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
huge huge huge demand for computer

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.800 
huge huge huge demand for computer
scientists<00:02:16.319> right<00:02:16.470> now<00:02:16.940> like<00:02:17.940> there's<00:02:18.630> more

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
scientists right now like there's more

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.300 
scientists right now like there's more
demand<00:02:19.020> than<00:02:19.290> there<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.470> supply<00:02:19.590> especially

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
demand than there is supply especially

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.440 
demand than there is supply especially
for<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.340> middle<00:02:23.610> level<00:02:23.850> like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
for the like middle level like

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.900 
for the like middle level like
experienced<00:02:25.410> senior<00:02:25.709> level<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.700> five<00:02:26.880> years

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
experienced senior level like five years

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.120 
experienced senior level like five years
plus<00:02:27.300> there's<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.020> strong<00:02:28.530> lack<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:31.130> computer

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
plus there's a strong lack of computer

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.130 
plus there's a strong lack of computer
science<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:34.140> people<00:02:34.830> with<00:02:34.920> experience<00:02:36.140> so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
science to people with experience so

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.170 
science to people with experience so
that<00:02:37.290> creates<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> lot<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.010> opportunity<00:02:38.610> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that creates a lot of opportunity for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.220 
that creates a lot of opportunity for
those<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.390> are<00:02:39.750> interested<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.290> field

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
those that are interested in that field

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.380 
those that are interested in that field
another<00:02:43.230> great<00:02:43.530> benefit<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:45.239> only

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
another great benefit is that it only

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.510 
another great benefit is that it only
takes<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:46.590> only<00:02:46.709> requires<00:02:47.040> an<00:02:47.190> undergraduate

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
takes it only requires an undergraduate

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.759 
takes it only requires an undergraduate
degree<00:02:48.020> great<00:02:49.020> benefit<00:02:49.410> obvious<00:02:49.800> benefit<00:02:50.720> and

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
degree great benefit obvious benefit and

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.460 
degree great benefit obvious benefit and
then<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.040> course<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.959> next<00:02:54.959> after<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
then of course like next after the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.160 
then of course like next after the
general<00:02:55.769> basics<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.519> job<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.780> quality

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
general basics of a job is the quality

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.580 
general basics of a job is the quality
of<00:02:58.200> life<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.600> how<00:03:00.600> fun<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.320> work<00:03:01.440> as<00:03:01.560> a

of life and how fun is it to work as a
computer<00:03:01.890> scientists<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:04.170> fun<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
computer scientists I think how fun it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.810 
computer scientists I think how fun it
is<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:05.340> work<00:03:05.610> as<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> computer<00:03:06.180> scientist<00:03:06.800> or

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
is to work as a computer scientist or

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.009 
is to work as a computer scientist or

computer programmer or a software

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.330 
computer programmer or a software
engineer<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.680> really<00:03:10.920> depends<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
like schedules they like to progress

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.220 
like schedules they like to progress
linearly<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.620> know<00:03:28.709> they<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.870> they

like to know when they're gonna progress

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.740 
like to know when they're gonna progress
like<00:03:32.670> oh<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.820> forget<00:03:33.150> my<00:03:33.209> masters<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.660> are

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
like oh I forget my masters that are

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
like oh I forget my masters that are
gonna<00:03:33.870> pay<00:03:34.049> me<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.290> amount<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.459> work

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
gonna pay me this amount or if I work

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.979 
gonna pay me this amount or if I work
this<00:03:35.880> many<00:03:36.060> years<00:03:36.269> am<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.570> gonna<00:03:36.660> get<00:03:36.870> promoted

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
this many years am I gonna get promoted

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.170 
this many years am I gonna get promoted
then<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.070> if<00:03:38.130> some<00:03:38.459> people<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> lot<00:03:39.090> of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
then so if some people like a lot of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.569 
then so if some people like a lot of
structure<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.739> those<00:03:40.860> kind<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.100> people<00:03:41.190> a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
structure so for those kind of people a

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.610 
structure so for those kind of people a
larger<00:03:42.329> company<00:03:42.510> would<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:43.019> better<00:03:43.230> suited

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
larger company would be better suited

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.550 
larger company would be better suited
for<00:03:43.860> them<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.280> Qualcomm<00:03:44.579> Raytheon<00:03:45.560> stuff

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
for them like Qualcomm Raytheon stuff

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.699 
for them like Qualcomm Raytheon stuff
like<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.890> for<00:03:47.519> people<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> wanna<00:03:48.420> do<00:03:48.720> that

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
to just go with the flow and do

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.110 
to just go with the flow and do
something<00:03:53.160> new<00:03:53.280> every<00:03:53.549> day<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.930> just

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
having work in a more exciting

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.930 
having work in a more exciting
environment<00:03:58.470> those<00:03:59.190> people<00:03:59.519> would<00:03:59.610> do<00:03:59.790> better

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
environment those people would do better

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.690 
environment those people would do better
in<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.209> smaller<00:04:00.480> company<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
in a smaller company like like it for a

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.569 
in a smaller company like like it for a
company<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:04.040> OkCupid<00:04:05.040> who<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.280> making<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
company that OkCupid who is making a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.640 
company that OkCupid who is making a
dating<00:04:05.850> website<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.810> relatively<00:04:07.350> small

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
dating website that's a relatively small

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.910 
dating website that's a relatively small
company<00:04:07.829> or<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:09.180> tech<00:04:09.630> startup<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.650> something

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
company or a tech startup so something

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.949 
company or a tech startup so something
that's<00:04:10.950> more<00:04:11.340> smaller<00:04:11.910> would<00:04:12.269> see<00:04:12.780> so

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
that's more smaller would see so

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:13.310 
that's more smaller would see so

the great thing about computer science

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.990 
the great thing about computer science
is<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.520> there's<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:44.819> many<00:04:44.879> different

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
get the computer science degree and they

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.740 
get the computer science degree and they
don't<00:05:31.379> I<00:05:31.529> mean<00:05:31.710> they<00:05:31.860> appreciate<00:05:32.520> the

and stuff but being a project manager
for<00:05:41.219> computer<00:05:41.610> science<00:05:41.969> or<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.150> software

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
for computer science or a software

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.200 
for computer science or a software
company<00:05:42.779> or<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.199> tech<00:05:43.830> company<00:05:43.979> it<00:05:44.789> would<00:05:44.969> still

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
company or a tech company it would still

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.089 
company or a tech company it would still
be<00:05:45.330> better<00:05:45.449> to<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:46.379> computer<00:05:46.949> science

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
be better to have a computer science

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.279 
be better to have a computer science
degree<00:05:47.310> than<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> business<00:05:48.779> degree<00:05:48.930> or

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
degree than a business degree or

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.490 
degree than a business degree or
something<00:05:49.500> else<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.520> think<00:05:51.259> just<00:05:52.259> because<00:05:52.349> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
something else so I think just because a

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.140 
something else so I think just because a
person<00:05:52.979> gets<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.339> computer<00:05:53.639> science<00:05:53.909> degree

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
person gets a computer science degree

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.670 
person gets a computer science degree
that<00:05:54.360> doesn't<00:05:54.629> mean<00:05:54.750> yeah<00:05:55.020> just<00:05:55.080> has<00:05:55.379> to<00:05:55.529> sit

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
that doesn't mean yeah just has to sit

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.260 
that doesn't mean yeah just has to sit
down<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:55.949> program<00:05:56.279> all<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.520> time<00:05:56.610> he<00:05:57.240> can

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
down and program all the time he can

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.209 
down and program all the time he can
work<00:05:57.509> in<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:58.199> know<00:05:58.259> project<00:05:58.680> management<00:05:59.129> or

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
work in you know project management or

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.309 
work in you know project management or
working<00:05:59.550> with<00:05:59.669> customers<00:06:00.080> clients<00:06:01.080> he<00:06:01.199> could

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
working with customers clients he could

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.430 
working with customers clients he could
also<00:06:01.469> do<00:06:01.680> Rock<00:06:01.949> marketing<00:06:02.490> like<00:06:02.759> it<00:06:03.599> just<00:06:03.810> it

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
also do Rock marketing like it just it

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.260 
also do Rock marketing like it just it
but<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:04.889> does<00:06:05.009> done<00:06:05.250> from<00:06:05.490> getting<00:06:05.789> a<00:06:05.819> computer

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
but it does done from getting a computer

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.640 
but it does done from getting a computer
science<00:06:06.690> degree<00:06:07.039> so<00:06:08.750> yeah<00:06:09.750> kind<00:06:10.199> of<00:06:10.259> rambled

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
science degree so yeah kind of rambled

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.100 
science degree so yeah kind of rambled
but<00:06:11.339> getting<00:06:12.180> computer<00:06:12.479> science<00:06:12.690> degree<00:06:12.930> is

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
but getting computer science degree is

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.800 
but getting computer science degree is
really<00:06:13.500> smart<00:06:13.800> right<00:06:13.949> now<00:06:14.009> I<00:06:14.479> think<00:06:15.479> it's<00:06:15.719> a
