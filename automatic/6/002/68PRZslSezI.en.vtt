00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.299

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.930
 transferlist okay david luiz that would be 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.510
 but what was worth was there I have to go 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.920
 watching as it is for now is also 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.299
 you can never do bad at all 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.579
 on the transfer list what else trade 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.180
 here 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.310

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:32.180

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:34.459
 three k worth bruno rodriguez okay so 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.950
 you have to say it's a good pack 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.370
 is actually a really good pack 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 we had a lot there 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.080
 Unfortunately 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.770
 no team of the season 8 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.340
 and I wonder when or where sold 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.170
 very nice 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.090
 when was this rest of the year please ? 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.600
 world was only for one day 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.080
 or for the weekend or so long 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.400
 weekend because that's really a pity me 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.770
 have no chance to pull them 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:13.370
 I just pulled left like you 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.780
 know the good active exactly there came only 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.280
 Let's see what you can do with it 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.660
 this is my current team 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.370
 very nice chamber play 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.320
 I'll think about it again maybe 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.190
 make a game but four minutes I 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.350
 believe in here 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.360
 I think I 'm just zock so first 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.860
 had been a train with the team is 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.400
 namely not wrong here philipp 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.790
 lame me just like gündogan so the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.960
 both are very good then here he sat 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.610
 think about me and maybe otherwise 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.410
 someone else could put in 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.710
 I do not know how to get there, eg 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.160
 packed out will also reinpasst therefore 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.160
 for example 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.449
 actually only fits there 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.710
 Bundesliga players come in only briefly 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:01.009
 watch what else we would have there 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.009
 positions z 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.910
 bundesliga wildmoser let's see what's there 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.259
 well of course there are gods 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.789
 but that was right middle field then 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:17.580
 or so I think toni of course 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.960
 crooked down there or like the tan 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.060
 I think it's really good 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:37.620
 top is draxler it really big to me 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:41.820
 slowly I have the yes I think yes it 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.120
 there are still so Fermino diego when he 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.830
 was still at wolfsburg 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.380
 but I think otherwise waxes 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.880
 and so cms of course I can somehow 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:01.340
 make a striker back there 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.340
 lewandowski properly packs mandzukic 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.229
 Naturally renounce why was 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.870
 Mandzukic I have the ag already 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:15.570
 Mandzukic own things bought I do 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:22.110
 it does not mandzukic with rock and 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:32.060
 then him with s &amp; t after a sms to zdm 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:34.639
 do you think I have to go 99 180 believe 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.389
 I have, I may want you so 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.610
 communication problem with ultimate team 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:44.330
 Also what I think I still have 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:47.760
 not exactly here is the agüero eto'o 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.500
 I have the normal players 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.880
 exchange so could think so 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:07:00.660
 you theoretically try king 4 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:05.700
 mertesacker pop bar as the question makes 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.760
 they are staggered in c30 has not 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.760
 just 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.040
 Oh, I can think it over again 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.660
 in any case I will soon bring me 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.330
 Maybe not me at all 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.010
 wrong city is even lewandowski 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.590
 City namely really good bums up there 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.150
 not really good in the head and head 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.550
 then the team is really strong 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.260
 Alright I say first many 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.640
 thanks for turning me on 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.740
 Hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.900
 up there maybe a comment 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.220
 and the others see us in the 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.220
 next episode again does so well
