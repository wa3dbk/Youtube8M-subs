 Hello everyone, I'm Franco Ballerini, technical manager of the national team 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.790
 cycling 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.710
 I was a professional from '86 to 2001, opening up in this situation 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 I won 2 Paris tubes 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.170

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:18.980
 Olympia 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 in the experience of the technical athlete I have always considered recovery a phase 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.789
 important as a good training and always know 2 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.079

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.020
 cards 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.690
 when I ran there were three linden trees of other teams that they have 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.360
 sponsored by other broadcasters however they bought this because 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 it was an extremely effective product 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.860
 however this was excellent for the recovery of the great competitions and elements of 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.140
 long duration 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.520

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560
 1 + 1 2 hours 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.630
 however at one problem of catabolism mixed up and this was 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 the input he gave me that made me 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.680
 thinking about the letitbit request to find I am optimizing a product 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 because it can also be used by athletes in the mind of short 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.950
 duration 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.450

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.870
