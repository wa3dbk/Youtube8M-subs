00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just pulls out of the corner when it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.390 
just pulls out of the corner when it
slides<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.899> can't<00:02:10.200> hardly<00:02:10.800> even<00:02:10.979> tell

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
slides in you can't hardly even tell

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.979 
slides in you can't hardly even tell
that<00:02:12.380> there<00:02:13.380> was

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.080 

it's<00:02:16.530> even<00:02:16.890> attached<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.489> in<00:02:17.609> there<00:02:17.819> just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
it's even attached to in there just

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.759 
it's even attached to in there just
slides<00:02:18.569> right<00:02:18.780> into<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.170> corner<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
slides right into the corner so you

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.429
