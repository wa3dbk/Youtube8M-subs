00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:19.220
 This time we will do with setting up a new transmitter . 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.220
 Please take a look at the back of the transmitter first 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.970

 Click on this to configure 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:36.020
 Let's see here the preparation of the Shinkin, the new calibration chaos , and let's go through three moths 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.600
 To go 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.050

 Model fish without anything 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:57.480
 Please use a transmitter this time jr pc man f 2 but 2.4 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.130
 Because it is not a ghz model , there is a change of modulation of pcm ppm 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 I will 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.300

 And so normal mixing and idle up etc. All set this in the unlocked state 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.259
 In it will proceed to the next 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:32.360
 Bing to configure this transmitter

 Switch fraps with neutrality is also true 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:51.710
 Please For but all man there you like this for in the the middle 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:58.980
 This of post-flight mode switch in is anywhere that the tofu to not in flight mode 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:02.990
 It does not matter, but please keep in the flight mode switch is all normal position 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.990
 In Well here click the following 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.040
 in terms of a flight mode it was also confirmed all 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.970
 The next time I remember the position of the center , I 'm sure the center will leave x1 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.970
 Please give me 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.640
 Next click on the glory in motion with the stick in motion range 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.710
 I will remember this in Enix 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.190

 With the left and right stick cocoa, only the left and right sticks are fine 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.150
 Move it all 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.530
 here are channel Nemashi 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.090
 Yappa It is Weber of the other and to this Haq chan Nene is if 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.800
 There is no pc x and I paste it all with this channel I recognize that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.660
 Switch to the storage for the channel 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.080
 Please try to touch 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 Now click on next 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.769
 Plan control When calibration is done correctly 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.700
 Place it smoothly against the plane to listen to each burn water here forehead 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.310
 I will 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.340
 First throttle 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.530
 Channel name will react in case of jr 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:44.780
 Continued 6 channels I remember here too, but this is the pitch helicopter pitch 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.780
 Recording with Control 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.360
 Next is the aileron operation and then the second one responds 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.420
 Both smoothly 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.620
 The bar will be new in proportion to the amount of ticks 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.000
 Next elevator This and Thunder will go like this smoothly 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.210
 The fourth is a wolf 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 Because in Te No. 5 in high spirits included there is only a thin Chong face 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:11.280
 It's gonna disappear or disappear 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 Enoch channel name is pitch so fluff switch 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.360
 There is neutrality, but there is also one person in the middle . 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.410
 In on or off this way and not in the middle position before this calibration 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.100
 It is a child channel like this, so if you have the middle, be sure to make it a munder 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.340
 Since 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.480
 Carry me, I'm going to smooth the lever of the jersey I'm also so smooth 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.360
 Yes I do not have any problem in English so click Finish 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.719
 After the completion of 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.620
 At this time , I remember what kind of signal to transmit on what kind of new channel. 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:47.789
 I will let you click next 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.040

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.750
 here 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.930
 Double click 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.980
 Then each model of jr comes out 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.140
 so 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.969
 The most close not it is an article two box 2 is not because what x This is the closest the Knicks 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.470
 Click Next 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.330

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.320
 This is all 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.930
 Will end 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.950
 I'm sure it's a plane and I'm going to be in the air 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.270
 Wet bait 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.260
 want Tsuiteiki guarder these were I in grappling with whether -3 songs it is that fired 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.640
 Since this will switch reaction here if 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.640
 I think I can confirm 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.689
 It was over without problems
