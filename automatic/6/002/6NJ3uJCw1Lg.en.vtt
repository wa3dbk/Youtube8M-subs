00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
are basically exterminated from the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.410 
are basically exterminated from the
galaxy<00:04:36.750> they<00:04:37.750> live<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.200> in<00:04:38.880> different<00:04:39.880> forms

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
galaxy they live on in different forms

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.690 
galaxy they live on in different forms
through<00:04:40.900> some<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.440> other<00:04:41.470> races<00:04:42.130> on<00:04:42.670> a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
through some of the other races on a

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.940 
through some of the other races on a
pole<00:04:43.000> they're<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.810> race<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.350> Society<00:04:44.800> are

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
pole they're the race and Society are

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.780 
pole they're the race and Society are
just<00:04:45.160> cleaned<00:04:45.580> all<00:04:45.790> about<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:47.110> with<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:48.010> the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
just cleaned all about so with that the

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
just cleaned all about so with that the
entire<00:04:49.620> Galactic<00:04:50.620> Empire<00:04:51.040> just<00:04:51.220> falls<00:04:51.520> apart

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
entire Galactic Empire just falls apart

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.410 
entire Galactic Empire just falls apart
and<00:04:52.810> all<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.470> species<00:04:53.740> are<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.460> their

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
and all the species are just their

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.190 
and all the species are just their
economies<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.260> fleets<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:58.050> society<00:04:59.050> are

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
economies and fleets and society are

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.010 
economies and fleets and society are
trying<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.560> sunder<00:04:59.920> and<00:04:59.950> so<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.840> there's

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
trying to sunder and so so there's

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.620 
trying to sunder and so so there's
basically<00:05:02.560> it's<00:05:02.860> kind<00:05:03.700> of<00:05:03.820> becomes<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.210> Wild

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
basically it's kind of becomes a Wild

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.890 
basically it's kind of becomes a Wild
West<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.640> game<00:05:06.820> takes<00:05:06.850> place<00:05:07.450> when

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
West and and the game takes place when

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.750 
West and and the game takes place when
these<00:05:08.320> races<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.980> regathered<00:05:09.610> their

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
these races that regathered their

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
quite a bit and all the races are

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.620 
quite a bit and all the races are
completely<00:05:45.130> different<00:05:45.550> I'll<00:05:45.700> do<00:05:45.910> be<00:05:46.270> doing<00:05:46.540> a

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
completely different I'll do be doing a

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.500 
completely different I'll do be doing a
video<00:05:46.780> on<00:05:46.960> each<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.770> them<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.510> demonstrate

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
video on each of them to demonstrate

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.020 
video on each of them to demonstrate
what<00:05:50.410> their<00:05:50.680> special<00:05:51.280> technologies<00:05:51.850> are

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
what their special technologies are

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.270 
what their special technologies are
starting<00:05:52.780> planets<00:05:53.410> that<00:05:53.770> are<00:05:53.830> starting

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
starting planets that are starting

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.320 
starting planets that are starting
fleets<00:05:55.080> hey<00:05:56.080> they're<00:05:56.729> special<00:05:57.729> technologies

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
fleets hey they're special technologies

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.050 
fleets hey they're special technologies
and<00:05:58.660> so<00:05:58.810> forth<00:05:59.110> so<00:06:00.010> with<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.310> let's<00:06:00.850> get

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
and so forth so with that let's get

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.530 
and so forth so with that let's get
started<00:06:01.479> on<00:06:01.660> the
