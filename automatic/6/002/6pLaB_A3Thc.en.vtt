00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello guys from an america and this is the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.980
 my first video 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.599
 technically it is not the first since 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.250
 introduction czech however this the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.500
 first video where he really talks about books 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.089
 so you can consider the first one after 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 this introduction I could also 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.840
 avoid let's move on to the topic of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.029
 today that is one of my favorite actors 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.680
 or john green 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.990
 you already knew this because you read the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 however, title is clearly however agv 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.130
 lupa lei jang rim and that is one of mine 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 favorite contemporary authors and that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.809
 lately it is depopulating throughout 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 italy because they made the film of one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.149
 of his books so all they are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 slingshot in the bookstore and have pulled up 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 the first pile of pages that they are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.170
 all find just to see some 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.329
 who was this john green john green 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.590
 American author who wrote a 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.969
 quite large number of books for 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 counting how many years he started 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 write and unfortunately do not exist 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.420
 just blame the stars and looking 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.369
 alaska that are his most novels 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 famous but there are others more 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.130
 this is what I wanted to talk about today therefore 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 let's just start procrastinating of course 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 there is the most famous novel already the ndrine 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.259
 that of fontina var sars and that is fault 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.750
 stars to those who have not read 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 I don't know where you were because the movie 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 will be released in September are not reading 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.490
 dogs pigs the girls go around 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 saying it's ok ok ok at least 50 times 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 in a sentence e 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 in short, there are also people who maybe 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 start smoking to pretend it is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 a metaphor, however, why not 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 knew a little synopsis in this 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.600
 book could speak a story 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 love of two cancer patients and grace 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.470
 and augusto waters is a star and a lot 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 very, very passionate fun too 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.040
 really ironic sentimental 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.330
 cute with an ending that will leave you 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 it is also psychologically destroyed 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 in short, it is a book 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 really very nice that ever 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.990
 loved it so read it first 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 that the film comes out because September 4th 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 will be in all Italian cinemas 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.900
 the other books I want to talk about john 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.190
 green and looking for alaska routine falasca 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.050
 the first novel that zhang riina has 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.910
 never published this is the story of a 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.519
 boy who goes moves another 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.489
 school where he will live right in 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.890
 campus and meet various characters between 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.780
 which a certain colonel a boy 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.680
 asian and this girl who calls herself 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.900
 alaska looking for alaska alaska is type f 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.180
 of beautiful skins with eyes 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.310
 blue 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 in short, the kind of girl you are 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.269
 explained will not emerge however 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.180
 however this book is very tel 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.750
 It is my taste for merit to be honest 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.459
 however the story in is really touching 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.709
 self so if you want to put yourself down and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.970
 read something a little more serious 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.940
 that however some flashes 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.769
 take this fun now 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.200
 let's go into john green books that don't 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.570
 he knows no one and probably not 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.450
 many Italians have read and begin 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.250
 with one who honestly is not me 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.440
 particularly liked is not among the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.070
 my favorites however is a society freedom 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.450
 of paper this is the story of this 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.030

 levitte also another author of 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.450
 contemporary in practice they have 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.700
 decided to write the book in two 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.150
 do there is a chapter a chapter 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.910
 other 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.769
 zhang lin took uil grayson and david 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.880
 avoid taken another resumed because i 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.130
 characters the two main characters 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.600
 they are both called the griso in 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.300
 this book we see their lives that yes 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.340
 intertwine intertwine let's see how it is 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.110
 They intertwine and influence have one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.660
 on the other one of the uil grayson that is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.960
 what is written by john green and uil 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.150
 grayson who has a group of friends who do it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.669
 consider as good that what 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 in short, it is always a little bit like a wheel 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.660
 escort at some point breaks the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.000
 balls dictates how it should be said and reacts a 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.770
 but instead the wil drizzle of david 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.270
 levithan is a very tormented boy 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.760
 who does not have many friends but in al 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.990
 just that you count on the invitation of 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.410
 wash it and very tormented desperate 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.970
 depressed and therefore it is also nice to see 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.590
 how these interface as yes 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.470
 they interchange these characters one 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.450
 with the other then if you want a book 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.630
 that maybe you even talk about once in a while 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.090
 homosexual story that has strokes of 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.430
 scene that is fun even a little 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.310
 fragile as a book 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.650
 read this is one of my beautiful 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.750
 personal favorites and the band 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.580
 tris in Italian catherine theorem 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.010
 who talks about a co lead singer 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.570
 prodigy that has been dumped for 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.419
 nineteenth time the girl who is 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.350
 call catherine he has a landline for the 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.910
 stones 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.020
 let's understand why obviously 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.210
 very sexy honor 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.830
 however the fact is that every part for 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.650
 this road trip does not travel in 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.750
 car with her best friend sun 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.810
 and arrives in a certain gutshot which is one 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.360
 city in america not solum and i don't know if 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.699
 exists if there is much beauty put a 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.169
 clyde has chosen however it is a book 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.320
 really very interesting flippers 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.509
 anticipate because this is days here 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.300
 pitted between one page and another 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.120
 notions type phrases quotes in Greek 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.949
 small words in German anyway 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.330
 so much interesting information than me 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.669
 personally on a person here 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.770
 so much anecdotes so if 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.330
 you like anecdotes and you like a 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.370
 book that is intelligent and 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.620
 interesting where the romance doesn't 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.810
 be right in the center of attention 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.490
 this book is for you and the last one 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.770
 I want to talk about is a book that 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.810
 unpublished in Italy and is called live is no 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.580
 by john green and another two or three laps yes 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.550
 they call maureen jones and the king miracle 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.919
 this book is practically gods 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.810
 stories of novels written in 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.550
 English because born in Italy offers 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.080
 yet released I have not yet read which 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.330
 us or what you talk about, but I know I am 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.860
 short stories set at Christmas John 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.020
 green has done this project with others 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.280
 two actresses then actresses erika authors 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.539
 come back yesterday what you talk about but he has me 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.970
 said he is very nice and I still have to 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.440
 read it they dragged up to the how 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.210
 by Christmas I dragged it until summer 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.150
 I don't think it is the case to read 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.990
 a winter book also because it can 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.289
 however, the weather recommends a little though 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.300
 we'll see 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.150
 this was my lens I am a little bit 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.650
 my vision of john grillo finds a 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.099
 fantastic author for those who write books 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.110
 really beautiful so if you want a 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.210
 author who makes you laugh at them 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.770
 make you cry a little 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.270
 of the vine that truly understands i 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.490
 young because I really feel myself 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.020
 therefore, I mirror a lot in these books 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.060
 you like all of these 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.710
 features already read a green and 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.270
 don't just read the stars' fault 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.909
 by looking at the auction you can also read 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.990
 others because they are beautiful too 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:39.310
 they are also interesting and deserve 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.539
 be illuminated by the bull's eye 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.949
 literary 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:44.949
 see you at the next hello video
