00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.830
 today we look at the next 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.759
 modification for games with pint times it is on 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.779
 your screens are chevrolet c mp-3 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.490
 tons 4 to 4 hag 1.0 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 in my opinion the length of my name yet 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 was not I do not know what it is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.859
 I do not have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.769
 again with glasses the camera problem is not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.420
 turns stands in one place 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.960
 some roundels apparently pedals 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.110
 there is a gear shift lever 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.239
 disgusting pixel textures 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.899
 appearance appearance well what can 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.770
 say about the appearance that is matte 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.559
 texture 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.680
 Perhaps this is due again to the version 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.239
 games gimbal is not spinning there are springs 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 booth done not bad enough 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:11.640
 one can see a bunch of polygons 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.869
 roundness there is no mountain of polygons 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 I hope you will see it all 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.330
 the wings are done well but that's why 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 made cab ribs with so with such 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.509
 polygons I don't know that is here they are on 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 your screens on the mirror are also polygons 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.299
 viewed inside that is here 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 seat trim is very good there 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.579
 some kind of insert 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.409
 metal insert here goes here 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.630
 also 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.250
 polygons well, and then the cabin is all pixel 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.500
 it is now with you looked at it 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 wheels, too, they are without texture but I tell you 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 repeat guys maybe this is because 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.219
 version of the game 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.870
 We look at what you can put on it 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:04.320
 I am in English that is not in Russian 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:10.530
 where did you get that chalk is it with us 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.810
 the onboard platform is his native board here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.090
 done well the rest is all in green 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 tones exactly the same as the cabin 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 well done i have the same texture 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:27.960
 used tank tank too 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.880
 done quite a lot of ribs but 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.580
 again if you do high 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.110
 polygonal model then naturally she 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.260
 will require a very computer 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.450
 many resources 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.730
 here is attached to the screeds tank lies in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.830
 body screed 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:53.630
 secured normally at all so as not to 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:56.400
 flew tentovanny that gives but yes 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.370
 never give you anything 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.930
 actually generally bespontovy so 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.100
 doors open 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.680
 glass to glass door everything opens 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.209
 now now now we can see 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.470
 a little way okay no light bulbs 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.500
 don't burn the rest everything works yes wanted 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.260
 you know what to pay attention 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.299
 Now just noticed the headlights look 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.880
 how are the headlights made at all perfect 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.080
 the texture is the impression that 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.820
 it really 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.519
 headlight I just have not seen such here 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.010
 good such detail lights 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.570
 that is, the glass itself fairings headlights 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.440
 or whatever it is called okay 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.150
 continue on 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:55.060
 u remove you till i die that gives 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.940
 utility gives us repair and fuel gives a 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.610
 Well, yes, here, in principle, lies from the garage 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.840
 parts by and large probably from type 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.910
 repair parts yes yes yes here in the chain 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.700
 you can put but for this we need 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.370
 project forward a little bit so stops 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.580
 tank trailer default look binding 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.470
 airbag as usual that is and 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.700
 so it is clear that 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:28.290
 air bag connect so well 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.150
 the trailer we have is a normal van 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.310
 picks up ok I don't think that 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.950
 this little pit feast can carry 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.330
 such a bodyguard, by the way, along with 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:45.180
 It'll take no go here she is 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.180
 loaded we get and we have wheels 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.940
 they just become a little wider yes 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.820
 really 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.320
 So let's go for a ride, I will not 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.970
 close no door no glass nothing 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.970
 I will also close the salon price 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:05.860
 now a little ride and crows 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.300
 but I don't know how to 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.210
 characterize the transport he 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.210
 Widos him vidos even some miserable 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:30.729
 physics seems to be spelled out by him from KAMAZ 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.830
 KAMAZâ€™s sound is in his game 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.190
 default it replaces something else but I 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:43.720
 replaced kraz I separately registered it as 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:52.419
 suspension time suspension works spring 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:57.630
 we have all the rubber as usual they 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.630
 drawn out very well yes 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:13.430
 screenshot on the thumbnail to be honest 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.690
 it is not clear here I do not understand that is for 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.690
 why you know nothing 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.030
 just shove the game just for this 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.860
 they put it here because they already 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.740
 really my trucks did 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.099
 almost all that are possible 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.099
 here 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.949
 he way of the course terrain very 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.949
 even good 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.749
 we have not included anything but he goes 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.370
 drags that is no problem on 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:49.370
 overdrive we drive 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.770
 water has somehow spilled here 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:02.560
 have we not yet stopped and the water is already 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:07.620
 squirting there let's turn on everything and we 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.620
 Gopnik immediately start great drove 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.530
 but the camera is not in the cockpit she slowly go 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:22.360
 to the bottom well, the damage he receives does not 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:24.449
 insignificant damage I do not understand who 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.039
 he will ride 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.139
