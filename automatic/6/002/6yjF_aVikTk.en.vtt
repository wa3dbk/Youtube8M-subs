 secret that you should not find anyone if

 make a gift that goes in two parts and 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.800
 I'm going to show you how to do them 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.090
 ironman card and it is this gift that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.699
 obviously it 's a grass but it's also 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.320
 lined as ironman so it's left 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.100
 here to see it and do not take off from your 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 monitor 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 the first thing is to cover the box and here I 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.410
 I'm doing what the cast 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.809
 It seems that it is a very good option for 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 this and also if you put any type 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.530
 of decoration you can change it can 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.469
 be very elegant very formal with a 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.500
 very father design and that's what I 'm 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.629
 doing the lining there I go everything is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.370
 being very well in addition to quite 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.219
 male more like I'm giving him a 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 gift rosita and you know and well then 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.640
 you see it's very easy now I'm going to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 put those two bits to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.820
 seal it there 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.530
 and that's it right now I'm going to do some 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.930
 paper recipes I will do the gilthead 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.740
 and red because that is the color of the suit 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.620
 of German 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.460
 then there I am doing one I am going to 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.290
 Put on silicon and it's very easy only 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.440
 I put it together like this and I 'm going to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.330
 bandaid teach how is paper 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.160
 you see that I have here I'm just going 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.360
 to grab my folds board too 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.940
 you can do it with your hands but the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.680
 truth is that I'm not so skilled I could 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.360
 Mark every quarter inch every 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.070
 fourth every quarter and now I'm going to fold 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.570
 fold fold fold and it will come out 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 this one like zig zag 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 I made two one and a half inch strips 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.390
 wide and two other leagues one 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.910
 inch wide so that I will stay 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.190
 these you do know now nothing else what 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.140
 crushed towards the center and I have left 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 the recipes just like that I put the two 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.640
 big on the banks the two girls in 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 half I put those glimpses that figure 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.890
 as the heart of German and I put the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.570
 unique and invincible ironman and he's already very 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.670
 ok this is the first part now the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.950
 second part is a card like this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 It's a squash card 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.190
 I did this five levels but you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.350
 I will teach to do once 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.660
 levels and how important obviously 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.700
 is that he has the face of this character 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.830
 you know how much I really like what 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.050
 first is to count three boxes of 4 x 4 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.120
 inches and then I'm going to double the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.700
 the following way as if it were a 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.240
 asterisk I'm going to do this line and 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 right away a perpendicular and here from the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.210
 same way as a tache in each 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.270
 of the three and now a cross like that and the 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.860
 perpendicular and equal in each of the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.210
 three alone that no longer fear for all the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 process so that the video does not become so 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.650
 long we will double all the lines that already 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.450
 we have marked and if you like 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.860
 very much this character that you know that 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.050
 I'm going to give him a little hand up to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 this video now the two corners 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.800
 take them to the center and you're going to 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.140
 get a picture like this again I'm going to 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.060
 teach how to do it but now in this 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.940
 another paper carries these two corners 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.710
 toward the center 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.750
 if you have any doubt why not 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 I explained well or something like that you can leave a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.850
 comment below and I as soon as 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 that I can I will answer you super good 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.390
 we are very advanced now only 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.210
 let's stick one on another 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.890
 immediately this we are going to put the 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.320
 silicone we are not going to put this other 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.840
 above and in this box equal to this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.360
 silicone and the other in five cut 8 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.760
 squares a little smaller 4 reds and 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.320
 4 golds for decorating the interior all 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.330
 the pictures of the card in measure 2 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.310
 inches but it's not that I have here are 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.290
 one inch and three quarts for one 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.540
 inch and three quarters one I have them 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.490
 complete and others in half for 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.010
 paste them and they are super good and 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.870
 our a free and well you know that 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.520
 It's the secret to always cut a little more 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.100
 little ones so that it looks even done 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.920
 that white shore that look great 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.420
 now we are going to paste the 11 there is only that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.130
 leave the white squares to the center to 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.710
 write and now let's do the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.170
 card covers because this 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.220
 very thick paper box of 2.5 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.170
 2.5 inches and 1 down from 3.5 by 3.5 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.210
 inches is very easy is only 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.660
 cover the cap and I put him feel 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.960
 double-sided I will not be I put that other 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.780
 paper that covers and now we are going to 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.370
 make the german mask is very easy 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.770
 and he is sure that if I can do it 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.600
 You can also do it. I have a 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.220
 golden self-adhesive paper that I got 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.900
 there is no need for it to be 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.240
 autoadherible your paper but if it is 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.150
 It needs to be golden because if it's not 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.970
 golden, it's going to look like weird 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.160
 we start by tracing the leads 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050
 easy enough I really am 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.850
 superman the cartoonist I did not achieve it and 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.310
 I doubt that I also do it that way 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.290
 now we are going to cut it with the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.230
 scissors the small parts with the 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.870
 exact and good is the face of 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.400
 ironman now I'm going to tell you that if 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.080
 you have not subscribed this channel you can 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.170
 do so every time I get on 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.300
 a video youtube tell you and tell you 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.280
 hey you know that memorabilia I just went up 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.830
 a video you can see and be super 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.570
 solid and I also clear following with 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.280
 the card only needs to paste the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.500
 ironman mascarita and super good 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.240
 cut out in one of these squares of 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.730
 cardboard a little bit thicker than we did 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.689
 a while ago we lined up remember 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.369
 those that are there 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.559
 arribita in the upper right corner 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:24.959
 right in the USA I'm breaking record 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:26.789
 I've had quite a good time and I've already 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.429
 teaches to do two projects we are going very 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.799
 well good now only to refine 

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:34.409
 some details in the mask already 

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:37.199
 paste it I should have stuck it or not 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.699
 this way but a little biased but not 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.559
 nothing is going to look good if you do not 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.509
 you can be biased like the one 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.209
 I have next to only see better now 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.919
 hit the cap right away the layer of 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.599
 down with this ribbon that I look for what 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.579
 I'm putting it this way how short 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.559
 now if you put the other cover on top 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.360
 so you do not see where it comes from ready 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.849
 this is a very classic project easy and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.439
 father if you liked it would be very father 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.179
 what will you share in your social networks 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.419
 and finally I have a confession that 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:05.789
 do you if I'm not going to marry the super 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.559
 original ironman but yes with a man 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.019
 that feels hernán and is much more 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:12.329
 wonderful that the one of that yes I am 100% 

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.249
 convinced then good castells this was 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:16.499

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:18.400
 next video I send you a big kiss bye 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:20.500
