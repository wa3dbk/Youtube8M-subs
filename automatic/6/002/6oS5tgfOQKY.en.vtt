in<00:00:00.920> this<00:00:01.920> tutorial<00:00:02.129> I'm<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.639> go<00:00:02.730> over

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this tutorial I'm going to go over

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.720 
in this tutorial I'm going to go over
the<00:00:03.259> information<00:00:04.259> boxes<00:00:05.160> which<00:00:05.310> can<00:00:05.490> be<00:00:05.580> found

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
the information boxes which can be found

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.089 
the information boxes which can be found
on<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.029> bottom<00:00:06.359> right<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.810> VFR<00:00:07.589> sectional

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
on the bottom right of the VFR sectional

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.040 
on the bottom right of the VFR sectional
chart<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> lot<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> extremely

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
chart it's got a lot of extremely

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.650 
chart it's got a lot of extremely
important<00:00:10.920> information<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.700> i'm<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.420> bit

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
important information and i'm a bit

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660 
important information and i'm a bit
curious<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.070> many<00:00:14.130> people<00:00:14.519> actually

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
curious as to how many people actually

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.540 
curious as to how many people actually
take<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> time<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.870> read<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.199> they<00:00:16.320> say<00:00:16.650> so

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
take the time to read what they say so

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.400 
take the time to read what they say so
let's<00:00:17.789> take<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> quick<00:00:18.330> look<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.080> review

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
let's take a quick look in and review

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.540 
let's take a quick look in and review
them<00:00:20.029> if<00:00:21.080> we<00:00:22.080> zoom<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.039> first<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.430> we'll

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
them if we zoom in the first thing we'll

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.420 
them if we zoom in the first thing we'll
see<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.970> says<00:00:24.269> caution<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.099> regard

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
see it says caution in it it's in regard

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960 
see it says caution in it it's in regard
to<00:00:26.640> GPS<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.250> basically<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.609> saying<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to GPS and basically what it's saying is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.440 
to GPS and basically what it's saying is
that<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.240> you're<00:00:30.390> using<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.869> GPS<00:00:31.800> fixed<00:00:32.360> from<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that if you're using a GPS fixed from a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
that if you're using a GPS fixed from a
database<00:00:34.670> you're<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> only

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
database you're not going to be the only

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.220 
database you're not going to be the only
person<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> better<00:00:38.730> have

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
person using it and so you better have

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
person using it and so you better have
an<00:00:40.230> eye<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.710> traffic<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.940> there's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
an eye out for traffic because there's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.069 
an eye out for traffic because there's
going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.660> aircraft

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
going to be a lot of aircraft

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
going to be a lot of aircraft
potentially<00:00:43.860> converging<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.390> GPS
