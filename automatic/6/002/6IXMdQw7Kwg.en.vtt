00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
to it the greatest thing about it i

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.350 
to it the greatest thing about it i
think<00:03:11.420> is<00:03:11.600> how<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.560> works<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.850> track<00:03:14.120> wall

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
think is how it works is the track wall

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.440 
think is how it works is the track wall
now<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.410> are<00:03:15.830> used<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.299> old<00:03:17.299> school

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
now if you are used to old school

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.170 
now if you are used to old school
laptops<00:03:17.980> you'll<00:03:18.980> know<00:03:19.250> sort<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.790> up<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> trap

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
laptops you'll know sort of up a trap

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.570 
laptops you'll know sort of up a trap
all<00:03:20.330> of<00:03:20.510> them<00:03:20.660> also<00:03:21.410> when<00:03:21.680> they're<00:03:22.130> hopeful

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
all of them also when they're hopeful

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.309 
all of them also when they're hopeful
mice<00:03:22.760> now<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.150> may<00:03:23.420> think<00:03:23.450> that's<00:03:23.810> really

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
mice now you may think that's really

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.360 
mice now you may think that's really
ghetto<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.739> they<00:03:24.799> should<00:03:24.920> not<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.100> doing<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
ghetto and they should not be doing that

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.949 
ghetto and they should not be doing that
but<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.090> actually<00:03:26.120> works<00:03:26.600> really<00:03:26.690> well

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
but it actually works really well

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.509 
but it actually works really well
because<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.440> can<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.860> left<00:03:28.130> hand<00:03:28.400> right

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
because you can do a left hand right

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.039
