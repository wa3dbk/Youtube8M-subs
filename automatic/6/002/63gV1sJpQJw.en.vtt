00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hey friends welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.550
 model view and today it's about the degree 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.780
 North, yes, and well, I think so 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.160
 I'm going to die today but more after 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.160
 andrew to the same 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.120
 yes there we are again and again 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.030
 Although today I would like the device 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.540
 Imagine that in a very simple way but also 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 quite useful and quite cool chamber like that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.590
 install if you play along with one 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.059
 On the other hand , you can do a bit with minecraft 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.790
 take it easy 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.830
 because a few useful features and 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.340
 also a cool look because if you 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.140
 it presses then one enters in such a way 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.400
 interface in and here you can 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.870
 choose his grave 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.540
 and then if you die then get 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.860
 you grab this 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.850
 The whole thing has a very much like 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.070
 side effect and although I can always you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.010
 in short, that's my favorite grave here 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.690
 that's just a pillar with mine 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.430
 then you have to head here 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:22.720
 go to z wave and then close 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.720
 so now I will kill myself 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.450
 yes people he has heard the right 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:34.689
 beautiful world and death 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.159
 yes, and now I can do it too 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.829
 directly or via pickaxe because you 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.000
 needs a pickaxe for that , namely 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.960
 I'll tear that grave down there again 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 a short moment and then you get 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.950
 all his stuff is the one you just returned 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.390
 in the lost that 's really really good 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.340
 pretty cool as I think 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.180
 and also very useful there are many 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:10.910
 There are many different graves there 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:12.950
 january short show 468 9 different 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.520
 there are graves but it can be done well 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.260
 between there is once this wood grad 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.670
 by default have for the poor 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.250
 people had then there is the whole 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 variant still as stone as he 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.570
 normal citizens then there is simply the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.860
 The pillar looks very snail 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.330
 then it is always the normal 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.390
 The gravestone looks pretty dark 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.230
 then there is the angel thing i do 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.850
 he also thinks he is very cool 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.709
 also good from a cemetery 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.660
 if you are in my power cemetery 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.800
 so creates a scary one 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.480
 the atmosphere 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.150
 but then there is this 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.420
 tombstones here is another version 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.480
 Old here as the classic 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.580
 tombstone then there is always the knight 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.530
 gravestones will be whole 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.680
 interesting from then but there is the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.959
 mistake there is just we are one 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 pillar with a skeleton on it and then 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.670
 there are my favorite is the basta 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.260
 a role with your own head 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.690
 I think that's really pretty 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 make fun of the people's menu 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.390
 The russian me just on top of it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.890
 Cross goes then you can still 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.030
 Decoration a bit forces 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.030
 then it will happen once 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.890
 were you just like bonan school 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.629
 you can place it on the floor like that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.430
 looks very cool because you can 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.099
 also make his own cemetery 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.099
 and baking should also be pressure 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:59.950
 completely devalued and yes looks completely 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.950
 funny, then there are also 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.909
 the normal cross what a whole 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.250
 stone cross what you can put this way 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.609
 as I said really cool, for example 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.980
 a cemetery or something yes and more 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.900
 does not add the machnig 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.630
 little useful i think it's really cool 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.870
 that you can repeat in things and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.639
 it just looks like the murder if 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.710
 you kind of get into minecraft 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.660
 I want to build a few new ones 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.680
 would like to add things then is the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.060
 Murder really very practical yes the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.020
 sun goes down I have to go again 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.750
 call it quits 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.560
 I have that motivated you to please 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.560
 next time
