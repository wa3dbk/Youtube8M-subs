00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.890
 good is the recipe today we have pizza 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.130
 vegetable 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.610
 and well let's do first to say 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.150
 the ingredients a bit of cheese in 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.800
 this case I have some cheese 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.000
 It can be done natural but good 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.500
 tomÃ¡s de frito 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.510
 and all these peppers ingredients that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.860
 I'm more staff that like cheese 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 goat tomato zucchini onion 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.260
 to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.019
 and I like to throw a little bit of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 pineapple also cost good ham 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:50.460
 whatever you like and see here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 we have what is the mass not only 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 we can see ourselves well as this mass 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.400
 of slope take off a little bit because it's 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 natural and is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.760
 It's natural and that's for a little bit of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.890
 no flour 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.320
 we go like this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.320
 well we do not have a roller now 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.840
 a little bit of flour with this more or 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.270
 less I think you're worth and not scrub 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.909
 to make it easier to handle the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 time to cast ingredients move mold 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.460
 a little the figure we want to do 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.409
 as you can see totally reprehensible and 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 you can make any figure that 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 I do not want to make it round 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.399
 it is easier to stretch a little 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.439
 so that it gives a little more of itself because 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.409
 I personally like the thin dough 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.280
 let's get a little 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.280
 so you see 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.009
 very well a stretched with this brush and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.680
 as I said this one with this motorland or 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.520
 good of tomato better said the marks 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.520
 we miss 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470
 OK 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.350
 and we are painting with the brush the pizza 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.460
 to take advantage of a little more 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.460
 and with that I think it will be enough 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.969
 way 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.900
 it is important to understand the tomato well 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.710
 throughout the pizza because it then not 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
 will be stuck 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.410
 you know if maybe I leave the area without 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 tomato is very dry and time 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.319
 if it is done, it can be stuck and not left 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.290
 it's done well let's go next step 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.280
 the case we do 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.280
 and we throw 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.290
 we take the amount each will 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.290
 like I would say a little more pints 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.780
 I would say that personally extend a 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.360
 little bit like that would be enough after 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.150
 we will throw another layer a little more than 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.990
 work fine 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.530
 that would be enough 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.530
 OK 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.569
 and let's talk flowers 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.490
 little bit 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:37.000
 which is then more good and you'll see 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:42.260
 an authentic pizza ordered at home 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.750
 only healthy and better you know 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.300
 good 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.590
 it's worth more come 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.450
 following 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.700
 come tomatoes 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.940
 a little bit over here 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.440
 another moved here here tonight not 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.000
 It was good 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.000
 that there is 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.420
 and come 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.110
 zucchini 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.780
 by doing that I'm making pizza for 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.850
 two people I have to do some 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.730
 more ingredients on one side and less on 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.860
 another side is worth 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.780
 one person and then the other person I 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.970
 he asked 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.210
 not tackling bands 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.400
 so I think it's ideal like that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.889
 perfect 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.460
 goat cheese 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.460
 the area that you seem me 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 OK 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.330
 take I tell you it's sorry tomato pepper 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.129
 Green Orchard base is not 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.400
 perfect then let's take a shot 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.169
 OK 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.810
 well, what foolishness was not going to be 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.560
 below say sometimes I say every 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.919
 good nonsense that I'm going to the subject that 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.220
 we are seeing 100% vegetable pizza 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.960
 healthy and from the garden above 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.410
 from the return to the end 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.220
 and as a last step we will see how it 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.620
 it really goes 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.340
 we remove the layer of cheese that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.310
 I recommended layers applied after 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.530
 thicker 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.800
 deposit lower mind of all these 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.230
 ingredients and now comes the step 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.210
 to throw the onion over again 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.900
 com over and give them that they could not 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.900
 be below 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:49.629
 it does so it is very well true 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.310
 alright 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.789
 the pineapple forgot me in good talk no 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.789
 nothing happens 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:00.810
 before the passage of the onion but not 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.900
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.920
 every nothing nothing happens then it will melt 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.680
 everything and everything will be 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.620
 melted with cheese is just going to 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.480
 differentiate if it's top-down it does not 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.900
 worry about that and we will lose fear of 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.900
 the camera 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.440
 OK 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.350
 remember this I do it by hands in the 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:30.810
 pizza I do it so that at the time of 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:33.240
 put it in the oven is not understood is not 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.949
 in your sky you do not have to put it together 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.370
 because then at the time of putting it and 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.860
 melt to melt all over the pizza 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.360
 well the pizza like that would add a 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.600
 little bit of oregano and thyme 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.100
 above and would be ready to put at 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.810
 oven about 15 minutes 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.970
 at 210 degrees centigrade 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.480
 but now I like it 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.450
 personally this a little bit of oil 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.030
 Olive is very good and very healthy for 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.980
 all the pizza 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:11.139
 and now it's wearing a touch a little more 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:13.529
 artisanal you will see as I told you 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.519
 a little oregano 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:16.519
 above 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.710
 and take this I have not done it 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.340
 practically nobody but I like it 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:31.820
 much to throw it away because it's a touch of 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.820
 spices that is very good and very healthy 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:41.510
 according to the ingredients worth 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:52.069
 very well then this vegetable pizza and 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.580
 I would be made and ready to put 

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:56.390
 oven 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.580
 we have the look 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.580
 well, the oven 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.520
 you see it and then we'll put it there 

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.520
 210
