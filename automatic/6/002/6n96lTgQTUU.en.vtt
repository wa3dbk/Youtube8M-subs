 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.830
 another video this time a room pd 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.279
 tutorial math times show how you 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.900
 Insert a video into the cafe and the de 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.270
 is actually pretty easy 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.470
 you only need some program with 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.230
 I can create her films, for example 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.600
 Now I can study for that and I have 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.110
 theme are no tests made video 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.610
 Here is a normal video 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.140
 and I'll pull that in now 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:48.220
 camtasia studio in as you like me 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.150
 this in the timeline and there bigger 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.330
 see the picture again and here too 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.330
 once again 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.500
 so 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 that's what happens to me and now we go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.850
 to produce and pass on 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.680
 because here on custom product 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
 so settings 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.710
 and click on next and here is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.659
 important now that we choose here 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.570
 avm and then we click on continue 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.250
 here so it might be lax 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.789
 and this driver automatically stops 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 frame rate automatically and sand here, too 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.330
 continue here the wide and can fill 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.640
 you can not enter 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.110
 we have I let the making them the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.330
 normal standard youtube has the size 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 and then we continue on this 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.920
 further and now we can name 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.950
 I come up with a time sun times pd 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 and then we will finish 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.390
 change that short immediately ready 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.940
 so we finish only the - 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.120
 times and now we have that here the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.790

 with me on the screen here and 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.940
 now 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.460
 material on the screen on now

 For now, let's start now 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.250
 we want to play here now 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.570
 that he now runs this video and 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.080
 we can do it all now 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:13.500
 This is how it looks like here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:15.150
 somehow such a small mistake fantasia 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.590
 I think I study that was a fantasy 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.560
 study so well and yes here he played 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.030
 could then just play the video 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.250
 runs and if you then everything ready 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.890
 You have made one you have 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.480
 Go to the top of the settings 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.800
 output here the size of the video 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.990
 Set I once now that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.590
 youtube at this one you can 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.910
 Setting whether it should be an effigy 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.490
 should be on the video 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.020
 if now synonymous manual you can 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.960
 set of images 0 off picture 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.330
 after I wanted someone from bild 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:03.159
 70 because I have something there at the beginning of 70 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:05.750
 posed after picture 100-150 so and then 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.419
 you have to save in memory 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.180
 ask select and here is whole 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.030
 important that we as either a vw take 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.319
 or quicktime quicktime you have there only 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.629
 when he is on the quicktime player 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:23.449
 has installed but I recommend you 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:25.520
 vw if you did that , go 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.919
 you on that edges symbol and now 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.470
 renders the first time this beautiful part 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:35.620
 long he fast forward and 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.620
 demonstrates again 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.230
 so now that finished here as well 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.350
 and so is done and now you give 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.530
 on the desktop and see here 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:00.250
 these files we can once we open 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.350
 see the video runs now through this so 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.350
 stock still a bit but that 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.560
 is now the video so if you 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.170
 it somehow renders again or something 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.340
 then that's a bit 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.890
 go through stuffy 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:21.970
 we are sure to falter a bit though 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.230
 who still every 100 mb big and that's it 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.120
 actually already with the tutorial 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.370
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.180
 make a thumbs up 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.850
 if he does not thumb his thumb 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.040
 downstairs if you have any questions then 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.150
 she writes a comment and me 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.150
 then try to answer
