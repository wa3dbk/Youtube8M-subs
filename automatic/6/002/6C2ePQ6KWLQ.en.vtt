00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello everybody says seven back everything 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 good beauty 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 In today's video, come and bring it to you. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.480
 the beginning in a small part there of a 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.710
 match on moon map 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.810
 I recorded fast so I could 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.269
 bring you a short video today 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 that the purpose of this video is to ask the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.250
 participation in the decision of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 strategies of which brand we go 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.800
 Launch first which ones you have the most 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.480
 interest 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 I already asked for your help with the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 strategy for you to tell me what 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 You find the day interesting for the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.690
 people are passing 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 Only this time I wanted you to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 help decide the order that I go 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.230
 posting to you that is not yet 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 I 'm already recording the strategies 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 of men black ops two maps 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.420
 clear and back bringing now from 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.340
 January 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.289
 I just wanted to know in what order I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 I'll bring this to you. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.730
 in principle he had thought of bringing 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.710
 order the maps were started 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.589
 briefly by traffic and from there 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 Following the l 6 only in a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.270
 wrote me on twitter if not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 I mistake a request to launch 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 first map orges according to him is what 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 he had more difficulty having 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 played for less time this is obvious the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 last map leave and because it was a map 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.080
 which I least cover with - I presented 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.390
 gameplay actually i do not have any 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 coverage on the map I did not pass 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 no hint no assembly etc. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.450
 it was all I did was play some 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 I did not even start to play. 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 take everything from the map but I could do 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 it would not be a problem, yes, it could. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.450
 this as a first strategy 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.210
 It's obvious to you, but I also thought 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 in the face of the side that does not purchase l 6 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.259
 then suddenly I bring it to the map 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.729
 Time says now serving this guy 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.990
 He played a little less that has a little 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 more difficulty 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.040
 suddenly I can not seem to answer that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 everyone because not everyone has 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.659
 in them and in fact most do not buy 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 If I was not mistaken I'd made a 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.799
 research with you is majority had said 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 the answer that he did not then buy 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
 I ended up getting into doubt and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.039
 suddenly you even prefer an order 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.220
 that you do not see one in a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.720
 teaching model that is not in the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.940
 first released here 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.560
 the opposite of the last one back and etc. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.450
 So I'll do the following for us. 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.110
 It's okay to stay in trouble. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.630
 fair 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.460
 I put there on my fan page one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.250
 zinha poll asking what the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.050
 first map you want the bid 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.790
 I'll just ask the first map is 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.890
 Obviously I'm going to have polls on maps. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.830
 different and I'll get the most voted 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 for the least voted and I will bet on this 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
 Order of course, I'll leave some time there. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.080
 and this may change a bit I will leave 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 a little while 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 the poll rolling there on the fan page 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.980
 leave the link in the description of the fan page 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.480
 of the poll in the case and also avails 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.640
 enjoy the fan page if you have not already 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.310
 I appreciate it, it does not cost anything, it's going to be 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.650
 there is good but that's it you think you 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.510
 have understood the scheme of this 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.030
 What will be the purpose of this poll? 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 video also leaves your vote there I go 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 pick the most voted at least voted and 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.970
 so we already have the order of posting 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.290
 of strategies I will not set date 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.090
 to launch any strategy 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.280
 I'll post as I go 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.860
 able to edit these strategies 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.709
 demand a little more time even until 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.360
 to record in itself but in editing it 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.010
 need a little more affection one 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.239
 A little more careful then I will not 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.170
 Promising dates can be common in 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.970
 hollywood quinho 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.890

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.080
