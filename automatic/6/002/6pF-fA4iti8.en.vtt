00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
going to keep on watching a little bit

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.100 
going to keep on watching a little bit
closer<00:02:21.030> stern<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.270> bit<00:02:22.360> more<00:02:22.450> often<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
wait until we can actually last night I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.480 
wait until we can actually last night I
was<00:02:26.200> Stern<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:26.980> was<00:02:27.070> almost<00:02:27.220> like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
was Stern it up and it was almost like

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.550 
was Stern it up and it was almost like
swirling<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.540> went<00:02:28.750> about<00:02:28.840> 15<00:02:29.380> minutes

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
swirling and I went about 15 minutes

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.280 
swirling and I went about 15 minutes
beyond<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.400> wear<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.660> start<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
beyond that to wear when you start it it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.630 
beyond that to wear when you start it it
would<00:02:32.410> actually<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> hole<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.370> center

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
would actually have a hole in the center

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
would actually have a hole in the center
of<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:34.120> think<00:02:34.570> that's<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.080> jail<00:02:35.530> part

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800

few okay guys been another 15 minutes
and<00:03:12.870> basically<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.860> start<00:03:14.920> stirring<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:17.010> as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
and basically you start stirring this as

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.160 
and basically you start stirring this as
we<00:03:18.190> mix<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:18.690> you'll<00:03:19.690> see<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.930> starts

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
we mix it up you'll see it starts

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.790 
we mix it up you'll see it starts
leading<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> trace<00:03:20.830> trail<00:03:21.160> behind<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:25.800> it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
leading like a trace trail behind it it

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.150 
leading like a trace trail behind it it
just<00:03:26.860> kind<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.220> swirls<00:03:27.580> so<00:03:28.739> it's<00:03:29.739> about<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.070> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
just kind of swirls so it's about to the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.120 
just kind of swirls so it's about to the
jail<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.489> pulley<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.380> I'm<00:03:32.739> just<00:03:32.920> about<00:03:33.070> ready

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
jail and pulley so I'm just about ready

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.210 
jail and pulley so I'm just about ready
to<00:03:33.370> enjoy<00:03:33.850> right<00:03:34.090> now<00:03:34.239> plus<00:03:34.950> that's<00:03:35.950> when<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
to enjoy right now plus that's when I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800 
to enjoy right now plus that's when I
take<00:03:36.489> out<00:03:36.730> when<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.120> set<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.420> down<00:03:37.510> for<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> couple

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
take out when I set it down for a couple

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.870 
take out when I set it down for a couple
minutes<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:39.010> actually<00:03:39.280> go<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.430> wipe<00:03:39.610> it<00:03:39.760> off

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
minutes you actually go to wipe it off

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.150 
minutes you actually go to wipe it off
and<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.450> almost<00:03:40.660> starting<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.050> attack<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:41.860> I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
and it's almost starting to attack so I

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
and it's almost starting to attack so I
think<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.959> should<00:03:44.200> be<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.380> point<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.459> first

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
think this should be a point I first

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.020 
think this should be a point I first
started<00:03:46.450> this<00:03:46.630> at<00:03:47.730> 357<00:03:48.870> 347<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.200> now<00:03:50.590> it's<00:03:51.030> 434

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
started this at 357 347 and now it's 434

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.610
