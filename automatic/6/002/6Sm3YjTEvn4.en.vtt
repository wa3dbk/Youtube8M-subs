00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.440 
preferable because it's a little bit
softer<00:02:16.990> top<00:02:17.470> na<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.430> give<00:02:18.610> you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
softer top na it can give you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.949 
softer top na it can give you
