everything but they got to build that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
everything but they got to build that
trust<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:25.990> they<00:02:26.080> could<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.440> because

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
trust and they could do that because

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.050 
trust and they could do that because
they're<00:02:26.770> good<00:02:26.920> enough<00:02:27.010> individually<00:02:27.760> when

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
they're good enough individually when
