be<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:34.489> prescription<00:00:35.489> glasses<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
be about prescription glasses and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
be about prescription glasses and
sunglasses<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> talk<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.460> both

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
sunglasses and I want to talk about both

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
sunglasses and I want to talk about both
in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.600> video<00:00:39.870> because<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> feel<00:00:40.680> like

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
in the same video because I feel like

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.069 
in the same video because I feel like
their<00:00:41.340> historical<00:00:41.969> development<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.809> been

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
their historical development has been

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
their historical development has been
very<00:00:43.460> parallel

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
very parallel

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
very parallel
I'm<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> idea<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> wearing<00:00:46.320> frames<00:00:46.770> on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I'm just the idea of wearing frames on

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.799 
I'm just the idea of wearing frames on
your<00:00:47.309> face<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.820> either<00:00:48.000> protect<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.660> eyes

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
your face to either protect your eyes

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.770 
your face to either protect your eyes
from<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> Sun<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.800> improve<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.219> vision<00:00:50.879> took

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
from the Sun or improve your vision took

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010 
from the Sun or improve your vision took
a<00:00:51.870> while<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> develop<00:00:52.739> let's<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.390> way<00:00:54.420> back

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a while to develop let's go way way back

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.279 
a while to develop let's go way way back
in<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:56.879> prescription<00:00:57.420> lenses

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
in time the first prescription lenses

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.670 
in time the first prescription lenses
were<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.969> mentioned<00:01:00.539> by<00:01:00.989> Emperor

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
were first actually mentioned by Emperor

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.310 
were first actually mentioned by Emperor
Nero's<00:01:02.250> tutor<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.719> around<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> 1st

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
Nero's tutor this was around the 1st

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670 
Nero's tutor this was around the 1st
century<00:01:04.589> AD<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.729> seriously<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.450> long<00:01:07.020> time<00:01:07.439> ago

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
century AD so seriously a long time ago

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
century AD so seriously a long time ago
the<00:01:07.860> Emperor<00:01:07.979> Nero's<00:01:08.490> tutor<00:01:08.850> literally<00:01:09.510> wrote

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the Emperor Nero's tutor literally wrote

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
the Emperor Nero's tutor literally wrote
that<00:01:10.290> small<00:01:10.740> letters<00:01:11.189> could<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.729> seen<00:01:12.090> by

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that small letters could be seen by

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
that small letters could be seen by
looking<00:01:13.020> through<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> glass<00:01:13.770> filled<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
looking through a glass filled with

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
looking through a glass filled with
water<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.750> suggests<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.320> us<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
water so that suggests to us that the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.249 
water so that suggests to us that the
earliest<00:01:17.280> prescription<00:01:18.030> lens<00:01:18.330> single<00:01:19.049> lens

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
earliest prescription lens single lens

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
earliest prescription lens single lens
was<00:01:19.890> actually<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> glass<00:01:20.610> filled<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:20.970> water

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
was actually a glass filled with water

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.429 
was actually a glass filled with water
and<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.689> figured<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and that they figured out that that

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.340 
and that they figured out that that
essentially<00:01:23.220> has<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> distortive<00:01:24.390> effect<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
essentially has a distortive effect that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
essentially has a distortive effect that
allows<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.490> closer<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.210> small

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
allows you to see things closer up small

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020 
allows you to see things closer up small
things<00:01:27.570> closer<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
things closer up which is really kind of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
things closer up which is really kind of
neat<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> historically

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
neat that we have that historically

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100 
neat that we have that historically
recorded<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.850> our<00:01:33.090> second<00:01:33.600> fact<00:01:33.840> which

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
recorded for our second fact which

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
recorded for our second fact which
relates<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> development<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.880> actual

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
relates to the development of an actual

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.050 
relates to the development of an actual
lens<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.590> kicker<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.579> actually

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
lens the kicker is that it actually

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
lens the kicker is that it actually
relates<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> same<00:01:40.020> person<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:40.829> first

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
relates to the same person so our first

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.490 
relates to the same person so our first
fact<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.790> Emperor<00:01:42.119> Nero's<00:01:42.479> tutor<00:01:42.899> for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
fact was about Emperor Nero's tutor for

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.950 
fact was about Emperor Nero's tutor for
a<00:01:43.560> second<00:01:44.040> fact<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.060> emperor<00:01:45.630> Nero

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a second fact it's actually emperor Nero

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.370 
a second fact it's actually emperor Nero
himself<00:01:46.530> who<00:01:47.520> apparently<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.479> recorded<00:01:49.200> as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
himself who apparently is recorded as

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.850 
himself who apparently is recorded as
having<00:01:49.610> enjoyed<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.240> watch<00:01:51.860> gladiatorial

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
having enjoyed to watch gladiatorial

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.389 
having enjoyed to watch gladiatorial
games<00:01:53.390> through<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.689> carved<00:01:55.320> emerald<00:01:55.920> which<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
games through a carved emerald which is

Sun<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.160> incredibly<00:02:37.820> bright<00:02:38.120> so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930

there's<00:02:39.290> two<00:02:39.530> conflicting<00:02:40.190> ideas<00:02:40.730> they're

going<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.620> likely<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.130> actually

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
going on but it's likely that actually

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.150 
going on but it's likely that actually
they<00:02:44.030> may<00:02:44.240> both<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.810> been<00:02:44.959> true<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.040> the

they may both have been true so the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
wise and more scholarly because at that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.820 
wise and more scholarly because at that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
because by then they were widely

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.750 
because by then they were widely
available<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.410> they<00:03:42.530> were<00:03:42.590> mostly<00:03:43.100> worn<00:03:43.519> by

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
those two developments it wasn't really

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.190 
those two developments it wasn't really
until<00:05:21.950> a<00:05:22.220> little<00:05:22.370> bit<00:05:22.520> later<00:05:22.640> that<00:05:23.510> sunglasses
