 Y 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.030
 Thank you 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 well well a very good war coming out 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 the seventh was hard to win but I've 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.750
 made a very good output placed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 right away third then curve 2 can 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.230
 throwing the gastro and out puts me 2 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 seconds and at the end of the echo an error 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.730
 and it makes you free and you get ahead so 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 very good, not good, it's a pity 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.080
 tomorrow I can not have done the pole 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.760
 position but but good this afternoon the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.860
 race has confirmed our 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.860
 speed and I'm happy about that
