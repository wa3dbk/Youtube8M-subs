gonna be finding this cool glitch under

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.330 
gonna be finding this cool glitch under
the<00:00:21.150> map<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the map and it's kind of like a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.830 
the map and it's kind of like a
checkerboard<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.630> apparently<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
checkerboard it's apparently it's like a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.900 
checkerboard it's apparently it's like a
untextured<00:00:28.130> spot<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.550> sure<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
untextured spot I'm not sure what that

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.959 
untextured spot I'm not sure what that
is<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.949> basically<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.730> follow

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
is but basically you want to follow

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.209 
is but basically you want to follow
where<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> ramp<00:00:35.070> off

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
where I go you don't have the ramp off

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.910 
where I go you don't have the ramp off
this<00:00:35.430> giant<00:00:35.969> rock<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> like

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910 
this giant rock that's just what I like
to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.110> over<00:00:40.680> to

to do and you want to make it over to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.150 
to do and you want to make it over to
the<00:00:41.160> racetrack<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.500> haven't<00:00:43.770> completed<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the racetrack if you haven't completed a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
kind of I'm off the racetrack and so you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
kind of I'm off the racetrack and so you
make<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.399> around

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.810 

all<00:01:09.290> right<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:09.680> on<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:09.950> right<00:01:10.130> here<00:01:10.340> you're

you<00:01:15.680> want<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.920> ramp<00:01:16.220> up<00:01:16.520> basically<00:01:17.060> you're

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
you want to ramp up basically you're

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
boost and ramp off it takes me a couple

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.850 
boost and ramp off it takes me a couple
tries<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.220> cut<00:01:22.490> out<00:01:22.520> all<00:01:22.850> my<00:01:23.000> fails<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:24.380> he'll

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
tries so I cut out all my fails so he'll

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.340 
tries so I cut out all my fails so he'll
you'll<00:01:25.040> see<00:01:25.280> where<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:25.850> actually<00:01:26.090> make<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.690> you

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you'll see where I actually make it you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.390 
you'll see where I actually make it you
want<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:27.619> kind<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.979> hit<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
want to just kind of hit it in the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.830 
want to just kind of hit it in the
middle<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.790> you'll<00:01:28.880> eventually<00:01:29.060> get<00:01:29.479> lucky

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
middle and you'll eventually get lucky

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.170 
middle and you'll eventually get lucky
and<00:01:29.960> get<00:01:30.110> launched<00:01:30.470> right<00:01:30.680> there<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.030> now

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and get launched right there and so now

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.320 
and get launched right there and so now
you<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.600> out<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.869> your<00:01:32.930> car<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.440> then<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.150> run

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
you get out of your car and then you run

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.120 
you get out of your car and then you run
it<00:01:35.450> right<00:01:35.570> up<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:35.990> you're<00:01:36.350> out<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> map

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
it right up here you're out of the map

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.760 
it right up here you're out of the map
at<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.460> point<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.840> everything's<00:01:39.530> kind

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
at this point and so everything's kind

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.040 
at this point and so everything's kind
of<00:01:39.830> glitchy<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:40.970> rock<00:01:41.540> right<00:01:41.720> here<00:01:41.750> is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
of glitchy so this rock right here is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.109 
of glitchy so this rock right here is
invisible<00:01:42.560> like<00:01:43.100> not<00:01:43.250> invisible<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> can<00:01:43.910> go

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
invisible like not invisible you can go

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.730 
invisible like not invisible you can go
through<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.110> run<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.410> jump<00:01:45.440> through

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
through it so just run and jump through

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.770 
through it so just run and jump through
it<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:45.950> you'll<00:01:46.190> land<00:01:46.369> on<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.850> giant<00:01:47.509> flat

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
it and you'll land on this giant flat

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.770 
it and you'll land on this giant flat
area<00:01:48.140> down<00:01:48.320> here<00:01:48.800> now<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.300> be<00:01:50.420> on<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.660> this

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
area down here now if you be on to this

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.690 
area down here now if you be on to this
part<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.259> far<00:01:51.470> you've<00:01:51.680> basically<00:01:51.920> completed

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
part so far you've basically completed

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.130 
part so far you've basically completed
the<00:01:53.420> glitch<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.720> aren't<00:01:53.990> at<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
the glitch you aren't at the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.389 
the glitch you aren't at the
checkerboard<00:01:54.440> part<00:01:54.830> but<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.070> all<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
checkerboard part but that's all the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.600 
checkerboard part but that's all the
hard<00:01:55.580> parts<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:56.090> done<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:58.310> gonna<00:01:58.430> pull

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
hard parts are done so I'm gonna pull

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520 
hard parts are done so I'm gonna pull
out<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:58.759> sniper<00:01:59.119> here<00:01:59.420> real<00:02:00.080> quick<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.350> show

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
out my sniper here real quick to show

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.900 
out my sniper here real quick to show
you<00:02:00.590> where<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.100> checkerboard<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.700> cuz<00:02:01.850> you

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
you where the checkerboard is cuz you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.010 
you where the checkerboard is cuz you
can<00:02:02.030> actually<00:02:02.180> see<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.600> from<00:02:02.690> here<00:02:02.840> it's

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
can actually see it from here it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.139 
can actually see it from here it's
really<00:02:03.170> small<00:02:03.259> because<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:04.580> far<00:02:04.850> away

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
really small because it's so far away

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.410 
really small because it's so far away
and<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.770> if<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.610> lean<00:02:07.759> over<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.060> edge<00:02:08.149> here

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
and so if you lean over the edge here

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.120 
and so if you lean over the edge here
with<00:02:08.720> your<00:02:08.869> sniper<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.560> kind<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.890> look

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
with your sniper and you kind of look

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.970 
with your sniper and you kind of look
you'll<00:02:10.789> see<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.450> little<00:02:11.959> dot<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.470> zoom<00:02:12.680> in

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you'll see this little dot you zoom in

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.370 
you'll see this little dot you zoom in
that's<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.549> checkerboard<00:02:13.910> down<00:02:14.299> there<00:02:14.600> so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
that's the checkerboard down there so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.710 
that's the checkerboard down there so
fast-forwarding<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.280> part<00:02:16.600> you're<00:02:17.600> gonna

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
fast-forwarding this part you're gonna

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.680 
fast-forwarding this part you're gonna
want<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.049> just<00:02:18.260> run<00:02:19.120> until<00:02:20.120> you're<00:02:20.269> basically

across here and eventually get to the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.430 
across here and eventually get to the
checkerboard<00:02:37.670> you'll<00:02:37.940> just<00:02:38.269> look<00:02:38.420> down<00:02:38.660> kind

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
checkerboard you'll just look down kind

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.380 
checkerboard you'll just look down kind
of<00:02:39.500> line<00:02:39.709> your<00:02:39.890> crosshairs<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.580> with<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.910> if

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
of line your crosshairs up with it if

of line your crosshairs up with it if
you<00:02:41.540> can't<00:02:41.690> see<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.080> screen<00:02:42.110> should<00:02:42.709> be

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
you can't see it on my screen should be

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.140 
you can't see it on my screen should be
able<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> see<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.190> yours<00:02:43.489> pretty<00:02:43.700> clear<00:02:43.940> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
able to see it on yours pretty clear and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.750 
able to see it on yours pretty clear and
once<00:02:44.750> you've<00:02:44.870> lined<00:02:45.080> up<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:46.400> fall

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
once you've lined up with it just fall

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.660 
once you've lined up with it just fall
down<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.299> you'll<00:02:48.019> keep<00:02:48.170> falling<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.519> see

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
down and you'll keep falling you can see

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
down and you'll keep falling you can see
I<00:02:49.700> snipe<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.209> just<00:02:50.989> keep<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.380> your

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
I snipe in just keep it in your

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.080 
I snipe in just keep it in your
crosshairs<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.220> mean<00:02:52.579> you<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.790> move<00:02:52.970> around

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
crosshairs I mean you can move around

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.729 
crosshairs I mean you can move around
since<00:02:53.480> you're<00:02:53.600> in<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> air<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.350> know<00:02:54.530> I'm

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
since you're in the air so you know I'm

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.960 
since you're in the air so you know I'm
fast<00:02:54.950> for<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.459> because<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.820> really

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
fast for this up because it's a really

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.690 
fast for this up because it's a really
long<00:02:56.209> fall<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.950> course<00:02:58.010> line<00:02:58.549> it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
long fall so you can of course line it

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.030 
long fall so you can of course line it
up<00:02:58.820> any<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.090> your<00:02:59.150> crosshairs<00:02:59.890> because<00:03:00.890> it's

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
up any of your crosshairs because it's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.770 
up any of your crosshairs because it's
so<00:03:01.220> far<00:03:01.459> away<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.150> plenty<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.510> time<00:03:02.570> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
so far away you have plenty of time to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.140 
so far away you have plenty of time to
just<00:03:03.170> move<00:03:03.350> around<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.829> air<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.700> make<00:03:04.730> it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
just move around in the air to make it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.770 
just move around in the air to make it
once<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.900> fall<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.299> pretty<00:03:08.510> useless

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
once you fall so this is pretty useless

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.949 
once you fall so this is pretty useless
honestly<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.430> only<00:03:10.610> thing<00:03:10.730> I'd<00:03:10.850> really<00:03:11.090> use

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
honestly the only thing I'd really use

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.920 
honestly the only thing I'd really use
this<00:03:12.170> area<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:14.150> kind<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.540> unique

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
this area for it is kind of a unique

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.190 
this area for it is kind of a unique
place<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.919> duel<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.519> friends<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:17.959> if

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
place to duel your friends you know if

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.659 
place to duel your friends you know if
you're<00:03:18.350> in<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.530> part<00:03:18.799> if<00:03:18.919> you<00:03:19.010> know<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.190> game

you're in a part if you know a game

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.780 
you're in a part if you know a game
