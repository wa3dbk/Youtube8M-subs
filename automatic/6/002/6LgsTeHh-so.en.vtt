00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.979
Hi, I am Vidya Tikari and today I will be
doing a review on two products from Faces.

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:16.810
One is a blusher and one is a press powder.
They are both in the Glam On range. So I am

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.820
gonna start with the press powder first. So
it does has a protection factor in it. So

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.390
how am I gonna use it is with my Kabuki brush.
You can use a Kabuki brush or a sponge or

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.950
a powder brush which ever one you are comfortable
with. So I am just starting straight on the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.820
skin in small circular motion all the way
through and as you can see there is not too

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:55.930
much of cakeyness happening. It looks very
velvet like and it is quite fine in texture.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:05.610
It gives a nice matt finish. And besides being
mattifying it's really quite smooth. So it's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.960
got a silky velvety feel to it and it blends
really easily. The great thing about this

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.780
product is it's non comedogenic. It's Paraben
free and it's dermatologically tested. So

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.050
this product being SPF rich product it does
have a certain amount of protection in the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.190
product itself. So it is good for the skin.
So the Glam On press powder comes for 599

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.610
rupees for 9 grams and the shade which I have
used is 04 Sand. So out of 5 I will rate this

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.070
as 4. Now I will be reviewing Faces Glam On
blusher. And this colour is called Cocktail

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.920
Peach 04 and the great thing about this blusher
is, it has a slight shine to it. So when I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.920
apply it it's gonna give a slight natural
glow to the skin. So let's see how it works.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.130
So I am just using a blusher brush and instead
of just stroking it on we are gonna be tapping

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.780
it on the cheek bone. And when you tap it
on it gives a much more natural look as you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.640
can see. There's gonna be no stripes and no
streaks on the face. So as you can see this

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.130
blush is really easy to apply. It's not too
chalky or powdery. And more you build up the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.160
colour the more natural it looks and it gives
a really nice highlighting shine to the skin.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.130
And also it's Paraben free and these are the
pointers which we look for in cosmetics these

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.250
days. We want it to be Paraben free, we want
it to have a SPF factor in it where it protects

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.870
our skin and we want it to be relatively chemical
free. So these blushers and these powders

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.190
for me are definitely worth the buy. And besides
it being Paraben free it is also dermatologically

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.060
tested. So for those of you out there who
have sensitive skins I think it is a good

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.990
option. And from the feel of the skin it looks
natural it is not giving a patchy feel at

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:34.350
all and it is looking perfectly glowing. So
for me out of a five I will rate the Glam

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.430
On Faces Blush as a four and a half. So the
Faces Glam on Blusher Cocktail Peach 04 it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.550
for 499 rupees and it is five grams. So this
review was on the press powder and and the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.290
blusher from Faces. So any more information
that you would like to know about these products
