various reasons mostly because it's a

here that star Lord's holding that is an

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.790 
here that star Lord's holding that is an
affinity<00:00:55.590> stone<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:57.079> due<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.649> know

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
affinity stone now due to what we know

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
affinity stone now due to what we know
about<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> movie<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> far<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.420> appears<00:01:00.660> like

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
about the movie so far it appears like

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
about the movie so far it appears like
it<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> time<00:01:02.160> stone<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.870> time

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it will be the time stone or the time

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.969 
it will be the time stone or the time
gin<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:04.559> basically<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.519> lime<00:01:06.979> manipulate

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
gin which basically can lime manipulate

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
gin which basically can lime manipulate
time<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> degree<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> be

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
time to a degree which is going to be

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.300 
time to a degree which is going to be
pretty<00:01:09.930> cool<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.530> doubt<00:01:10.920> they're<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
pretty cool I doubt they're going to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.100 
pretty cool I doubt they're going to
make<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.670> 0<00:01:11.880> p<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> comics

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
make it as 0 p as it is in the comics

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920 
make it as 0 p as it is in the comics
just<00:01:13.920> because<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.659> really

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just because you know that would really

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.249 
just because you know that would really
make<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.650> too<00:01:17.280> hard<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.880> learn<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.479> but

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
make it too hard to learn with it but

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
make it too hard to learn with it but
what<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> seems<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
what it seems like it's going to be is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
what it seems like it's going to be is
we<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.509> star-lord<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> 80s<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.950> 70s

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we have star-lord in the 80s or 70s

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
we have star-lord in the 80s or 70s
which<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.299> hooked<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
which is why they have hooked on a

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.100 
which is why they have hooked on a
feeling<00:01:25.229> playing<00:01:25.850> first<00:01:26.850> off<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:28.020> know

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
feeling playing first off and you know

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
feeling playing first off and you know
star-lord<00:01:28.500> supposedly<00:01:28.979> has<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> walk<00:01:29.520> min<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
star-lord supposedly has a walk min so a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
star-lord supposedly has a walk min so a
little<00:01:30.329> nod<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.930> guess<00:01:31.079> him<00:01:31.650> being<00:01:31.950> from

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
little nod to I guess him being from

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
little nod to I guess him being from
different<00:01:32.460> time<00:01:32.640> period<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.689> anyways<00:01:34.049> he<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
different time period but anyways he I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
different time period but anyways he I
guess<00:01:34.950> finds<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.000> time<00:01:36.329> gem<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.840> time<00:01:37.140> stone

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
guess finds the time gem a time stone

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.719 
guess finds the time gem a time stone
and<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.520> sends<00:01:38.909> him<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.869> future<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
and it sends him into the future and

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.920 
and it sends him into the future and
obviously<00:01:41.729> Thanos<00:01:42.180> wants<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:42.720> he

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
obviously Thanos wants it because he

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
obviously Thanos wants it because he
wants<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> affinity<00:01:43.920> stones<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:44.939> any

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
wants all the affinity stones and if any

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
wants all the affinity stones and if any
gems<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.409> guess<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> collector<00:01:47.070> trying<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
gems and I guess a collector trying to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
gems and I guess a collector trying to
get<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> guess<00:01:48.869> that's<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.409> they're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
get it to so I guess that's how they're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
get it to so I guess that's how they're
gonna<00:01:49.740> explain<00:01:50.159> why<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.670> knows<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> involved

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
gonna explain why they knows is involved

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.609 
gonna explain why they knows is involved
and<00:01:51.810> yo<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.619> sends<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.280> nebula<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> know

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and yo he sends like nebula and you know

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.690 
and yo he sends like nebula and you know
Ronan<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> stuff<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
Ronan to like get it and stuff so all in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.789 
Ronan to like get it and stuff so all in
all<00:01:59.820> sounds<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> pretty<00:02:00.960> cool<00:02:01.259> plot<00:02:01.560> line

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
all sounds like a pretty cool plot line

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.630 
all sounds like a pretty cool plot line

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
pretty cool we don't know though it

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
pretty cool we don't know though it
could<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> reality<00:02:43.200> 12<00:02:43.560> probably<00:02:44.069> the

reality<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.300> about<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.630> just

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
reality one when I think about it just

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.650 
reality one when I think about it just
do<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> effect<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.950> magic<00:02:47.519> is<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.480> sense

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
do the effect that magic is in a sense

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.009 
do the effect that magic is in a sense
of<00:02:48.780> warping<00:02:49.050> reality<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:51.209> never<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.690> I'd

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
of warping reality but we never know I'd

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.870 
of warping reality but we never know I'd
be<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.530> cool<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:53.340> all<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.430> know<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:53.670> can

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
be really cool for all we know we can

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.699
