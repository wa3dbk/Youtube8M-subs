 I think it represents culture is 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.140
 a form of expression like marking a 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:27.790
 network with goats

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.880
 basically it is to introduce this pigment

 in the year 1991 there was a mummy 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.189
 inside a glacier 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 the mummy had his entire back tattooed 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.790
 You can say that the tattoo is so 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 old as man himself 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 the evolution of the tattoo begins in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.620
 Polynesia where the different tribes 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.870
 they used the tattoo as ornamentation 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.450
 body beyond its aesthetic sense 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.460
 the tattoo conferred hierarchy and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 propitiated community respect to those who 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 they were wearing it on their skin 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.560
 with reyli and edges high the brand 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 they invented the tattoo machine and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 they turned art into a profession 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 however the tattoo did not get rid of 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.050
 its inhuman tradition during the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.580
 Nazi Germany the tattoo was used to 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.390
 mark the prisoners of the fields 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 of concentration 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.460

 complications in the health area that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 we can not go unnoticed would be the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.090
 contamination by some type of gel in
