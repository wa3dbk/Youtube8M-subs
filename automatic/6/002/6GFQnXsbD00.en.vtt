00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.380
 yes 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.030
 the objective model was added to the series 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.640
 5 of bmw w in 2009 now after 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.210
 have sold more than one million mwv 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.939
 series 5 of the sixth generation goes to 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.270
 renewed face lift market both in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.390
 Regarding design as a technique but it is the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.750
 5 gt puniet spec series in sense 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.750
 classic 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.399
 The 5 gt series is not comparable to the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.809
 classic sedans combines the advantages of 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.750
 various types of cars in 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.089
 principle is a four-door sedan 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.000
 but as in the x5 the driver 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.820
 is sitting higher 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.220
 in a position from which he sees better the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.640
 traffic and the design is elegant as the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.640
 of a sedan 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.610
 We tried the extra 535i with the most engine 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.210
 small of the two gasoline that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 offers pm w a six cylinder with a pair 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.270
 maximum of 400 million meter and 225 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.790
 kilowatts of power price in 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.790
 germany 62 thousand three hundred euros 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.159
 two 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 the series 5 is the possibility of 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 program the browser by writing about 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:50.020
 a button let's find a destination like that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.799
 b 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.799
 and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 r plus the voice command variant 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.670
 destination 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.100
 I mentioned the location followed by street and 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.140
 number 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.819
 berlin street volta 66 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.100
 your command is processed like phoning 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.130
 with hands free one speaks but 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.080
 keep on the steering wheel you talk to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.160
 someone as if he were the companion in 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.160
 the seat next to 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.450
 the good thing about 5 great tourism is the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.240
 variability the back bench can be 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.850
 moved forward and backward and you can 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.610
 adjust the backrest so you get back 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.400
 a lot of space in the trunk 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.460
 the trunk offers a volume of 500 to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.430
 1,700 liters of cargo more than the version 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.430
 family that has thousand 670 liters 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.170
 it is a vehicle for long trips in the 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.740
 inside you have a lot of space 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.100
 particularly back the materials are 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.870
 high quality everything very luxurious this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.080
 auto is built to satisfy 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.970
 determined taste and circle of customers 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.510
 that's why relatively few are manufactured 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.510
 units 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.860
 a car for demanding customers and something 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.860
 extravagant 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.820
 inside the series 5 great tourism 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.450
 it's very different from the serious 5 normal 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:43.820
 the instrument panel is very elegant 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:46.820
 the center console somewhat wider 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.690
 backward vision leaves that yes something that 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.500
 wish for the shape of the body and 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:59.450
 the relatively small rear window is 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.220
 sees very few park backwards without 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.900
 camera is a challenge 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.900
 these are two photos 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
 conclusion 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.450
 as in every car also the series 5 gt 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.360
 has things that I like and others that I do not 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.600
 I like the instrument panel the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.240
 center console and less features 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.650
 I like the design behind but sitting 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.650
 I do not see it here
