something like that anyway towards the
end<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> level<00:02:53.970> when<00:02:54.209> you're<00:02:54.329> going

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
through the flood tunnel things like the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.210 
through the flood tunnel things like the
infected<00:02:58.079> tunnels<00:02:58.530> or<00:02:58.620> whatever<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.010> like

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
infected tunnels or whatever it's like

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.430 
infected tunnels or whatever it's like
the<00:02:59.370> very<00:02:59.579> end<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.879> the<00:02:59.909> level<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.200> come

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the very end of the level you come

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.809 
the very end of the level you come
across<00:03:01.709> these<00:03:02.010> three<00:03:02.370> like<00:03:02.609> white<00:03:02.970> elites<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
across these three like white elites and

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.940 
across these three like white elites and
one<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.940> them<00:03:06.030> has<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> glitch<00:03:06.599> Ted<00:03:06.900> which<00:03:07.680> has

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
one of them has a glitch Ted which has

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.869 
one of them has a glitch Ted which has
combat<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.060> assaults<00:03:09.930> mixed<00:03:10.530> their<00:03:11.370> combined

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
combat and assaults mixed their combined

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.119 
combat and assaults mixed their combined
I'm<00:03:12.269> sure<00:03:12.900> probably<00:03:13.349> everybody<00:03:13.859> knows<00:03:14.099> that

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
I'm sure probably everybody knows that

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.330 
I'm sure probably everybody knows that
by<00:03:14.489> now<00:03:14.670> enough<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.989> say<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.200> anyway<00:03:16.530> anyway

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
by now enough just say it anyway anyway

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.129 
by now enough just say it anyway anyway

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
if you use like a gravity hammer a sword

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.789 
if you use like a gravity hammer a sword
or<00:03:19.230> something<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:20.720> organoids<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.530> hit

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
or something a organoids and you hit

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.729 
or something a organoids and you hit
them<00:03:22.829> all<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.370> way<00:03:23.459> into<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.880> tall<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:25.530> hole

and you knock them down the hole on the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.119 
and you knock them down the hole on the
floor<00:03:30.530> if<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.709> break<00:03:32.099> open<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
I have the infection forms in them and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.710 
I have the infection forms in them and
let<00:03:40.230> them<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.530> infected<00:03:41.209> they<00:03:42.209> all<00:03:42.359> have

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
let them get infected they all have

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.170

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
no damage to you either so you can just

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.800 
no damage to you either so you can just
kind<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.699> stand<00:03:53.970> down<00:03:54.030> let<00:03:54.239> them<00:03:54.389> hit<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.690> and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
kind of stand down let them hit you and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.470

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
they won't do anything really but yeah

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.439 
they won't do anything really but yeah
so<00:03:57.750> that's<00:03:57.930> kind<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.379> where<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.889> got<00:03:59.489> this<00:03:59.730> idea

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
so that's kind of where I got this idea

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.990 
so that's kind of where I got this idea
from<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:02.430> yeah<00:04:02.609> that's<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.889> pretty<00:04:04.889> much<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.639> I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
from so yeah that's a pretty much it I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.280 
from so yeah that's a pretty much it I
think<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:09.079> size<00:04:10.079> comparison<00:04:10.400> I'll<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:12.290> carry

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
think a size comparison I'll just carry

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.509 
think a size comparison I'll just carry
him<00:04:13.590> over<00:04:14.060> here<00:04:15.859> I'm<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.010> going<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.280> stand

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
him over here I'm just going to stand

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.190 
him over here I'm just going to stand
him<00:04:17.729> up<00:04:17.849> in<00:04:18.060> size<00:04:18.329> comparison<00:04:18.780> we're<00:04:19.109> here

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
him up in size comparison we're here

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.440 
him up in size comparison we're here
there<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:22.090> than<00:04:22.510> here<00:04:23.350> G<00:04:23.560> Spartan<00:04:24.100> you
