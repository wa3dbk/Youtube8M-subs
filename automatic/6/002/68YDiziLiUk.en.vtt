00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.869 

it's<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.740> quick<00:00:01.890> demonstration<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.669> sound

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
it's a quick demonstration of the sound

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.940 
it's a quick demonstration of the sound
and<00:00:02.939> light<00:00:03.090> trigger<00:00:03.419> okay<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.470> let<00:00:04.650> me<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:04.740> go

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and light trigger okay so let me just go

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.140 
and light trigger okay so let me just go
down<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> buttons<00:00:05.430> first<00:00:05.850> thing<00:00:05.970> we've<00:00:06.120> got

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
down the buttons first thing we've got

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.020 
down the buttons first thing we've got
is<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.870> off<00:00:06.960> switch<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.529> we've<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.280> sense

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
is the off switch and we've got sense

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.669 
is the off switch and we've got sense
knob<00:00:09.269> which<00:00:09.420> can<00:00:09.570> change<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> sensitivity<00:00:10.170> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
knob which can change the sensitivity of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.220 
knob which can change the sensitivity of
it<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> sound<00:00:11.550> or<00:00:11.730> light<00:00:12.110> event<00:00:13.110> that's

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
it to the sound or light event that's

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.900 
it to the sound or light event that's
going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> take<00:00:13.530> place<00:00:13.650> delay<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.670> delay

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
going to take place delay the delay

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
going to take place delay the delay
between<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.299> unit<00:00:15.540> being<00:00:15.690> triggered<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
between the unit being triggered and the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.689 
between the unit being triggered and the
flash<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:19.070> button<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.250> referred<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.609> as

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
flash and button that we referred to as

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
flash and button that we referred to as
the<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.090> arm<00:00:21.390> button<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:24.230> just<00:00:25.230> an

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the the arm button and the just an

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
the the arm button and the just an
indicator<00:00:25.590> light<00:00:25.680> turn<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> round<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> we've

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
indicator light turn it round and we've

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.620 
indicator light turn it round and we've
got<00:00:27.199> three<00:00:28.199> sockets<00:00:28.939> that's<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.119> sound<00:00:30.449> we're

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
got three sockets that's for sound we're

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
got three sockets that's for sound we're
gonna<00:00:30.750> plug<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> mic<00:00:31.260> B<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.160> beam<00:00:32.340> we've

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
gonna plug in the mic B for beam we've

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
gonna plug in the mic B for beam we've
been<00:00:32.910> plugging<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> light<00:00:33.390> sensor<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.050> T<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
been plugging the light sensor and T is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380 
been plugging the light sensor and T is
the<00:00:34.980> trigger<00:00:35.219> output<00:00:35.399> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the trigger output we're going to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.490 
the trigger output we're going to
connect<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> flash<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.200> first<00:00:37.350> thing<00:00:37.440> I'm

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
connect the flash so first thing I'm

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.670 
connect the flash so first thing I'm
going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> set<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.960> sound<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
going to do is set it up for sound so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.580 
going to do is set it up for sound so
plug<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> plug<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> microphone<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.590> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
plug that plug the microphone into the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.970 
plug that plug the microphone into the
socket<00:00:44.780> around<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> tank<00:00:46.110> switch<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> unit

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
socket around the tank switch the unit

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.380 
socket around the tank switch the unit
on<00:00:47.250> well<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> first<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
on well the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
on well the first thing I'm gonna do is
set<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> sensitivity<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> turn<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
set the sensitivity see if I turn the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340 
set the sensitivity see if I turn the
sensitivity<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> full<00:00:51.690> it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sensitivity right up to full it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
sensitivity right up to full it's
picking<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:52.829> background<00:00:53.250> noise<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
picking up some background noise and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.240 
picking up some background noise and
it's<00:00:54.090> basically<00:00:54.329> firing<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> unit

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
it's basically firing the unit

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.900 
it's basically firing the unit
constantly<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.300> need<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> back<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> off

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
constantly so just need to back that off

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
constantly so just need to back that off
until<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.050> light<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
until we get the light going out there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
until we get the light going out there
we<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.879> fill<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
we go and you can fill it with this and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
we go and you can fill it with this and
just<00:01:04.229> try<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.799> sensitive<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
just try and get it as sensitive as you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
just try and get it as sensitive as you
can<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.570> they're<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.170> bit

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
can you can see they're a little bit

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
can you can see they're a little bit
it's<00:01:07.710> picking<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.310> voice<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:09.420> talking

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's picking up my voice as I'm talking

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.620 
it's picking up my voice as I'm talking
and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:12.060> pretty<00:01:12.210> good<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:14.630> see

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and so we're we're pretty good I do see

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
and so we're we're pretty good I do see
the<00:01:16.140> light<00:01:16.259> flashing<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.740> show<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.130> being

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the light flashing that show it's being

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.800 
the light flashing that show it's being
triggered<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.030> test<00:01:18.270> mode<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
triggered this is test mode so in this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
triggered this is test mode so in this
mode<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.500> set<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.420> test<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.810> you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
mode you set it up and test what you're

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
mode you set it up and test what you're
going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.830> check<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> light<00:01:23.369> flashes

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
going to do and check the light flashes

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.600 
going to do and check the light flashes
and<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.540> triggering<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> unit

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and it's actually triggering the unit

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
and it's actually triggering the unit
next<00:01:26.610> we're<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> connect<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.650> flash

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
next we're going to connect the flash

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
next we're going to connect the flash
first<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.729> demonstration<00:01:30.150> we'll<00:01:30.570> start

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
first for this demonstration we'll start

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
first for this demonstration we'll start
off<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> de<00:01:31.200> litter<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> zero

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
off with the de litter and down to zero

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
off with the de litter and down to zero
so<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.369> eyes<00:01:32.520> instantly<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.600> let's<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.320> sure

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so if eyes instantly so let's make sure

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.760 
so if eyes instantly so let's make sure
to<00:01:34.560> switch<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> flash<00:01:35.880> off<00:01:36.200> plug<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to switch the flash off plug it into the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.350 
to switch the flash off plug it into the
the<00:01:38.220> T<00:01:38.400> socket<00:01:40.700> switch<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> flash<00:01:42.350> back<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the T socket switch the flash back on

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.560 
the T socket switch the flash back on
and<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.829> check<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.970> charge<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.180> assuming

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and just check that charge not assuming

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.910 
and just check that charge not assuming
it<00:01:48.659> testify<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.079> yeah<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.590> go

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it testify it yeah there we go

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.520 
it testify it yeah there we go
okay<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.390> next<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
okay so next I'm going to do then is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.270 
okay so next I'm going to do then is
actually<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.600> do<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> treat<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> flash<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
actually do do a treat of the flash so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.069 
actually do do a treat of the flash so
now<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.880> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> tell<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> next

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
now I need to tell it that the next

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:58.550 
now I need to tell it that the next
flasher

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
flasher

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
flasher
I<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.100> want<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.810> fire<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I do I want it to actually fire the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
I do I want it to actually fire the
flash<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> press<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> arm<00:02:02.759> button<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:05.119> then

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
flash so I press the arm button and then

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.540 
flash so I press the arm button and then
that<00:02:06.149> trigger<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> unit<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> flashes

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that trigger the unit and it flashes

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.359 
that trigger the unit and it flashes
just<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.330> again

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
just do that again

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.259 
just do that again
and<00:02:11.440> there<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.560> go<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.849> let's<00:02:14.000> do<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and there we go and so let's do with the

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.309 
and there we go and so let's do with the
delay<00:02:14.420> now<00:02:14.569> tended<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.440> lay<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> fall

button one two three

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.820 
button one two three
flash<00:02:25.129> and<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:26.629> Silas<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.530> about<00:02:27.620> three

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
flash and it's Silas it's about three

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.250 
flash and it's Silas it's about three
and<00:02:27.860> half<00:02:27.950> seconds<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.580> time<00:02:29.239> delay<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.140> not

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.949 
and half seconds a time delay it's not
calibrated<00:02:30.799> just<00:02:31.280> need<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.000> set<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.569> do

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
calibrated just need to to set it and do

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.330 
calibrated just need to to set it and do
it<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.110> little<00:02:33.530> bit<00:02:33.680> by<00:02:33.799> trial<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.220> error

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it a little bit by trial and error

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.250 
it a little bit by trial and error
depending<00:02:35.269> on<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.720> event<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.019> actually

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
depending on the event you actually

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.900 
depending on the event you actually
trying<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.470> do<00:02:36.650> obviously<00:02:37.099> of<00:02:37.370> course<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.730> can

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
trying to do obviously of course you can

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.479 
trying to do obviously of course you can
move<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.420> distance<00:02:38.750> between<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.190> microphone

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
move the distance between the microphone

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.199 
move the distance between the microphone
and<00:02:40.879> what<00:02:41.450> you're<00:02:41.569> doing<00:02:41.660> as<00:02:41.870> well<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.970> I'm

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
and what you're doing as well so I'm

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.949 
and what you're doing as well so I'm
just<00:02:44.329> gonna<00:02:44.450> show<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.599> one<00:02:44.720> more<00:02:44.810> feature

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
just gonna show you one more feature

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.990 
just gonna show you one more feature
before<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.380> change<00:02:45.620> over<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.920> light<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.790> that

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
before I change over to light and that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.740 
before I change over to light and that
is<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:48.290> power<00:02:48.530> reminder<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:50.510> I'm

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
is just the power reminder so if I'm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440 
is just the power reminder so if I'm
just<00:02:51.370> leave<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.519> for<00:02:52.549> 30<00:02:52.790> seconds<00:02:53.299> without

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
just leave it for 30 seconds without

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:12.000 
just leave it for 30 seconds without
being<00:02:53.780> triggered

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.190 

their<00:03:13.010> light<00:03:13.340> comes<00:03:13.550> on<00:03:13.700> light<00:03:14.510> comes<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:14.870> and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
their light comes on light comes on and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.930 
their light comes on light comes on and
this<00:03:15.379> just<00:03:15.560> as<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.709> power<00:03:15.920> on<00:03:16.069> indicator<00:03:16.220> also

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
this just as a power on indicator also

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.729 
this just as a power on indicator also
have<00:03:17.180> triggered<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.540> straight<00:03:17.810> away<00:03:18.200> again

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
have triggered it straight away again

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.949 
have triggered it straight away again
thereby<00:03:19.069> talking<00:03:19.519> but<00:03:20.060> if<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.569> leave<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:20.780> 30

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
thereby talking but if you leave for 30

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.500 
thereby talking but if you leave for 30
seconds<00:03:21.319> light<00:03:21.470> or<00:03:21.620> come<00:03:21.769> on<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.390> stay<00:03:23.390> on

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
seconds light or come on and stay on

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.580 
seconds light or come on and stay on
until<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.930> triggered<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.379> when<00:03:24.470> it's

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
until it's triggered and when it's

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.660 
until it's triggered and when it's
triggered<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.890> will<00:03:24.920> go<00:03:25.099> back<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.459> test

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
triggered it will go back in the test

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.490 
triggered it will go back in the test
mode<00:03:25.819> that's<00:03:26.330> just<00:03:26.510> comes<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.379> as

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
mode that's just comes on is it just as

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.250 
mode that's just comes on is it just as
a<00:03:27.530> reminder<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:29.510> power<00:03:29.780> switched<00:03:30.080> on<00:03:30.260> so

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
a reminder that the power switched on so

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.400 
a reminder that the power switched on so
let's<00:03:33.260> change<00:03:33.500> over<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:35.599> light<00:03:35.989> sensing

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
let's change over to the light sensing

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.820 
let's change over to the light sensing
out<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:37.040> take<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.700> off<00:03:40.180> plug<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:42.110> light<00:03:42.440> sensor

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
out so take it off plug the light sensor

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.390 
out so take it off plug the light sensor
in<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:44.319> now<00:03:45.319> here<00:03:45.590> I've<00:03:45.860> got<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.040> lamp<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.310> up

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
in and now here I've got a lamp on up

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400 
in and now here I've got a lamp on up
here<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.790> see<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.269> shadow<00:03:47.480> up<00:03:47.569> there<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.319> and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
here you see the shadow up there so and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.319 
here you see the shadow up there so and
I<00:03:48.470> should<00:03:48.680> point<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:48.950> towards<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.310> lamp<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:50.180> as

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
I should point it towards a lamp and as

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.940 
I should point it towards a lamp and as
you<00:03:50.390> can<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:50.660> there<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.530> even<00:03:51.799> though<00:03:51.920> I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
you can see there that even though I

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.949 
you can see there that even though I
haven't<00:03:52.130> got<00:03:52.220> an<00:03:52.310> actual<00:03:52.579> beam<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.150> light<00:03:53.329> it's

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
haven't got an actual beam of light it's

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.780 
haven't got an actual beam of light it's
reacting<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.410> changes<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.010> light<00:03:55.190> so

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
reacting the changes in the light so

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.150 
reacting the changes in the light so
this<00:03:55.910> couldn't<00:03:56.209> react<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:57.470> any<00:03:57.620> sort<00:03:58.099> of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
this couldn't react to to any sort of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.460 
this couldn't react to to any sort of
significant<00:03:58.819> change<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.209> light<00:03:59.360> so<00:04:00.140> turn<00:04:00.440> it

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
significant change in light so turn it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.440 
significant change in light so turn it
around<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:01.099> to<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.970> ambient<00:04:02.299> light

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
around just to the the ambient light

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.890 
around just to the the ambient light

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
just going to stop this a minute while I

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.159 
just going to stop this a minute while I

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
set up for for the light beam okay I

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.390 
set up for for the light beam okay I
settle<00:04:30.380> for<00:04:30.410> beam<00:04:30.620> now<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.860> can<00:04:31.039> see<00:04:31.220> I'm<00:04:31.340> just

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
settle for beam now you can see I'm just

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.570 
settle for beam now you can see I'm just

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.310 
using a village level $1.99 or fee bear
and<00:04:34.820> all<00:04:35.240> about<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.539> do<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.720> take<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:35.960> lens<00:04:36.139> out

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
and all about to do is take the lens out

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.089 
and all about to do is take the lens out
so<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.650> gives<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.919> spot<00:04:37.280> instead<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.300> giving<00:04:38.539> a

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
so it gives a spot instead of giving a

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.820 
so it gives a spot instead of giving a

beam align to the Builder which you

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.710 
beam align to the Builder which you
would<00:04:42.950> use<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.460> get<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.610> level<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.570> should

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
would use to get a level so you should

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.000 
would use to get a level so you should
pull<00:04:44.810> up<00:04:44.900> there<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.380> also<00:04:45.500> see<00:04:45.800> here<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:48.010> the

through<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.840> beam<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.700> can<00:04:58.700> see<00:04:58.880> they're

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
through the beam you can see they're

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.950 
through the beam you can see they're
just<00:04:59.330> triggering<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.229> unit<00:05:01.840> another<00:05:02.840> thing

just triggering the unit another thing

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.650 
just triggering the unit another thing
I've<00:05:03.050> done<00:05:03.289> is<00:05:03.500> put<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.940> extension<00:05:05.180> lead<00:05:05.510> on

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
I've done is put the extension lead on

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.409 
I've done is put the extension lead on
here<00:05:05.810> just<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.080> 3.5<00:05:06.620> millimeter<00:05:07.070> jack

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
here just a 3.5 millimeter jack

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.850 
here just a 3.5 millimeter jack
extension<00:05:08.419> lead<00:05:08.599> so<00:05:09.139> I've<00:05:09.229> got<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.410> in<00:05:09.560> my<00:05:09.620> room

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
extension lead so I've got it in my room

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.790 
extension lead so I've got it in my room
to<00:05:10.190> position<00:05:10.520> my<00:05:10.580> flash<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:12.500> other<00:05:12.620> thing

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
to position my flash and the other thing

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.110 
to position my flash and the other thing
you<00:05:12.889> can<00:05:13.070> do<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:15.639> same<00:05:16.639> thing<00:05:16.820> for<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.000> like

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
you can do is to same thing for you like

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.969 
you can do is to same thing for you like
sensor<00:05:17.419> put<00:05:17.570> on<00:05:17.630> an<00:05:17.690> extension<00:05:18.139> lead<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:18.950> that

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
sensor put on an extension lead so that

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.790 
sensor put on an extension lead so that
see<00:05:19.310> not<00:05:20.020> every<00:05:21.020> time<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.260> took<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.440> unit

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
see not every time you took to unit

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.030 
see not every time you took to unit
you're<00:05:21.890> not<00:05:21.979> risking<00:05:22.219> brick<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.610> beam

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
you're not risking brick in the beam

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.100 
you're not risking brick in the beam
so<00:05:25.040> now<00:05:25.220> let's<00:05:25.580> do<00:05:25.760> fire<00:05:26.480> so<00:05:26.720> again<00:05:26.870> just<00:05:27.050> check

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
so now let's do fire so again just check

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.380 
so now let's do fire so again just check
to<00:05:27.320> work<00:05:27.440> in<00:05:27.620> I'm<00:05:28.160> gonna<00:05:28.340> arm<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:31.390> next

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
to work in I'm gonna arm it and next

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.040 
to work in I'm gonna arm it and next
time<00:05:32.510> a<00:05:32.540> bit<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.750> beam<00:05:33.250> flash<00:05:34.810> let's<00:05:35.810> do<00:05:35.930> it

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
time a bit the beam flash let's do it

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.510 
time a bit the beam flash let's do it
faster<00:05:36.380> can<00:05:36.740> this<00:05:36.890> time<00:05:37.510> arm<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:39.490> flash

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
faster can this time arm it and flash

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.120 
faster can this time arm it and flash
I've<00:05:41.030> actually<00:05:41.210> fired<00:05:41.510> an<00:05:41.600> air<00:05:41.720> rifle<00:05:42.130> pellet

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
I've actually fired an air rifle pellet

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.340 
I've actually fired an air rifle pellet
through<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.580> beam<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:43.940> it<00:05:44.900> will<00:05:45.020> react<00:05:45.320> to

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
through the beam and it will react to

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.620 
through the beam and it will react to
that<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.130> is<00:05:46.250> very<00:05:46.460> sensitive<00:05:49.330> right<00:05:50.330> set

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
that so it is very sensitive right set

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.800 
that so it is very sensitive right set
up<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:51.110> do<00:05:51.590> a<00:05:51.890> remote<00:05:52.400> shutter<00:05:52.700> release<00:05:52.810> so

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
up to do a remote shutter release so

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.430 
up to do a remote shutter release so
I'll<00:05:53.960> back<00:05:54.140> onto<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:58.250> sound<00:05:58.460> trigger<00:05:59.440> and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
I'll back onto the sound trigger and

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.110 
I'll back onto the sound trigger and
what<00:06:00.830> here<00:06:01.010> it's<00:06:01.190> just<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:03.520> remod<00:06:04.520> cable

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
what here it's just a remod cable

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.630 
what here it's just a remod cable
