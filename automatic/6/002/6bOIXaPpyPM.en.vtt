really good because looks like bad thing
at<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> same<00:00:58.920> time<00:00:59.250> his<00:00:59.940> team<00:01:00.300> should<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
at the same time his team should be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
at the same time his team should be
careful<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.300> um<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
careful because like I think that um I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
careful because like I think that um I
think<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:07.369> since<00:01:08.369> he's<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> owner

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think that like since he's the owner

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.539 
think that like since he's the owner
that<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.720> should<00:01:09.960> listen<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.439> him<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.369> mean

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that you should listen to him but I mean

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
that you should listen to him but I mean
at<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> same<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.119> she's<00:01:12.510> been<00:01:12.689> racist<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
at the same time she's been racist and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.020 
this and the video link will be down in
the<00:01:32.729> description<00:01:32.820> home<00:01:33.689> some

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the description home some

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.109 
the description home some
during<00:01:34.810> their<00:01:35.020> jerseys<00:01:35.470> inside<00:01:35.770> out<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
during their jerseys inside out and

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.380 
during their jerseys inside out and
they're<00:01:37.930> protesting<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.090> think

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
they're protesting basically I think

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.800 
they're protesting basically I think
they<00:01:40.540> want<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.780> get<00:01:40.869> rid<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.140> him<00:01:41.940> but<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.420> can't

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
they want to get rid of him but it can't

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.539 
they want to get rid of him but it can't
because<00:01:44.619> he<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.909> owner<00:01:46.119> of<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.960> team<00:01:47.549> so

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
because he is the owner of the team so

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.960 
because he is the owner of the team so
anyways<00:01:49.479> um<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:50.500> don't<00:01:51.369> know<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.670> really<00:01:51.850> a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
anyways um I don't know it's really a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.149 
anyways um I don't know it's really a
difficult<00:01:52.210> decision<00:01:52.570> because<00:01:53.020> it's<00:01:53.320> like<00:01:53.560> you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
difficult decision because it's like you

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.870 
difficult decision because it's like you
wanna<00:01:54.700> leave<00:01:55.690> living<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:57.220> then<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.580> can't

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
wanna leave living but then you can't

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.670 
wanna leave living but then you can't
because<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.720> um<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:01.149> are<00:02:01.600> owned<00:02:01.899> by<00:02:01.930> someone
