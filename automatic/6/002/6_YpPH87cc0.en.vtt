in a triathlon or anything longer and in
that<00:01:05.120> athlete<00:01:05.630> when<00:01:06.350> they<00:01:06.500> hit<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.460> point

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
that athlete when they hit that point

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.310 
that athlete when they hit that point
it's<00:01:08.030> sometimes<00:01:08.420> called<00:01:08.660> hitting<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.110> wall

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
it's sometimes called hitting the wall

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.990 
it's sometimes called hitting the wall
or<00:01:09.650> bonking<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:12.070> serious<00:01:13.070> fuel<00:01:13.460> crisis

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
or bonking that is a serious fuel crisis

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.929 
or bonking that is a serious fuel crisis
especially<00:01:14.660> for<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.260> brain<00:01:15.759> because<00:01:16.759> it's

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
especially for the brain because it's

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.969 
especially for the brain because it's
looking<00:01:17.509> for<00:01:17.689> glucose<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.350> it's<00:01:18.470> not<00:01:18.650> there

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
looking for glucose and it's not there

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.030 
looking for glucose and it's not there
and<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.119> starts<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.960> get<00:01:21.409> very<00:01:21.439> angry<00:01:21.770> and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
and so it starts to get very angry and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.359 
and so it starts to get very angry and
shut<00:01:22.460> down<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.689> know<00:01:23.840> muscle<00:01:24.740> contraction

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
shut down you know muscle contraction

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.210 
shut down you know muscle contraction
and<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:26.150> host<00:01:26.329> of<00:01:26.509> other<00:01:27.939> events<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.180> really

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and a host of other events that really

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.149 
and a host of other events that really
terminate<00:01:31.220> exercise<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.680> there's<00:01:34.070> a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
terminate exercise and and there's a

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.800 
terminate exercise and and there's a
strong<00:01:34.460> drive<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:34.970> seek<00:01:35.210> out<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.720> know

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
strong drive to seek out you know

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.710 
strong drive to seek out you know
carbohydrates<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.759> provide<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.970> fuel<00:01:38.299> but

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
carbohydrates to provide that fuel but

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.899 
carbohydrates to provide that fuel but
when<00:01:38.840> you're<00:01:38.960> keto<00:01:39.170> adapted<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.430> brain<00:01:40.700> is

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
when you're keto adapted the brain is

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.139 
when you're keto adapted the brain is
has<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.600> steady<00:01:42.049> source<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.890> fuel<00:01:43.579> by<00:01:43.909> way<00:01:44.119> of

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
has a steady source of fuel by way of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.870 
has a steady source of fuel by way of
fatty<00:01:44.840> acids<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.560> ketones<00:01:46.189> for<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.610> brain

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
fatty acids and ketones for the brain

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.859 
fatty acids and ketones for the brain
and<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.100> we've<00:01:49.360> talked<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.570> several

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
and so we've talked with several

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.039 
and so we've talked with several
endurance<00:01:51.740> athletes<00:01:52.250> were<00:01:53.240> key<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.479> adapted

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
endurance athletes were key to adapted

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.700 
endurance athletes were key to adapted
who<00:01:54.229> tell<00:01:54.950> us<00:01:54.979> they're<00:01:55.460> both<00:01:55.909> proof<00:01:56.469> that<00:01:57.469> they

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
who tell us they're both proof that they

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.840 
who tell us they're both proof that they
they<00:01:58.009> don't<00:01:58.130> hit<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.520> wall<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.469> this<00:02:00.619> is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
they don't hit the wall and so this is

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.209 
they don't hit the wall and so this is
you<00:02:01.850> know<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.060> is<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.750> type<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.219> exercise

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
you know this is one type of exercise

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.020 
you know this is one type of exercise
that<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.490> think<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:04.850> very<00:02:05.619> well<00:02:06.619> suited<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.369> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that I think is very well suited to a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.969 
that I think is very well suited to a
ketogenic<00:02:08.600> diet<00:02:08.810> but<00:02:08.990> we<00:02:09.080> also<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.649> know<00:02:09.710> I'm

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
ketogenic diet but we also you know I'm

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.220 
ketogenic diet but we also you know I'm
a<00:02:10.250> power<00:02:10.550> lifter<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.810> at<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> other

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
a power lifter so I'm I'm at the other

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.560 
a power lifter so I'm I'm at the other

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
performing it at a high level so I think

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.070 
performing it at a high level so I think
it's<00:02:44.010> compatible<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.360> range<00:02:45.900> of

it's compatible with a range of
