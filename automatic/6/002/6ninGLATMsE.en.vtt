and you're also going to add more
calories<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.920> opt<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> slice<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> one

whole wheat roll to sun-dried tomatoes

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
whole wheat roll to sun-dried tomatoes
so<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.239> may<00:00:51.360> look<00:00:51.510> at<00:00:51.629> sun-dried<00:00:52.020> tomatoes<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so we may look at sun-dried tomatoes and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
so we may look at sun-dried tomatoes and
think<00:00:52.860> i'm<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.850> great

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
think i'm going to put more great

nutrients<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:55.110> salad<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:56.039> you're

nutrients on my salad but what you're

nutrients on my salad but what you're
really<00:00:56.340> putting<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.820> salad<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> ton<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really putting on your salad is a ton of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
really putting on your salad is a ton of
sodium<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.309> sun-dried<00:00:59.850> tomatoes<00:01:00.329> tend<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
sodium so sun-dried tomatoes tend to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
sodium so sun-dried tomatoes tend to
have<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.379> lot<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> sodium<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.550> half<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.910> cup

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
have a lot of sodium just a half a cup

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
have a lot of sodium just a half a cup
can<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.629> almost<00:01:03.780> 500<00:01:04.530> milligrams<00:01:05.040> of

can have them almost 500 milligrams of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
can have them almost 500 milligrams of
that<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.119> sodium<00:01:06.479> bomb<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that it's a sodium bomb that you want to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
that it's a sodium bomb that you want to
avoid<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.000> raw<00:01:09.210> fresh<00:01:09.659> tomatoes

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
