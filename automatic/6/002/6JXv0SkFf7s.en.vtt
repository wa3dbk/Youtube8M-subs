00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.320
 hi with you alexander hippolit and in 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.469
 This tutorial, I will show you how to shoot salutes 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.019
 and fireworks and equipment to us 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.820
 will be required by the state 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.970
 a camera that can shoot with 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.060
 set manually by shutter speed in idea this 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.920
 there should be a bold mode 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.920
 there is almost every mirror 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.259
 cameras the essence of this mode is 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.699
 that we can manually set 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.430
 theatrical and issue 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.020
 and the shutter open on the necessary for us 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.920
 time that is press the shutter button 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.129
 shutter opened the shutter release button released 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.350
 shutter closed for this we do not need 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.969
 set exposure value in advance 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.469
 because it opens the shutter 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:52.449
 we need time however when the camera 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.180
 stands on a tripod and we manually open 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.090
 shutter press the shutter button the camera 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.969
 can stagger and we'll get oiled 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.010
 therefore it is better not for such purposes the remote 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.130
 remote control or cable 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.460
 the descent as a remote and cable and you can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.170
 buy for ridiculous prices let's say on ebay 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 This item costs about 300 rubles. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.759
 it remains to learn about where and when will 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.950
 salute and many come in advance 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.710
 novice photographers allow rough 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.100
 mistake coming shoot a salute right before 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.320
 his command eventually obtained an enormous 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.680
 the number of people who are blocking 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.100
 all the action and they are able to put 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.710
 tripod 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.079
 in the right place it is therefore necessary 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.049
 pre-select a place after finding out where it will be 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.420
 It is better to launch salvos like this 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.399
 the place where in the background salute will be 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.380
 find out the places of your city 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.590
 well, or this city where you shoot 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.219
 when I filmed the salute of the castle produced 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 with barge 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.380
 which stood in the middle of the river I came 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 take a solid place from 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.270
 convenient to watch it is not going to 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.729
 the main crowd from the back of the river 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 just a view of the city and overlooking the whole 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.090
 crowd and so well when usually places 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.369
 you need to install a tripod and fix 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.320
 him so that he does not falter that is when 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.080
 need to even load stir 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.880
 heavy bag firmly secure the camera 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.700
 Next, set the mode 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.240
 Bank and make up within 100 200 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 units aperture I closed until the next 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.910
 value to more space 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.100
 climbed into the depth of field and the next 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.230
 very important step is necessary 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.320
 focus on where they will be from 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.360
 go hall as it is usually seen in advance in 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.800
 my case is a barge and now 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.860
 need to switch 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.690
 autofocus in manual mode to 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.370
 he wriggled 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.260
 however, remember that if you climb 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.070
 use zoom then focus 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.520
 will be required 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.520
 reconfigure further connect the cable and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.980
 let's start shooting as soon as 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.410
 our seize the first volley I opened 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.050
 shutter and shut it when few 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 volleys exploded in the sky but not yet 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.200
 went out 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.830
 that is to say so at the peak of their king and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.769
 so we do with all the volleys 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.320
 take a series of shots of 6 12 seconds a 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.260
 if the background is too dark 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.450
 then increase from 100 150 units 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.060
 the most important thing is to take more pictures 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.040
 so that there was something to choose from 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.519
 and I end up with these 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.519
