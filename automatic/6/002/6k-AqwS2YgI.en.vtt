in one of our earlier web design trends
videos<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:06.359> talked<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:07.760> text<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.940> making

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
videos we talked about text and making

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.970 
videos we talked about text and making
it<00:00:09.420> more<00:00:09.570> interesting<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.500> people<00:00:10.889> are

using it to liven up their websites well
another<00:00:14.490> trend<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.969> want<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> talk<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.480> you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
another trend that I want to talk to you

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.630 
another trend that I want to talk to you
guys<00:00:15.630> about<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.369> actually<00:00:17.369> quite<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
guys about is actually quite the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.330 
guys about is actually quite the
opposite<00:00:18.180> which<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.480> less<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.500> less<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
opposite which is less and less use of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
opposite which is less and less use of
text<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> websites<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.230> only<00:00:22.680> three

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
text in websites so I have only three

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.439 
text in websites so I have only three
examples<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.820> I'd<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.180> show<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> guys

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
examples that I'd like to show you guys

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.330 
examples that I'd like to show you guys
today<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.529> they're<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:26.070> really

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
today but I think they're really really

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
today but I think they're really really
good<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.000> illustrate<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.779> trying

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
good and they illustrate what I'm trying

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.589 
good and they illustrate what I'm trying
to<00:00:28.140> convey<00:00:28.460> really<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to convey really really well so this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
to convey really really well so this
first<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.349> gonna<00:00:31.619> actually<00:00:31.800> reload<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
first one I'm gonna actually reload it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.610 
first one I'm gonna actually reload it
so<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> loading<00:00:33.719> effect<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so you can see the loading effect it's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
so you can see the loading effect it's
really<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.309> cool<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.239> uses<00:00:36.690> really

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
really really cool and it uses really

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
really really cool and it uses really
purely<00:00:37.500> pictures<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
on them it kind of moves just that thing

on them it kind of moves just that thing
and<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.829> make<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> move

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and you can do this you know make a move

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.479 
and you can do this you know make a move
anywhere<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> also<00:00:51.780> notice<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:53.010> title

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
anywhere and also notice that the title

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.240 
anywhere and also notice that the title
the<00:00:53.820> navigation<00:00:54.809> bar<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the navigation bar as you can see at the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720 
the navigation bar as you can see at the
top<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.270> splits<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.070> five<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
top kind of splits up into five to the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
top kind of splits up into five to the
five<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:00.329> categories<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
five different categories and you can

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.200 
five different categories and you can
move<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> around<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> thought<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.059> was

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
move it around so I thought that was

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.549 
move it around so I thought that was
really<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.480> cool<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.229> uses<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
really really cool because it uses a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.370 
really really cool because it uses a
minimal<00:01:05.070> amount<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.369> text<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> course<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:07.170> has

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
minimal amount of text of course it has

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
minimal amount of text of course it has
this<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> uses<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> minimal<00:01:09.540> amount

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this here but it uses a minimal amount

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
this here but it uses a minimal amount
of<00:01:09.869> text<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:12.510> does<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.350> good

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of text and it does a really really good

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.460 
of text and it does a really really good
job<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.070> getting<00:01:14.970> across<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
job of getting across what they do this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
job of getting across what they do this
is<00:01:16.650> obviously<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.280> opens<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.970> their

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
is obviously it opens up to their

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
is obviously it opens up to their
portfolio<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> their<00:01:18.990> navigation<00:01:19.650> bars<00:01:19.860> at

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
portfolio and their navigation bars at

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
portfolio and their navigation bars at
the<00:01:20.070> bottom<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.270> click<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:21.840> us

the bottom and you can click on about us

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170

or<00:01:22.380> clients<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.340> whatever<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
or clients or whatever you want so I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
or clients or whatever you want so I
thought<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:24.960> cool<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
thought that was really really cool it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.929 
thought that was really really cool it
uses<00:01:25.710> primarily<00:01:26.460> pictures<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> beginning

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
uses primarily pictures in the beginning

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.660 
uses primarily pictures in the beginning
to<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.229> grab<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.590> viewers<00:01:31.950> attention<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to really grab the viewers attention and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420 
to really grab the viewers attention and
draw<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.770> hopefully<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.130> doing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
draw them in and hopefully with doing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.710 
draw them in and hopefully with doing
that<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.240> viewer<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:38.600> click<00:01:39.600> on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that then the viewer will go to click on

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
that then the viewer will go to click on
other<00:01:39.869> things<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.829> around<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
other things and look around on the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
other things and look around on the
website<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.659> thought<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
website so i thought that was a really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
website so i thought that was a really
really<00:01:43.530> cool<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> doing<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.030> next

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
really cool way of doing that the next

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.370 
really cool way of doing that the next
is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> company<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.229> familiar

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that and then this is actually just a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.330 
that and then this is actually just a
picture<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> concept

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
picture right here this is a concept

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.960 
picture right here this is a concept
that<00:02:11.459> someone<00:02:12.090> designed<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that someone designed on a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.310 
that someone designed on a
site<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> part<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.900> for<00:02:15.140> web

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
site that I'm a part of for web

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.080 
site that I'm a part of for web
designers<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> concept<00:02:16.850> that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
designers and this is a concept that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.120 
designers and this is a concept that
this<00:02:17.300> person<00:02:17.690> created<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.530> uploaded<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.100> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
this person created that uploaded it to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.680 
this person created that uploaded it to
the<00:02:19.280> website<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:20.030> was<00:02:20.120> looking<00:02:20.240> around<00:02:20.450> on

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the website what was looking around on

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.670 
the website what was looking around on
it<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.960> thought<00:02:21.200> it'd<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.320> really<00:02:21.500> really

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it and I thought it'd be really really

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.780 
it and I thought it'd be really really
cool<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.130> want<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.340> show<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.610> guys<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.870> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
cool so I want to show you guys it's a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.870 
cool so I want to show you guys it's a
dashboard<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> client<00:02:27.800> or<00:02:28.130> whatever

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
and this is this is their idea of their

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.730 
and this is this is their idea of their
dashboard<00:02:32.600> for<00:02:32.810> their<00:02:32.960> website<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.470> they<00:02:33.500> can

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
thought this did a really really good

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.360 
thought this did a really really good
job<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.760> illustrating<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:45.940> lack<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:46.970> texts

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
job of illustrating the lack of texts

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
job of illustrating the lack of texts
they<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.910> very<00:02:50.480> very<00:02:50.750> minimal<00:02:51.020> amount<00:02:51.500> of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
they have a very very minimal amount of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.280 
they have a very very minimal amount of
text<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.040> they<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.970> know<00:02:53.060> gmail<00:02:53.600> tasks

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
text here they have you know gmail tasks

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830 
text here they have you know gmail tasks
male<00:02:55.010> chin<00:02:55.280> dropbox<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:56.540> then<00:02:56.660> other<00:02:56.750> than

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
male chin dropbox but then other than

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.590 
male chin dropbox but then other than
that<00:02:57.110> it's<00:02:57.770> really<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.370> all<00:02:58.550> charts<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.209> it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
that it's really it's all charts and it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.110 
that it's really it's all charts and it
really<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.020> very<00:03:00.350> very<00:03:00.620> strong<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.400> easy<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
really it's very very strong and easy to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.300 
really it's very very strong and easy to
understand<00:03:02.660> overview<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.530> what's<00:03:03.800> going<00:03:04.040> on

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
understand overview of what's going on

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.770 
understand overview of what's going on
and<00:03:04.490> i<00:03:04.850> thought<00:03:05.030> they<00:03:05.150> did<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.360> really<00:03:05.390> really

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
and i thought they did a really really

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.020 
and i thought they did a really really
good<00:03:06.050> job<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.709> illustrating<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.110> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
good job of illustrating just that and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.250 
good job of illustrating just that and
this<00:03:11.030> idea<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.950> less<00:03:12.950> text<00:03:13.490> more<00:03:14.260> graphics

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
this idea of less text more graphics

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.600 
this idea of less text more graphics
more<00:03:15.820> charts<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.390> case<00:03:18.160> more<00:03:19.160> engaging

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
more charts in this case more engaging

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.030 
more charts in this case more engaging
things<00:03:20.060> because<00:03:20.390> text<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.989> only<00:03:21.290> engaging<00:03:21.739> to

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
things because text is only engaging to

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.070 
things because text is only engaging to
a<00:03:22.070> certain<00:03:22.430> point<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.660> make<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.930> look

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
a certain point you can make it look

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.110 
a certain point you can make it look
however<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.440> want<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:24.830> it's<00:03:25.550> only<00:03:25.760> engaging

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
however you want but it's only engaging

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720 
however you want but it's only engaging
to<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> certain<00:03:26.720> point<00:03:26.900> because<00:03:27.290> again<00:03:28.160> that's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
to a certain point because again that's

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.580 
to a certain point because again that's
saying<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.390> picture<00:03:30.280> speaks<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.610> thousand<00:03:32.269> words

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
saying a picture speaks a thousand words

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.040 
saying a picture speaks a thousand words
well<00:03:33.590> text<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.160> only<00:03:34.310> speak<00:03:34.670> what<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:34.970> say<00:03:35.390> so

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
well text can only speak what you say so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.620 
well text can only speak what you say so
it's<00:03:36.769> engaging<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.550> does<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.850> job<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:38.330> only

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's engaging it does the job but only

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.509 
it's engaging it does the job but only
to<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.810> certain<00:03:39.019> point<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:40.070> i<00:03:40.100> just<00:03:40.280> want<00:03:40.459> to
