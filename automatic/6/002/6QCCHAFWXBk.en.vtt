the eggs always has massive importance

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660 
the eggs always has massive importance
it's<00:02:47.380> given<00:02:47.650> him<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.889> opportunity<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.430> be

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's given him the opportunity to be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.940 
it's given him the opportunity to be
where<00:02:49.120> he<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.239> today<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:50.079> he<00:02:50.410> was<00:02:50.530> always<00:02:50.680> told

playing that's the rugby villain so
laughter<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.150> hugely<00:03:02.019> important<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:02.709> in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
laughter it's hugely important that's in

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.180 
laughter it's hugely important that's in
this<00:03:03.040> country

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.710 

today<00:03:07.190> we've<00:03:07.370> brought<00:03:07.520> together<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.239> four

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
today we've brought together the four

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.800 
today we've brought together the four
regions<00:03:09.110> which<00:03:09.349> we've<00:03:10.150> established<00:03:11.150> over<00:03:11.630> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
regions which we've established over the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.729 
regions which we've established over the
last<00:03:11.959> four<00:03:12.260> years<00:03:13.630> basically<00:03:14.630> at<00:03:14.989> its<00:03:15.470> groups

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
last four years basically at its groups

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.110

basically<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.360> screen<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.200> boys<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.790> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
basically to screen the boys for the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.240 
basically to screen the boys for the
what<00:03:23.390> eventually<00:03:23.660> become<00:03:24.110> our<00:03:24.230> festival<00:03:25.160> at

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
what eventually become our festival at

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.830 
what eventually become our festival at
Stowe<00:03:25.520> where<00:03:25.760> we'll<00:03:25.910> select<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.300> boys<00:03:26.450> three

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
Stowe where we'll select the boys three

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.509 
Stowe where we'll select the boys three
for<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.580> interpret<00:03:28.780> selections<00:03:30.519> pathway

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
for the interpret selections pathway

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.160 
for the interpret selections pathway
starts<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.239> regional<00:03:32.630> level<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.080> then

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
starts at the regional level and then

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.170 
starts at the regional level and then
works<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.680> where<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.760> festival

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
works up where we have this festival

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.670 
works up where we have this festival
bringing<00:03:35.540> together<00:03:35.660> all<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.170> boys<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.410> this

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
bringing together all the boys in this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.559 
bringing together all the boys in this
research<00:03:36.920> who<00:03:37.160> selected<00:03:37.610> out<00:03:37.730> those<00:03:37.970> regions

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
research who selected out those regions

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.710 
research who selected out those regions
eventually<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> pathway<00:03:40.540> where<00:03:41.540> they

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
eventually in the pathway where they

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.570 
eventually in the pathway where they
will<00:03:41.840> get<00:03:41.959> into<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.290> end<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.530> proof<00:03:42.739> sites<00:03:43.069> at

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
will get into the end of proof sites at

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.559 
will get into the end of proof sites at
the<00:03:44.200> 1519<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.340> 20s<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.519> then<00:03:46.640> hopefully<00:03:46.850> we

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
the 1519 and 20s and then hopefully we

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.820 
the 1519 and 20s and then hopefully we
hope<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> pathway<00:03:48.260> leading<00:03:48.530> through

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
hope the pathway leading through

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.590 
hope the pathway leading through
international

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.990 

as<00:03:52.320> crucial<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.160> volunteers<00:03:53.730> involved

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
as crucial to have volunteers involved
