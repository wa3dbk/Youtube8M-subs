00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so if that gives you an idea of how how

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.050 
so if that gives you an idea of how how
the<00:01:20.280> sound<00:01:21.149> picks<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:22.039> as<00:01:23.039> far<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.250> clothes<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the sound picks up as far as clothes I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.910 
the sound picks up as far as clothes I
haven't<00:01:24.660> heard<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.899> yet<00:01:25.050> but<00:01:25.289> I<00:01:25.440> am<00:01:25.679> guessing

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
haven't heard it yet but I am guessing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.370 
haven't heard it yet but I am guessing
the<00:01:26.280> level<00:01:26.550> ear<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.819> pick<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.149> better<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:28.020> far

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the level ear will pick up better as far

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.900 
the level ear will pick up better as far
as<00:01:28.440> close<00:01:29.069> proximity<00:01:29.869> distance<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.910> betting

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
as close proximity distance I'm betting

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.400 
as close proximity distance I'm betting
on<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.209> one<00:01:33.450> again<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.899> haven't<00:01:34.050> heard<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
on this one again I haven't heard this

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.870 
on this one again I haven't heard this
but<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.979> guys<00:01:35.099> will<00:01:35.280> hear<00:01:35.429> at<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.580> same<00:01:35.700> time

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
but you guys will hear at the same time

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.830 
but you guys will hear at the same time
I<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.920> let's<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.039> started<00:01:38.340> alright<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.420> said

mic the vid pro mic so I'm looking at
the<00:02:34.170> bars<00:02:34.349> right<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.950> course<00:02:35.129> they're

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the bars right now and of course they're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160 
the bars right now and of course they're
jumping<00:02:35.640> normal<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.629> know<00:02:36.720> doing<00:02:37.049> what

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
jumping normal you know doing what

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.809 
jumping normal you know doing what
they're<00:02:37.319> supposed<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.760> is

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
they're supposed to do and this is

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.789 
they're supposed to do and this is
actually<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.420> mic<00:02:39.599> that<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.900> normally<00:02:40.290> use<00:02:40.349> on

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
actually the mic that I normally use on

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.429 
actually the mic that I normally use on
the<00:02:41.189> videos<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:41.879> I<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.780> way<00:02:43.379> you

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
the videos that I make so that way you

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.050 
the videos that I make so that way you
can<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.799> kind<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.340> rough<00:02:44.609> idea<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:44.970> how

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
can get a kind of a rough idea of how

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.709 
can get a kind of a rough idea of how
they<00:02:45.239> compare

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:45.719 
they compare

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.349 
they compare
