00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
easy to change these together all you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.339 
easy to change these together all you
need<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.819> centralized<00:02:46.690> line<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.200> just

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
need is a centralized line that just

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.199 
need is a centralized line that just
runs<00:02:47.530> into<00:02:47.829> each<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.190> Manas<00:02:48.430> tables<00:02:48.790> so

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
runs into each of the Manas tables so

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.640 
runs into each of the Manas tables so
you<00:02:49.269> have<00:02:49.420> one<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.780> runs<00:02:49.930> into<00:02:50.260> each<00:02:50.379> of<00:02:50.530> them

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
you have one that runs into each of them

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.280 
you have one that runs into each of them
for<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.370> brings<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.730> out<00:02:51.849> and<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.870> one<00:02:53.170> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
for what brings it out and then one that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.630 
for what brings it out and then one that
retracts<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.799> back<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.129> puts<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.459> all<00:02:54.519> back

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
retracts it back and puts it all back

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.630 
retracts it back and puts it all back
together<00:02:54.760> which<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.359> me<00:02:55.599> red<00:02:55.780> line<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.170> here

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
together which is me red line in here

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.710 
together which is me red line in here
really<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:57.970> simple<00:02:58.299> all<00:02:58.329> you're<00:02:58.480> gonna<00:02:58.569> do

really really simple all you're gonna do

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.479 
really really simple all you're gonna do
is<00:02:58.810> chain<00:02:59.019> them<00:02:59.170> off<00:02:59.260> each<00:02:59.379> other<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
is chain them off each other it's that

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:00.839 
is chain them off each other it's that
easy

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
easy

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.550 
easy
another<00:03:01.420> quick<00:03:01.599> thing<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.900> note<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.319> this

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
another quick thing to note is this

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.670 
another quick thing to note is this
actually<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.190> practical<00:03:04.410> don't<00:03:05.410> know<00:03:05.470> weird

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
actually is practical don't know weird

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.729 
actually is practical don't know weird
right<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.489> we<00:03:06.609> can<00:03:06.730> see<00:03:06.790> BL<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.590> next

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
right so as we can see BL which is next

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.920 
right so as we can see BL which is next
to<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.950> teen<00:03:09.099> says<00:03:09.340> jungle<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:10.450> never<00:03:10.660> goes

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
to the teen says jungle it never goes

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.559 
to the teen says jungle it never goes
below<00:03:11.349> eight<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.849> completely<00:03:13.239> safe

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
below eight so this is completely safe

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.720 
below eight so this is completely safe
for<00:03:14.019> hostile<00:03:14.620> mobs<00:03:14.799> warning<00:03:15.129> and<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.519> won't

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
for hostile mobs warning and you won't

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.000 
for hostile mobs warning and you won't
get<00:03:15.790> any<00:03:15.849> spawns<00:03:16.389> on<00:03:16.480> this<00:03:16.630> grass<00:03:16.810> tear<00:03:17.049> so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
get any spawns on this grass tear so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.940 
get any spawns on this grass tear so
works<00:03:18.760> quite<00:03:18.970> well<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:20.019> grass<00:03:20.319> will<00:03:20.530> never<00:03:20.709> die

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
works quite well so grass will never die

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.140 
works quite well so grass will never die
in<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.220> machine<00:03:21.400> because<00:03:21.819> when<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.060> gets

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
in this machine because when it gets

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.849 
in this machine because when it gets
pulled<00:03:22.450> down<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.019> gets<00:03:23.200> put<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.650> block

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
pulled down and gets put on this block

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.759 
pulled down and gets put on this block
down<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:25.480> way<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.230> will<00:03:26.349> never<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.709> to

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
down here that way it will never have to

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.009 
down here that way it will never have to
walk<00:03:27.040> directly<00:03:27.250> above<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:28.780> way<00:03:28.870> the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
walk directly above it that way the

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.360 
walk directly above it that way the
grass<00:03:29.169> will<00:03:29.319> never<00:03:29.440> die<00:03:29.650> on<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.099> then<00:03:30.280> when

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
grass will never die on it and then when

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.339 
grass will never die on it and then when
I<00:03:30.400> get<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.609> pull<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:30.880> out<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.299> always<00:03:31.450> fresh

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
I get to pull back out it's always fresh

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.780 
I get to pull back out it's always fresh
grass<00:03:32.980> not<00:03:33.540> horrible

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
grass not horrible

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.400 
grass not horrible
so<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:37.060> other<00:03:37.209> thing<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:37.540> mention<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.959> this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
so one other thing to mention is this

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.520 
so one other thing to mention is this
pop-up<00:03:38.680> light<00:03:39.010> post<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:40.239> also<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> hipster<00:03:41.139> door

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
pop-up light post is also a hipster door

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.170 
pop-up light post is also a hipster door
that's<00:03:41.709> why<00:03:41.889> then<00:03:42.099> word<00:03:42.400> hipsters<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> its

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
that's why then word hipsters in its

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.479 
that's why then word hipsters in its
name<00:03:43.419> so<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.989> get<00:03:44.109> this<00:03:44.200> button<00:03:44.620> we<00:03:45.370> can

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
name so if I get this button we can

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.150 
name so if I get this button we can
actually<00:03:45.940> form<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.299> completely<00:03:46.720> glass<00:03:47.169> wall<00:03:47.500> so

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
actually form a completely glass wall so

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.940 
actually form a completely glass wall so
at<00:03:48.489> first<00:03:48.760> glance<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.569> this<00:03:50.290> would<00:03:50.500> seem<00:03:50.829> to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
at first glance this this would seem to

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.440 
at first glance this this would seem to
not<00:03:51.160> be<00:03:51.340> able<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.609> be<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.730> door<00:03:51.970> at<00:03:52.090> all<00:03:52.180> because

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
