00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.729 
his way he would have gone home on the
tram<00:03:16.640> with<00:03:16.879> it<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.659> he<00:03:17.750> would<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.080> loved<00:03:18.319> it

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
tram with it and he would have loved it

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.610 
tram with it and he would have loved it
others<00:03:19.670> wouldn't<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:22.970> say<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
others wouldn't I can say that the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.649 
others wouldn't I can say that the
second<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.099> was<00:03:25.250> able<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.670> take<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.180> nappy<00:03:26.510> off

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
second I was able to take that nappy off

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.869 
second I was able to take that nappy off
I<00:03:26.959> took<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.500> off<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.650> did<00:03:27.950> not<00:03:28.099> put<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.430> back<00:03:28.640> on

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
I took it off and did not put it back on

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.960 
I took it off and did not put it back on
again<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.530> hopefully<00:03:31.370> don't<00:03:31.489> plan<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
again and hopefully don't plan to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.460 
again and hopefully don't plan to
because<00:03:32.209> they're<00:03:32.360> actually<00:03:32.750> adult<00:03:33.049> nappies

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
because they're actually adult nappies

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.440 
because they're actually adult nappies
and<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.799> really<00:03:34.400> don't<00:03:34.579> ever<00:03:34.910> want<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.239> get<00:03:35.329> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
and I really don't ever want to get to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.699 
and I really don't ever want to get to
the<00:03:35.540> point<00:03:35.720> where<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.870> can't<00:03:36.079> control<00:03:36.379> my<00:03:36.590> own

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the point where I can't control my own

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.849 
the point where I can't control my own
barrel<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.720> no<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.750> threw<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.500> bin<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
barrel so no I threw that in the bin and

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.410 
barrel so no I threw that in the bin and
sort<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.459> hopes<00:03:40.609> that<00:03:40.700> I'd<00:03:40.849> never<00:03:41.000> see<00:03:41.269> one

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
sort of hopes that I'd never see one

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.629 
sort of hopes that I'd never see one
again
