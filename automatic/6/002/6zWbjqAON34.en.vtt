00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
and at these great Heights we would

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.990 
and at these great Heights we would
expect<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:32.010> wouldn't<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.700> very<00:02:32.820> much

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
expect that it wouldn't have very much

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.430 
expect that it wouldn't have very much
pressure<00:02:33.329> left<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.019> leaves<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:34.380> be

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
pressure left and so the leaves would be

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
pressure left and so the leaves would be
reduced<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.100> implication<00:02:35.609> would<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.760> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
reduced the implication would be that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.830 
reduced the implication would be that
this<00:02:36.750> tree<00:02:36.959> has<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.109> long<00:02:37.320> ways<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.769> could<00:02:37.920> go<00:02:38.840> so

this tree has a long ways it could go so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
workings of the world's tallest tree I'm
amazed<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.220> amazed<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> never<00:02:50.820> would
