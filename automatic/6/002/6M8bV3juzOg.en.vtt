 of the water that darkens it's time 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.529
 our light joins many more

 children of the village do the same and 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.770
 our lake wakes up with hundreds of

 floating stars today our voices 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.190

 many things we all know very 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 well we gather around you and 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.449
 we listen to what you have to say 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 our eyes are directed to the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.620
 immensity of the universe 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.610
 at night is when we can see the lights 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 in the dark 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.640
 millions and millions of suns moons and 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:21.049
 planets if we were far away from 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.860
 here and in some other galaxy the planet 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.920
 Earth would seem so tiny that he would never 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.659
 we would know about the extraordinary magic that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.020
 encloses 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.159
 a magic that appeared not long ago 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.819
 time and we have called final 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 how life began is a mystery to 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:51.780
 we nevertheless appeared survived 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:56.630
 and evolved bright colors and shapes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.350
 strangers began to spring up suddenly 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.820
 this happened on earth because our 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:09.780
 planet has a mysterious don the water 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.410
 water is life is constantly being 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 transforming and moving is transformed 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.750
 of ice on the mountain peaks to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.410
 fresh and crystalline currents in the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.140
 rivers where cold raindrops to 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.450
 green leaves of the plants are 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.360
 transforms sweet fruits of the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 trees to the blood and cipal provides in 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.450
 our bodies the water moves and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.690
 dance tour all the time 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.110
 our entire existence depends on water 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.510
 we have always looked for our 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.870
 Most sacred ceremonies are made with 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.379
 Water 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.650
 we have protected it from arrived and we have 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.010
 prayed to have it 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.640
 and we have traveled long distances to 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.490
 find her 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.790
 and we have established our towns and 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.040
 great civilizations near rivers and 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.750
 lakes we need water to 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.750
 absolutely everything we do 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.510
 however we use too much water a lot 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.640
 more than we really need the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.810
 we harm by contaminating it with our 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.330
 trash many water uses have been 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.380
 contaminated many animals no longer 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.310
 they have access to clean water water 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.060
 drinking has become scarce without water not 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.480
 we can survive 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.599
 our planet offers enough water 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.870
 for everyone but we need our 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.480
 human gifts we need our 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.180
 will and our compassion for 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.040
 work together to choose wisely 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.010
 we need our imagination so that 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.130
 come up with solutions so that the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.269
 good ideas become actions for 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.780
 preserve and properly distribute the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.780
 Water 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.280
 after saying all this we go back to 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.980
 lake the candles are still shining we form 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.350
 a human barrier we unite as 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.160
 soldiers to protect our source of 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.280
 life the next morning the dust 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.580
 whole wakes up we dedicate the day to 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 pick up the extinguished candles our lake 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.450
 it is clean shining with its beautiful 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 blue each one of us has made his 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 I work every little thing we do 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.350
 has a positive impact on our 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.229
 planet 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.889
 we can choose to respect the world and not 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.889
 destroy 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.100
 on earth and that little blue dot 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.919
 it will keep turning and turning and we 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.449
 we will continue spinning in it triumphing in 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.279
 the mission of taking care of water 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:16.889
 the water will continue to move dancing 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:20.099
 transforming itself making the magic sprout 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.360
 of the world the magic that belongs to us 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.360
 only us 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.540
 your mind is bright your heart is 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.830
 wise now you think you can do 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.830
 to protect the planet's water 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.169
 cabbage 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.169
 Y
