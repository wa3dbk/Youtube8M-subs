my reaction animation overall is very
solid<00:00:58.109> typical<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.770> mid<00:00:59.070> 90s<00:00:59.489> sunrise<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:01.079> a

lot of care taken to just make the shots
look<00:01:05.010> atmospheric<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
look atmospheric and things like that

there<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.500> some<00:01:08.310> episodes<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
there are some some episodes that have a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
there are some some episodes that have a
lower<00:01:09.510> sheet<00:01:09.840> count<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.290> others<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
lower sheet count than others and just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
lower sheet count than others and just
don't<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.909> nice<00:01:12.450> animation

episodes with a lot of reused animation
jeez<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.040> better<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.509> shows

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
jeez but better that then there shows

jeez but better that then there shows
its<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.500> consistent<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
its but it's pretty consistent all the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.190 
its but it's pretty consistent all the
way<00:01:23.100> throughout<00:01:23.369> there's<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:23.970> stuff

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
way throughout there's some good stuff

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.480 
way throughout there's some good stuff
pretty<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> way<00:01:25.650> through<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
pretty much all the way through and the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
pretty much all the way through and the
ending<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.060> well<00:01:27.330> animated<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:28.049> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.570 
acting I listened to the Japanese dub
just<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.440> Gundam<00:02:55.440> English<00:02:55.830> dubs<00:02:56.100> tend<00:02:56.430> to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
just because Gundam English dubs tend to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610 
just because Gundam English dubs tend to
be<00:02:56.790> fairly<00:02:57.240> middle<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> line<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> mean

it'll<00:02:58.890> be<00:02:59.010> some<00:02:59.250> good<00:03:00.150> work<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.540> some<00:03:00.660> not<00:03:00.810> so

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
it'll be some good work and some not so

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.600

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
actually works very well until about

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.840 
actually works very well until about
episode<00:03:45.600> 12<00:03:46.019> 2<00:03:46.230> episode<00:03:46.500> 24<00:03:47.130> there's<00:03:47.760> this

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
antagonists if you will and I just I

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.600 
antagonists if you will and I just I
started<00:03:58.350> getting<00:03:58.650> tired<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.540> plot<00:04:00.870> line

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
started getting tired of that plot line

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.430 
started getting tired of that plot line
ironically<00:04:02.610> because<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.390> really<00:04:03.840> generally

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
ironically because I really generally

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.890 
ironically because I really generally
like<00:04:04.620> big<00:04:04.980> long<00:04:05.190> story<00:04:05.580> arcs<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.420> me<00:04:06.570> G<00:04:06.780> Gundam

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
like big long story arcs for me G Gundam

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.140 
like big long story arcs for me G Gundam
was<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.350> structured<00:04:07.920> much<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:08.820> was

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
was just structured much we was

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.880 
was just structured much we was
structured<00:04:09.540> for<00:04:09.810> these<00:04:09.989> one-on-one<00:04:10.620> duels

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
structured for these one-on-one duels

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.390 
structured for these one-on-one duels
and<00:04:11.720> when<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.810> got<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.140> big<00:04:13.440> long<00:04:13.680> thing<00:04:14.070> for

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
and when you got this big long thing for

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400 
and when you got this big long thing for
me<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.519> just<00:04:14.760> lost<00:04:15.000> interest<00:04:15.360> I'm<00:04:15.780> sorry<00:04:16.080> but

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
me I just lost interest I'm sorry but

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.440 
me I just lost interest I'm sorry but
when<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.160> halfway<00:04:17.459> mark<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.330> way

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
when you halfway mark and all the way

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.840 
when you halfway mark and all the way
through<00:04:18.750> till<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> end<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.650> was<00:04:19.919> there<00:04:20.519> all<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
through till the end I was there all the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.700 
through till the end I was there all the
way<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.359> enjoying<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.900> thoroughly<00:04:22.109> it's<00:04:22.560> just

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
way and enjoying it thoroughly it's just

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.710 
way and enjoying it thoroughly it's just
you<00:04:23.160> know<00:04:23.220> again<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.240> structure<00:04:24.690> just

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
you know again that structure just

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.420 
you know again that structure just
really<00:04:25.050> works<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.500> show<00:04:25.710> partly

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
really works for this show partly

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.340 
really works for this show partly
because

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
because

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.520 
because
characters<00:04:27.740> are<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:27.920> one<00:04:28.520> for<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:29.570> note<00:04:29.870> or

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
characters are so one for one note or

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.300 
characters are so one for one note or
maybe<00:04:30.770> two<00:04:31.010> notes<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:32.860> focusing<00:04:33.860> on<00:04:34.040> just

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
maybe two notes that focusing on just

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.620 
maybe two notes that focusing on just
one<00:04:34.520> or<00:04:34.610> two<00:04:34.640> characters<00:04:35.000> at<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.120> time<00:04:35.150> actually

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
one or two characters at a time actually

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.900 
one or two characters at a time actually
really<00:04:36.020> helps<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.160> don't<00:04:37.550> really<00:04:37.730> want<00:04:37.850> to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
really helps I don't really want to

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.330 
really helps I don't really want to
spend<00:04:38.120> 12<00:04:38.510> episodes<00:04:38.840> with<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.230> same<00:04:39.470> three

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
spend 12 episodes with the same three

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.920 
spend 12 episodes with the same three
characters<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.150> want<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.840> sort<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:43.690> mix<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.810> up

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
characters I want to sort of mix it up

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.390 
characters I want to sort of mix it up
so<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.260> get<00:04:45.500> little<00:04:45.710> bits<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:45.980> pieces<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.340> this

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
so I get little bits and pieces of this

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.220 
so I get little bits and pieces of this
caption<00:04:46.670> oh<00:04:46.790> this<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.360> interesting<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.050> was

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
caption oh this is interesting and I was

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.120 
caption oh this is interesting and I was
interesting<00:04:48.590> about<00:04:48.680> that<00:04:48.860> character<00:04:49.540> it<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.750> a

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
interesting about that character it is a

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.410 
interesting about that character it is a
it<00:04:52.130> does<00:04:52.310> stay<00:04:52.490> consistent<00:04:52.940> within<00:04:53.060> its<00:04:53.210> world

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
it does stay consistent within its world

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.450 
it does stay consistent within its world
a<00:04:53.570> believability<00:04:53.960> is<00:04:54.440> solid<00:04:55.220> throughout

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
a believability is solid throughout

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.670 
a believability is solid throughout
there<00:04:56.000> are<00:04:56.090> some<00:04:56.300> writing<00:04:56.660> things<00:04:56.930> or<00:04:57.350> some

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
there are some writing things or some

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.050 
there are some writing things or some
plotting<00:04:58.070> things<00:04:58.280> at<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.460> beginning<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:59.030> I

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
plotting things at the beginning that I

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.860 
plotting things at the beginning that I
really<00:04:59.450> didn't<00:04:59.750> buy<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.830> then<00:05:01.630> they<00:05:02.630> later

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
really didn't buy but then they later

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.690 
really didn't buy but then they later
revealed<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:03.620> sure<00:05:03.950> enough<00:05:04.070> there's<00:05:04.460> some

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
revealed that sure enough there's some

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.100 
revealed that sure enough there's some
there<00:05:04.910> were<00:05:05.030> some<00:05:05.210> weirdnesses<00:05:05.660> going<00:05:05.990> on

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
there were some weirdnesses going on

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.510 
there were some weirdnesses going on
there<00:05:06.410> with<00:05:06.680> what<00:05:06.830> keep<00:05:07.040> our<00:05:07.190> focus<00:05:07.310> were

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
there with what keep our focus were

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.410 
there with what keep our focus were
doing<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.330> was<00:05:08.960> actually<00:05:10.420> thoroughly

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
doing so I was actually thoroughly

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.050 
doing so I was actually thoroughly
satisfied<00:05:11.990> with<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.770> plot<00:05:13.040> by<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.640> end<00:05:13.940> of

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
satisfied with the plot by the end of

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.640 
satisfied with the plot by the end of
the<00:05:14.540> show<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.870> once<00:05:15.050> everything<00:05:15.410> sort<00:05:15.620> of

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
the show and once everything sort of

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.800 
the show and once everything sort of
came<00:05:15.860> together<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.460> think<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.270> was<00:05:17.360> just<00:05:17.420> very

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
came together I think it was just very

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.790 
came together I think it was just very
solidly<00:05:18.200> written<00:05:18.650> in<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:18.980> just<00:05:20.380> you<00:05:21.380> know<00:05:21.440> it

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
solidly written in and just you know it
