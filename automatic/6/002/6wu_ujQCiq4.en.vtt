00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello in this video I'll explain 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.320
 how is this necklace using insurance for 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 this is being chirped that all the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
 I bought it in hobie I see it but 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 I grabbed everything at half the price 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.819
 then for this one pay a dollar 50 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.029
 cents and for this is pay a dollar and 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:27.089
 I already had the insurance what 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.989
 I started was to put the insurance I saw that 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:33.929
 I could put 6 balls of this size 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:37.469
 to every sure then what am I 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:40.109
 following is a pattern I started using 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.649
 the color he wanted and to make it 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:47.510
 a zig zag first I put a rose 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.289
 once another rosita and three of the same 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.710
 Then what I did was put a 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.950
 dark the 3 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.260
 the rosita the beige and the other rosita 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.500
 they will always go together then what 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.300
 was doing here was to decrease 3 2 and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.259
 then 1 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.290
 look 3 2 1 and what 3 then 1 2 3 and so 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.020
 successively and I went doing this 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.409
 necklace I do not know if I'm going to put it more 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.109
 sure or until I'll leave it there 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.450
 so while I closed it I closed it 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.210
 with these you can use any 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.579
 chain that they no longer use the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.759
 cut and bend around here and 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.490
 closes and puts the brooch and or 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.820
 I did and look how it looks looks very nice 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 I hope you like this now 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.409

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.220
 look how it looks and this is the size of the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.700
 sure because there are different sizes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.370
