some<00:02:29.810> G<00:02:30.810> slopes

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
some G slopes

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.340 
some G slopes
yeah<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.459> slopes<00:02:32.850> right<00:02:33.030> here<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.840> got<00:02:34.170> some

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
yeah the slopes right here also got some

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.740 
yeah the slopes right here also got some
clear<00:02:34.709> ones<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.489> some<00:02:35.609> other<00:02:35.760> clear<00:02:36.090> pieces

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
clear ones and some other clear pieces

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.259 
clear ones and some other clear pieces
inside<00:02:37.170> basically<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.829> get<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:39.030> wheel

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
inside basically you get two wheel

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.190 
inside basically you get two wheel
holders<00:02:39.750> for<00:02:40.340> round

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
holders for round

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
holders for round
skite<00:02:43.200> studs<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.069> wheels<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:45.000> 2

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
skite studs for the wheels you have a 2

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
skite studs for the wheels you have a 2
by<00:02:45.480> 2<00:02:45.630> plate<00:02:46.819> it's<00:02:47.819> light<00:02:48.060> gray<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:50.340> that

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
by 2 plate it's light gray is that

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.150 
by 2 plate it's light gray is that
what's<00:02:50.880> under<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.150> 1<00:02:51.569> by<00:02:51.750> 2<00:02:51.810> slope<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
what's under that 1 by 2 slope there I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.580 
what's under that 1 by 2 slope there I
mean<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.030> slope<00:02:54.359> 1<00:02:54.630> by<00:02:54.780> 2<00:02:56.090> tile<00:02:57.590> there's

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
mean that slope 1 by 2 tile there's

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.270 
mean that slope 1 by 2 tile there's
another<00:02:58.859> 1<00:02:59.190> by<00:02:59.310> 2<00:02:59.340> clear<00:02:59.850> piece<00:03:00.090> no<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.250> ok

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
another 1 by 2 clear piece no it's ok

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.150 
another 1 by 2 clear piece no it's ok
you<00:03:02.819> see<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.329> here<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.859> really

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
you see what we here do here is really

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.220 
you see what we here do here is really
not<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.340> lot<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.519> pieces<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.930> your

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
not a lot of pieces to it that is your

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.289 
not a lot of pieces to it that is your

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.360 
meaning delorean microscale DeLorean and
in<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:13.049> different<00:03:13.230> video<00:03:13.560> show<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.130> how<00:03:14.310> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
in a different video show you how to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:24.660 
in a different video show you how to
build<00:03:14.639> that<00:03:15.590> okay

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:36.670 

you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.179 

we<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.920> what<00:03:38.430> also<00:03:38.580> have<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:39.030> hot<00:03:39.269> wheels

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
we have what also have the hot wheels

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.289 
we have what also have the hot wheels
DeLorean<00:03:41.189> this<00:03:41.430> isn't<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.849> Back<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.209> Future

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
DeLorean this isn't a Back to the Future

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.420 
DeLorean this isn't a Back to the Future
one<00:03:42.750> boat<00:03:42.959> we<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.470> got<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.769> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.040> similar

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
one boat we just got it kind of similar

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.399 
one boat we just got it kind of similar
to<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.819> between<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.750> back<00:03:45.930> part<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.319> it

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
to it between the back part of it

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.059 
to it between the back part of it
doesn't<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.769> all<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.010> design<00:03:47.370> gets<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.090> black

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
doesn't have all the design gets a black

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.089 
doesn't have all the design gets a black
and<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.849> looks<00:03:51.269> like<00:03:51.689> a<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:52.470> warriors<00:03:52.890> l

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
and it looks like a little warriors l

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.850 
and it looks like a little warriors l
any<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.030> techniques<00:03:54.780> itself<00:03:55.530> it's<00:03:55.739> very

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
any of the techniques itself it's very

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.420 
any of the techniques itself it's very
cool<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:57.420> good<00:03:57.799> you<00:03:58.799> know<00:03:58.980> he<00:03:59.159> has<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
cool very good you know he has the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
cool very good you know he has the
actual<00:03:59.879> Back<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.720> Future<00:04:00.810> DeLorean<00:04:02.450> it's

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
actual Back to the Future DeLorean it's

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.399 
actual Back to the Future DeLorean it's
cool

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
cool

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.670 
cool
and<00:04:04.939> you<00:04:05.939> can<00:04:06.239> now<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.599> has<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> back<00:04:07.109> detail

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
and you can now it has a back detail

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.470 
and you can now it has a back detail
details<00:04:09.829> on<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.099> inside<00:04:11.519> still<00:04:11.909> have<00:04:12.090> flux

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
details on the inside still have flux

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.890 
details on the inside still have flux
capacitor<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.170> that's<00:04:13.349> super<00:04:13.590> hard<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.099> see

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
capacitor but that's super hard to see

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:25.000 
capacitor but that's super hard to see
yeah

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.120

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
again we like Lego kuso DeLorean Setzer

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.750 
again we like Lego kuso DeLorean Setzer
