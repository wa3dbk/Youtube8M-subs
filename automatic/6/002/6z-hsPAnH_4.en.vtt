think on the website it says it's like a

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
think on the website it says it's like a
4b<00:00:40.190> 4c<00:00:41.719> type<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.140> texture<00:00:44.040> okay<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.059> hair

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
4b 4c type of texture okay so the hair

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.209 
4b 4c type of texture okay so the hair
did<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.539> come<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.320> colored<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
did not come like this I colored it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.959 
did not come like this I colored it
myself<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.820> hair<00:00:47.969> came<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> standard<00:00:49.969> 1b

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
myself the hair came in the standard 1b

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
myself the hair came in the standard 1b
color<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.379> wouldn't<00:00:52.590> even<00:00:52.649> say<00:00:52.800> it's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
color actually I wouldn't even say it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
color actually I wouldn't even say it's
a<00:00:53.190> 1b<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> reminds<00:00:54.930> me<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> heat<00:00:55.320> free

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
a 1b it kind of reminds me of heat free

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.290 
a 1b it kind of reminds me of heat free
here<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> sense<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.640> color<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.239> more

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
here in the sense that the color is more

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
here in the sense that the color is more
of<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.430> brownish<00:00:59.430> color<00:00:59.460> than<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.379> mix<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.649> black

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of a brownish color than a mix of black

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.490 
of a brownish color than a mix of black
and<00:01:02.609> brown<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.180> makes<00:01:03.420> sense<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and brown that makes sense where it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
and brown that makes sense where it
looks<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> don't<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.820> think

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
looks like well I don't even think

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730 
looks like well I don't even think
you'll<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> able<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.439> might

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you'll be able to see actually you might

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.390 
you'll be able to see actually you might
like<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.479> hair<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.290> dark<00:01:10.799> right

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
like you see how my hair is dark right

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
like you see how my hair is dark right
here<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> hair<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.240> big<00:01:15.240> chop<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
here and the hair the big chop here is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
here and the hair the big chop here is
kind<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> brown<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:17.759> again<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.119> fades

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
kind of brown but then again it fades

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
kind of brown but then again it fades
into<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> blonde<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> guess<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:19.710> like

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
into the blonde so I guess it looks like

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
into the blonde so I guess it looks like
I've<00:01:21.080> grown<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I've grown it out now I'm not going to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.660 
I've grown it out now I'm not going to
go<00:01:24.869> into<00:01:25.200> full<00:01:25.439> detail<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
go into full detail because this is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.170 
go into full detail because this is
actually<00:01:27.119> my<00:01:27.390> second<00:01:28.400> day<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> hair<00:01:29.970> in

much<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.240> paid<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.780> because<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.680> bought<00:02:18.980> this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
much I paid for it because I bought this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.010 
much I paid for it because I bought this
hair<00:02:20.170> back<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.380> July<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:23.060> gonna<00:02:23.390> see<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:23.960> I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
hair back in July but I'm gonna see if I

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.380 
hair back in July but I'm gonna see if I
can<00:02:24.170> dig<00:02:24.440> up<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.740> receipt<00:02:25.130> or<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.060> invoice

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
can dig up the receipt or the invoice

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.200 
can dig up the receipt or the invoice
and<00:02:26.750> I'll<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.680> cost<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.700> everything

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.170 
and I'll put the cost of everything
right<00:02:29.720> here<00:02:30.080> okay<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.710> this<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.760> not<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
right here okay so this is not the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.600 
right here okay so this is not the
natural<00:02:32.470> curl<00:02:33.470> pattern<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.160> hair<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.550> is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
natural curl pattern of the hair this is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.150 
natural curl pattern of the hair this is
actually<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.360> twist<00:02:36.140> out<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.500> did<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> hair

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
actually a twist out I did with the hair

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.810 
actually a twist out I did with the hair
just<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.700> see<00:02:37.970> how<00:02:38.900> my<00:02:39.170> hair<00:02:39.200> could<00:02:39.820> better

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
just to see how my hair could better

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.080 
just to see how my hair could better
blend<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.800> did<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.160> yesterday<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
blend with it and I did one yesterday I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.430 
blend with it and I did one yesterday I
should<00:02:44.330> have<00:02:44.420> taken<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.690> picture<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.050> think<00:02:45.320> I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
should have taken a picture I think I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.449 
should have taken a picture I think I
like<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.770> way<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.010> came<00:02:46.040> out<00:02:46.310> yesterday

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
like the way it came out yesterday

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.160 
like the way it came out yesterday
better<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.290> um<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:49.220> used<00:02:49.760> different<00:02:50.660> products

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
better but um I used different products

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.900 
better but um I used different products
today<00:02:51.560> than<00:02:51.800> I<00:02:51.890> did<00:02:51.920> yesterday<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.610> maybe

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
today than I did yesterday so maybe

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.199 
today than I did yesterday so maybe
that's<00:02:53.240> what<00:02:53.630> uh<00:02:54.760> that's<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
that's what uh that's what the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.780 
that's what uh that's what the
difference<00:02:56.390> was<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.709> um<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.160> still<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.580> still

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
difference was but um I still I still

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.190 
difference was but um I still I still
like<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.930> was<00:03:00.020> yesterday

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
like this but the way it was yesterday

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.350 
like this but the way it was yesterday
was<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.770> like<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.160> million<00:03:01.700> times<00:03:01.970> better<00:03:02.150> in

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
was just like a million times better in

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.420 
was just like a million times better in
my<00:03:02.480> opinion<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:03.020> know<00:03:03.320> it's<00:03:03.530> all<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> know<00:03:04.100> when

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
my opinion I know it's all I know when

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.010 
my opinion I know it's all I know when
we<00:03:04.550> have<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.150> two<00:03:05.300> days<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.840> hate

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
we have this in for two days and I hate

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.690 
we have this in for two days and I hate
when<00:03:06.200> people<00:03:06.470> say<00:03:06.620> oh<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:06.860> love<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.340> hair<00:03:07.459> so

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
when people say oh I love this hair so

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.500 
when people say oh I love this hair so
much<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.900> actually<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.340> hair<00:03:10.730> not

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
much but I actually like this hair not

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.020 
much but I actually like this hair not
because<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.380> know<00:03:12.530> oh<00:03:12.920> no<00:03:13.370> shedding<00:03:13.640> or

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
because of you know oh no shedding or

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.970 
because of you know oh no shedding or
tangling<00:03:14.480> none<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.080> stuff<00:03:15.410> because<00:03:15.769> it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
tangling none of that stuff because it

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.910 
tangling none of that stuff because it
does<00:03:16.370> shed<00:03:16.940> because<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:17.600> kinky<00:03:18.410> curly<00:03:18.590> hair

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
does shed because it's kinky curly hair

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.770 
does shed because it's kinky curly hair
and<00:03:19.190> that's<00:03:19.550> actually<00:03:20.030> why<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and that's actually why I like it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.400 
and that's actually why I like it
because<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.410> mimics<00:03:22.310> my<00:03:23.150> actual<00:03:23.780> hair<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.380> a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
because it mimics my actual hair to a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.910 
because it mimics my actual hair to a
tee<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.900> way<00:03:27.019> my<00:03:27.380> hair<00:03:27.709> would

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
tee like this is the way my hair would

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.360 
tee like this is the way my hair would
be<00:03:28.160> if<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:29.030> did<00:03:29.300> twisted<00:03:29.810> all<00:03:29.959> over<00:03:30.380> except<00:03:31.190> this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
be if I did twisted all over except this

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.060 
be if I did twisted all over except this
looks<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.720> fuller<00:03:33.110> than<00:03:33.440> my<00:03:33.620> hair<00:03:33.860> and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
looks a little fuller than my hair and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.240 
looks a little fuller than my hair and
it's<00:03:34.700> longer<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.630> if<00:03:36.350> I<00:03:36.590> were<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.860> grow<00:03:37.070> my<00:03:37.220> hair

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
it's longer so if I were to grow my hair

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.090 
it's longer so if I were to grow my hair
out<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.880> know<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.989> exactly<00:03:39.290> how<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:39.830> would

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
out I know this is exactly how it would

00:03:40.100 --> 00:04:38.060 
out I know this is exactly how it would
look

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.610 

okay<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.400> achieve<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.289> didn't<00:04:41.530> do

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
okay so to achieve this I didn't do

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.570 
okay so to achieve this I didn't do
anything<00:04:42.100> special<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:43.860> separated<00:04:44.860> my<00:04:45.100> hair<00:04:45.370> and

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
anything special I separated my hair and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.159 
anything special I separated my hair and
when<00:04:45.789> in<00:04:45.940> section<00:04:46.300> by<00:04:46.419> section<00:04:46.479> I<00:04:46.990> had

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
when in section by section I had

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.950 
when in section by section I had
saturated<00:04:47.949> one<00:04:48.430> part<00:04:48.699> with<00:04:48.850> water<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:49.930> I

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
saturated one part with water then I

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.070 
saturated one part with water then I
would<00:04:50.380> go<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.830> with<00:04:50.860> my<00:04:51.840> macadamia<00:04:52.840> oil

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
would go in with my macadamia oil

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.969 
would go in with my macadamia oil
conditioner<00:04:53.919> and<00:04:54.160> then<00:04:54.840> brush<00:04:55.840> through<00:04:56.139> with

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
conditioner and then brush through with

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.940 
conditioner and then brush through with
my<00:04:57.130> Denman<00:04:57.460> brush<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.330> noticed<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.960> about

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
my Denman brush and I noticed that about

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.250 
my Denman brush and I noticed that about
I<00:04:59.979> can't<00:05:00.460> even<00:05:00.639> say<00:05:00.789> halfway<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:01.900> quarter

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
I can't even say halfway like a quarter

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.129 
I can't even say halfway like a quarter
of<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.470> way<00:05:02.620> my<00:05:03.520> macadamia<00:05:04.330> oil<00:05:04.539> conditioner

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:45.239 
since this is just nothing but

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.539 
since this is just nothing but
conditioner<00:05:45.899> the<00:05:46.559> hair<00:05:46.769> wasn't<00:05:47.189> going<00:05:47.369> to<00:05:47.459> do

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
how this would react to oil hair like I

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:54.919
