00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
photography show and I've been doing a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.980 
photography show and I've been doing a
few<00:00:16.670> sessions<00:00:16.910> each<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:17.390> every<00:00:17.540> day<00:00:17.720> and<00:00:17.869> it's

few sessions each and every day and it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.120 
few sessions each and every day and it's
been<00:00:18.080> quite<00:00:18.260> interesting<00:00:18.710> at<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.860> end<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
been quite interesting at the end of the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.740 
been quite interesting at the end of the
sessions<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:19.640> people<00:00:20.240> have<00:00:20.360> been<00:00:20.450> coming<00:00:20.660> up

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
sessions that people have been coming up

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.990 
sessions that people have been coming up
asking<00:00:21.170> about<00:00:21.439> this<00:00:22.010> phrase<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:22.340> we<00:00:22.640> use<00:00:22.670> we

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
asking about this phrase that we use we

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.519 
asking about this phrase that we use we
do<00:00:23.119> in<00:00:23.180> researching<00:00:23.689> which<00:00:23.869> is<00:00:24.050> working<00:00:24.260> at

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
do in researching which is working at

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.200 
do in researching which is working at
non-destructively<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:25.670> I<00:00:25.730> thought<00:00:25.970> and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
non-destructively so I thought and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.210 
non-destructively so I thought and
although<00:00:27.170> we're<00:00:27.439> pretty<00:00:27.650> busy<00:00:28.010> here<00:00:28.160> I

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
although we're pretty busy here I

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.499 
although we're pretty busy here I
thought<00:00:28.460> I'd<00:00:28.580> just<00:00:28.700> take<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.910> few<00:00:29.210> months

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
thought I'd just take a few months

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.330 
thought I'd just take a few months
before<00:00:29.660> classes<00:00:30.020> start<00:00:30.380> again<00:00:30.560> just<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:31.130> put

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
before classes start again just to put

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.400 
before classes start again just to put
something<00:00:31.820> nice<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.780> short<00:00:32.930> together<00:00:33.200> to

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
something nice and short together to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.500 
something nice and short together to
give<00:00:33.530> you<00:00:33.620> an<00:00:33.710> idea<00:00:33.770> of<00:00:34.010> what<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.310> mean<00:00:34.670> by

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
give you an idea of what I mean by

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.660 
give you an idea of what I mean by
working<00:00:35.989> non-destructively<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:37.399> I'll<00:00:37.550> just

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
working non-destructively so I'll just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.920 
working non-destructively so I'll just
quickly<00:00:37.790> show<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.120> on<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:38.329> picture<00:00:38.570> here<00:00:38.690> so

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
quickly show you on this picture here so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.420 
quickly show you on this picture here so
this<00:00:39.230> is<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.500> final<00:00:39.980> image<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.340> you'll

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
this is the final image and you'll

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.340 
this is the final image and you'll
notice<00:00:40.790> that<00:00:40.880> this<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.060> actually<00:00:41.510> shown<00:00:42.170> as

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
notice that this is actually shown as

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.229 
notice that this is actually shown as
being<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.770> smart<00:00:43.220> object<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.730> we<00:00:43.850> can<00:00:43.970> see<00:00:44.090> that

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
being a smart object and we can see that

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.790 
being a smart object and we can see that
from<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.570> icon<00:00:44.989> in<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.200> bottom<00:00:45.440> right<00:00:45.770> hand

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
from the icon in the bottom right hand

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.040 
from the icon in the bottom right hand
corner<00:00:46.040> on<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.490> thumbnail<00:00:46.850> now<00:00:47.480> if<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:47.720> just<00:00:47.930> go

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
corner on the thumbnail now if I just go

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.720 
corner on the thumbnail now if I just go
over<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.620> picture<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:49.070> before<00:00:49.520> it's

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
over to the picture here before it's

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.280 
over to the picture here before it's
finished<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.180> can<00:00:50.330> see<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.690> we've<00:00:50.810> got<00:00:50.960> all

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
finished we can see that we've got all

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.350 
finished we can see that we've got all
these<00:00:51.680> layers<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:52.460> go<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.670> make<00:00:52.970> up<00:00:53.150> the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
these layers here that go to make up the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360 
these layers here that go to make up the
image<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.870> now<00:00:54.440> I'm<00:00:54.560> kind<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.920> at<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.100> stage

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
image and now I'm kind of at the stage

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.700 
image and now I'm kind of at the stage
here<00:00:55.820> where<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.210> want<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.660> just<00:00:56.810> do<00:00:56.960> some<00:00:57.200> final

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
here where I want to just do some final

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.620 
here where I want to just do some final
finishing<00:00:58.010> touches<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.790> want<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.270> go<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.510> may

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
finishing touches I want to go and may

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.170 
finishing touches I want to go and may
be<00:00:59.690> used<00:01:00.050> like<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.290> plugin<00:01:00.680> like<00:01:01.010> Google's<00:01:01.850> Nick

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
be used like a plugin like Google's Nick

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.840 
be used like a plugin like Google's Nick
Kerr<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:03.170> X<00:01:03.350> Pro<00:01:03.650> 4<00:01:04.040> or<00:01:04.250> something<00:01:04.400> like<00:01:04.640> that

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
Kerr if X Pro 4 or something like that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850 
Kerr if X Pro 4 or something like that
so<00:01:05.089> ordinarily<00:01:05.900> positon<00:01:06.470> works<00:01:06.619> something

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
so ordinarily positon works something

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.350 
so ordinarily positon works something
like<00:01:07.009> nah<00:01:07.490> no<00:01:07.549> sorry<00:01:07.909> for<00:01:07.970> Network

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
like nah no sorry for Network

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.539 
like nah no sorry for Network
destructively<00:01:09.110> what<00:01:09.829> I<00:01:09.860> would<00:01:10.070> do<00:01:10.220> at<00:01:10.340> this

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
destructively what I would do at this

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.640 
destructively what I would do at this
stage<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.329> create<00:01:11.750> what's<00:01:11.930> called<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.290> merged

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
stage is create what's called a merged

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.350 
stage is create what's called a merged
or<00:01:12.920> combine<00:01:13.280> layer<00:01:13.549> at<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.790> top<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.180> layer

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
or combine layer at the top of the layer

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.030 
or combine layer at the top of the layer
stack<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:15.049> there's<00:01:15.229> lots<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.560> ways<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.770> can

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
stack now there's lots of ways you can

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.800 
stack now there's lots of ways you can
do<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.430> there's<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.729> big<00:01:16.970> long<00:01:17.270> keyboard

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
do that there's that big long keyboard

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.069 
do that there's that big long keyboard
shortcut<00:01:18.319> of<00:01:18.560> ctrl<00:01:18.770> alt<00:01:19.520> shift<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.149> E<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
shortcut of ctrl alt shift and E and

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.649 
shortcut of ctrl alt shift and E and
what<00:01:21.259> that's<00:01:21.409> gonna<00:01:21.530> do<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.799> going<00:01:22.039> to<00:01:22.100> put<00:01:22.340> a

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
what that's gonna do is going to put a

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.120 
what that's gonna do is going to put a
combination<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.840> all<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.229> layers<00:01:24.439> below<00:01:24.710> here

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
combination of all the layers below here

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.160 
combination of all the layers below here
into<00:01:25.939> one<00:01:26.119> layer<00:01:26.359> above<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.899> can<00:01:27.020> see

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
into one layer above and you can see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.870 
into one layer above and you can see
when<00:01:27.289> I<00:01:27.319> turn<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.560> layer<00:01:27.890> off<00:01:28.130> nothing

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
when I turn that layer off nothing

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.489 
when I turn that layer off nothing
changes<00:01:29.509> even<00:01:29.810> those<00:01:29.929> are<00:01:30.139> turned<00:01:30.289> off

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
changes even those are turned off

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.649 
changes even those are turned off
because<00:01:30.950> they're<00:01:31.429> now<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:31.579> combined<00:01:32.149> layer<00:01:32.450> at

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
because they're now a combined layer at

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.450 
because they're now a combined layer at
the<00:01:32.689> top<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.109> layer<00:01:33.289> stack<00:01:33.319> another<00:01:34.219> way

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
the top of the layer stack another way

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.010 
the top of the layer stack another way
that<00:01:34.639> you<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.909> do<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.539> just<00:01:35.869> go<00:01:35.990> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
that you can do that is just go to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.200 
that you can do that is just go to
select<00:01:36.740> all<00:01:37.990> edit<00:01:38.990> copy<00:01:39.950> merged<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.850> then

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
select all edit copy merged and then

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
select all edit copy merged and then
edit<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.840> paste<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:42.889> does<00:01:43.039> exactly<00:01:43.429> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
edit and paste and that does exactly the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.730 
edit and paste and that does exactly the
same<00:01:43.729> thing<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.659> kind<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.079> saves<00:01:45.530> you

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
same thing it just kind of saves you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.739 
same thing it just kind of saves you
having<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:46.009> do<00:01:46.219> a<00:01:46.249> bit<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.429> origami<00:01:47.270> origami

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
having to do a bit of origami origami

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.480 
having to do a bit of origami origami
doesn't<00:01:48.409> dance<00:01:48.560> any<00:01:48.829> fingers<00:01:49.189> all<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.369> way

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
doesn't dance any fingers all the way

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.010 
doesn't dance any fingers all the way
across<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.880> earth<00:01:50.060> across<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.479> keyboard<00:01:50.689> so

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
across the earth across the keyboard so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.569 
across the earth across the keyboard so
that's<00:01:51.469> another<00:01:51.649> way<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:51.829> can<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.249> and<00:01:52.490> you

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
that's another way you can do it and you

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.859 
that's another way you can do it and you
can<00:01:52.700> maybe<00:01:52.819> program<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.509> as<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> keyboard

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
can maybe program that as a keyboard

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.139 
can maybe program that as a keyboard
shortcut<00:01:54.049> as<00:01:54.469> well<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.459> if<00:01:55.729> we're<00:01:55.909> gonna<00:01:55.999> now

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
shortcut as well so if we're gonna now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.550 
shortcut as well so if we're gonna now
carry<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.569> working<00:01:56.689> I'm<00:01:57.020> now<00:01:57.139> gonna<00:01:57.289> have<00:01:57.469> to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
carry on working I'm now gonna have to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.760 
carry on working I'm now gonna have to
go<00:01:57.709> to<00:01:57.770> my<00:01:58.579> Nick<00:01:58.939> color<00:01:59.240> Efex<00:01:59.420> Pro<00:01:59.689> 4<00:01:59.929> I<00:02:00.109> need<00:02:00.619> to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
go to my Nick color Efex Pro 4 I need to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.349 
go to my Nick color Efex Pro 4 I need to
be<00:02:00.889> working<00:02:01.249> on<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.520> image<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:01.999> couldn't<00:02:02.270> have

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
be working on the image I couldn't have

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.910 
be working on the image I couldn't have
worked<00:02:02.539> on<00:02:02.749> it<00:02:02.869> where<00:02:03.319> we've<00:02:03.409> got<00:02:03.499> this<00:02:03.590> group

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
worked on it where we've got this group

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.590 
worked on it where we've got this group
so<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.189> needed<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.549> have<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.850> image<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.240> work<00:02:05.389> on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so I needed to have the image to work on

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.359 
so I needed to have the image to work on
which<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.109> why<00:02:06.289> I've<00:02:06.469> now<00:02:06.619> created<00:02:06.889> this

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
which is why I've now created this

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.249 
which is why I've now created this
merged<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:07.909> combined<00:02:08.240> layer<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.840> then<00:02:09.229> I

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
merged or combined layer and then I

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.690 
merged or combined layer and then I
would<00:02:09.440> come<00:02:09.649> into<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.920> filter<00:02:10.250> menu<00:02:10.369> go<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
would come into the filter menu go to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.970 
would come into the filter menu go to
the<00:02:10.849> Nick<00:02:11.030> collection<00:02:11.569> core<00:02:12.200> effects<00:02:12.470> Pro<00:02:12.709> 4

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the Nick collection core effects Pro 4

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
the Nick collection core effects Pro 4
and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.370> would<00:02:13.490> come<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.910> once<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> actual

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and then I would come in once the actual

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.440 
and then I would come in once the actual
plugin<00:02:15.380> opens<00:02:15.709> up<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.240> start

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
plugin opens up and then we can start

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.420 
plugin opens up and then we can start
applying<00:02:17.540> some<00:02:17.840> effects<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:18.500> let's<00:02:19.069> say<00:02:19.220> here

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
applying some effects so let's say here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.800 
applying some effects so let's say here
we're<00:02:19.520> gonna<00:02:19.640> come<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:19.940> use<00:02:20.060> some<00:02:20.240> detail

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
we're gonna come and use some detail

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
we're gonna come and use some detail
extractors<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.560> we'll<00:02:21.680> add<00:02:21.830> that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
extractors so we'll add that

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.430 
extractors so we'll add that
there<00:02:23.060> may<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.330> bit<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> cross<00:02:23.810> balance<00:02:24.170> into

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
there may be a bit of cross balance into

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.780 
there may be a bit of cross balance into
adding<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.739> real<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.160> bluish<00:02:25.520> kind<00:02:25.700> of

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
adding a real kind of bluish kind of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.729 
adding a real kind of bluish kind of
mood<00:02:25.940> which<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.450> quite<00:02:26.599> like<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:27.560> come

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
mood which I really quite like just come

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.589 
mood which I really quite like just come
down<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:28.160> well<00:02:28.640> go<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:28.940> something<00:02:29.239> nice<00:02:29.360> and

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
down here well go for something nice and

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.420 
down here well go for something nice and
subtle<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.170> should<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.590> go<00:02:30.680> for<00:02:30.890> tungsten<00:02:31.130> to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
subtle I should just go for tungsten to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.280 
subtle I should just go for tungsten to
daylight<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.390> we<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.599> control<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.930> strength

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
daylight and we can control a strength

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.229 
daylight and we can control a strength
there<00:02:33.500> with<00:02:33.590> those<00:02:33.709> kind<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:33.980> sliders<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.970> when

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
there with those kind of sliders so when

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.089 
there with those kind of sliders so when
I'm<00:02:35.330> using<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.599> third<00:02:35.780> party<00:02:36.110> plug-in<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.680> can

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
I'm using a third party plug-in I can

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.380 
I'm using a third party plug-in I can
continue<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.790> kind<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.060> add<00:02:38.209> all<00:02:38.300> these

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
continue to kind of add all these

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.940

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.779 
when I just save that it's gonna affect
the<00:05:51.019> final<00:05:51.499> image<00:05:51.769> shows<00:05:52.069> a<00:05:52.099> completely

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
the final image shows a completely

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.359 
the final image shows a completely
non-destructive<00:05:53.269> workflow<00:05:53.959> I<00:05:54.559> can<00:05:55.009> go<00:05:55.129> all

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:55.369 
non-destructive workflow I can go all

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.759 
non-destructive workflow I can go all
the<00:05:55.639> way<00:05:55.669> down<00:05:56.029> and<00:05:56.269> even<00:05:56.629> but<00:05:57.199> the<00:05:57.409> bottom

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:57.769 
the way down and even but the bottom

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:59.529 
the way down and even but the bottom
layer<00:05:57.949> here<00:05:58.309> has<00:05:58.519> got<00:05:58.639> a<00:05:58.669> smart<00:05:58.909> object<00:05:59.360> so

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
layer here has got a smart object so

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.119 
layer here has got a smart object so
what<00:05:59.899> happens<00:06:00.139> when<00:06:00.259> I<00:06:00.319> double<00:06:00.829> click<00:06:00.860> on<00:06:01.009> a

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
what happens when I double click on a

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.919 
what happens when I double click on a
thumbnail<00:06:01.219> there<00:06:01.759> well<00:06:02.479> then<00:06:02.599> that's<00:06:02.809> gonna

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:02.929 
thumbnail there well then that's gonna

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.259 
thumbnail there well then that's gonna
take<00:06:03.199> me<00:06:03.289> it's<00:06:03.439> a<00:06:03.499> Camera<00:06:03.889> Raw<00:06:04.099> so<00:06:04.819> I<00:06:04.849> can<00:06:05.119> now

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:05.269 
take me it's a Camera Raw so I can now

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:07.540 
take me it's a Camera Raw so I can now
see<00:06:05.509> what<00:06:05.629> my<00:06:05.749> original<00:06:05.929> image<00:06:06.709> was<00:06:06.829> like<00:06:07.069> and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
see what my original image was like and

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.619 
see what my original image was like and
let's<00:06:07.819> have<00:06:07.939> a<00:06:07.969> lot<00:06:08.089> of<00:06:08.149> kind<00:06:08.300> of<00:06:08.329> things<00:06:08.509> that

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
let's have a lot of kind of things that

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.479 
let's have a lot of kind of things that
we<00:06:08.689> did<00:06:08.869> did<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.110> do<00:06:09.169> any<00:06:09.379> kind<00:06:09.439> of<00:06:09.800> use<00:06:10.249> of<00:06:10.279> the

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:10.489 
we did did I do any kind of use of the

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:11.919 
we did did I do any kind of use of the
adjust<00:06:10.969> one<00:06:11.119> process<00:06:11.360> right<00:06:11.479> click<00:06:11.719> on<00:06:11.839> the

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:11.929 
adjust one process right click on the

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:13.689 
adjust one process right click on the
adjustment<00:06:12.169> brush<00:06:12.379> here<00:06:13.099> we've<00:06:13.219> got<00:06:13.309> a<00:06:13.369> pin

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
adjustment brush here we've got a pin

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.179 
adjustment brush here we've got a pin
where<00:06:14.269> I<00:06:14.300> click<00:06:14.719> and<00:06:15.379> I<00:06:15.469> can<00:06:15.499> actually<00:06:15.860> come<00:06:16.069> in

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189 
where I click and I can actually come in

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.279 
where I click and I can actually come in
and<00:06:16.369> make<00:06:16.489> adjustments<00:06:17.449> to<00:06:17.479> the<00:06:17.599> eyes<00:06:17.929> if<00:06:18.229> I

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
and make adjustments to the eyes if I

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.299 
and make adjustments to the eyes if I
didn't<00:06:18.559> think<00:06:18.649> they<00:06:18.769> were<00:06:18.860> actually<00:06:19.159> that

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:19.309 
didn't think they were actually that

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:21.359 
didn't think they were actually that
good<00:06:19.489> so<00:06:20.149> you<00:06:20.239> can<00:06:20.360> see<00:06:20.539> if<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.689> do<00:06:20.749> noise

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:21.369 
good so you can see if I do noise

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.829 
good so you can see if I do noise
non-destructive<00:06:22.369> retouching<00:06:22.999> it's<00:06:23.569> going<00:06:23.779> to

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:23.839 
non-destructive retouching it's going to

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.659 
non-destructive retouching it's going to
allow<00:06:23.989> you<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.379> flexibility<00:06:25.099> to<00:06:25.129> come<00:06:25.519> in

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
allow you the flexibility to come in

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.129 
allow you the flexibility to come in
later<00:06:25.939> on<00:06:26.239> when<00:06:26.389> you're<00:06:26.449> doing<00:06:26.629> your<00:06:26.659> changes

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
later on when you're doing your changes

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.019 
later on when you're doing your changes
because<00:06:27.439> sometimes<00:06:27.860> we<00:06:28.429> do<00:06:28.610> get<00:06:28.789> a<00:06:28.819> really

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
because sometimes we do get a really

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.459 
because sometimes we do get a really
code<00:06:29.329> away<00:06:29.539> with<00:06:29.689> our<00:06:29.779> retouch<00:06:30.079> and<00:06:30.289> we<00:06:30.349> get

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
code away with our retouch and we get

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.219 
code away with our retouch and we get
pixel<00:06:30.919> blind<00:06:31.159> we<00:06:31.669> do<00:06:31.819> so<00:06:32.119> much<00:06:32.329> work<00:06:32.509> and<00:06:32.869> then

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
pixel blind we do so much work and then

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.989 
pixel blind we do so much work and then
we<00:06:33.349> save<00:06:33.619> it<00:06:33.829> and<00:06:34.009> then<00:06:34.099> when<00:06:34.550> we<00:06:34.639> look<00:06:34.819> at<00:06:34.909> the

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
we save it and then when we look at the

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.339 
we save it and then when we look at the
picture<00:06:35.239> again<00:06:35.269> with<00:06:35.569> fresh<00:06:35.809> eyes<00:06:36.019> were<00:06:36.229> like

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
picture again with fresh eyes were like

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.249 
picture again with fresh eyes were like
I<00:06:36.589> didn't<00:06:37.159> quite<00:06:37.459> mean<00:06:37.729> to<00:06:37.909> do<00:06:38.059> that<00:06:38.329> if<00:06:38.779> we've

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
I didn't quite mean to do that if we've

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.769 
I didn't quite mean to do that if we've
worked<00:06:39.529> destructively<00:06:40.399> by<00:06:40.999> creating<00:06:41.569> those

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:41.779 
worked destructively by creating those

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.619 
worked destructively by creating those
merged<00:06:42.259> or<00:06:42.589> combined<00:06:43.069> layers<00:06:43.369> you<00:06:44.059> can't<00:06:44.389> go

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
merged or combined layers you can't go

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.920 
merged or combined layers you can't go
back

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
back

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.330 
back
well<00:06:45.440> you<00:06:45.560> can<00:06:45.770> but<00:06:45.979> you're<00:06:46.070> gonna<00:06:46.160> have<00:06:46.250> to

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
well you can but you're gonna have to

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.400 
well you can but you're gonna have to
delete<00:06:46.729> it<00:06:46.790> and<00:06:47.060> then<00:06:47.240> rework<00:06:47.690> lots<00:06:48.050> of<00:06:48.169> layers

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
delete it and then rework lots of layers

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.340 
delete it and then rework lots of layers
but<00:06:48.680> by<00:06:49.160> using<00:06:49.340> smart<00:06:49.910> objects<00:06:50.449> you<00:06:50.900> can<00:06:51.080> kind

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
but by using smart objects you can kind

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.409 
but by using smart objects you can kind
of<00:06:51.410> like<00:06:51.590> go<00:06:51.800> back<00:06:52.070> in<00:06:52.280> time<00:06:52.520> all<00:06:53.150> right<00:06:53.210> so

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
of like go back in time all right so

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.879 
of like go back in time all right so
it's<00:06:53.509> almost<00:06:53.630> like<00:06:53.900> using<00:06:54.080> a<00:06:54.259> time<00:06:54.500> machine<00:06:54.860> go

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
it's almost like using a time machine go

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.370 
it's almost like using a time machine go
back<00:06:55.400> in<00:06:55.550> time<00:06:55.729> make<00:06:56.389> effects<00:06:56.810> or<00:06:57.199> might

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
back in time make effects or might

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.010 
back in time make effects or might
changes<00:06:57.770> way<00:06:58.190> down<00:06:58.550> the<00:06:58.699> line<00:06:58.850> to<00:06:59.570> then<00:06:59.750> get

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
changes way down the line to then get

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.460 
changes way down the line to then get
the<00:07:00.740> final<00:07:01.220> result<00:07:01.490> in<00:07:01.669> the<00:07:01.820> end<00:07:02.030> picture<00:07:02.660> so

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
the final result in the end picture so

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.230 
the final result in the end picture so
that<00:07:03.500> is<00:07:03.830> basically<00:07:04.190> what's<00:07:04.430> used<00:07:04.729> what<00:07:05.120> we

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
that is basically what's used what we

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.659 
that is basically what's used what we
call<00:07:05.479> working<00:07:06.350> non-destructively<00:07:06.770> it's

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
call working non-destructively it's

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.520 
call working non-destructively it's
gonna<00:07:07.759> save<00:07:08.060> you<00:07:08.210> time<00:07:08.479> and<00:07:08.930> quite<00:07:09.229> rightly

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
gonna save you time and quite rightly

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.710 
gonna save you time and quite rightly
they've<00:07:09.770> called<00:07:10.039> it<00:07:10.190> a<00:07:10.340> smart<00:07:10.970> object<00:07:11.479> and<00:07:11.570> a

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
they've called it a smart object and a

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.870 
they've called it a smart object and a
smart<00:07:12.050> filter<00:07:12.199> because<00:07:12.680> it<00:07:12.800> is<00:07:12.949> it's<00:07:13.610> working

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
smart filter because it is it's working

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.670 
smart filter because it is it's working
smart<00:07:14.479> so<00:07:14.720> I<00:07:14.780> hope<00:07:14.900> that<00:07:14.960> kind<00:07:15.199> of<00:07:15.259> helps<00:07:15.320> how

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
smart so I hope that kind of helps how

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.379 
smart so I hope that kind of helps how
that<00:07:15.800> explains<00:07:16.220> what<00:07:16.400> we<00:07:16.460> mean<00:07:16.699> by<00:07:17.120> the<00:07:17.180> two

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
that explains what we mean by the two

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.750 
that explains what we mean by the two
terms<00:07:17.660> working<00:07:18.500> non-destructively<00:07:18.919> and

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
terms working non-destructively and

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.870 
terms working non-destructively and
working<00:07:20.419> destructively

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880
