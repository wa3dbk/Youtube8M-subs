00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
easy you can see the LED and the optic

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.009 
easy you can see the LED and the optic
down<00:00:12.580> in<00:00:12.760> there<00:00:12.940> instead<00:00:13.300> of<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:13.480> reflector

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
down in there instead of the reflector

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.170 
down in there instead of the reflector
that<00:00:14.639> Phoenix<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:15.790> a<00:00:15.820> lot<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.029> other

that Phoenix and a lot of other

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.819 
that Phoenix and a lot of other
companies<00:00:16.509> normally<00:00:16.990> use<00:00:17.170> this<00:00:17.349> one<00:00:17.529> just<00:00:17.650> has

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:17.829 
companies normally use this one just has

companies normally use this one just has
an<00:00:17.980> optic<00:00:18.340> but<00:00:19.029> it's<00:00:19.210> nice<00:00:19.390> simple<00:00:19.840> low<00:00:20.200> cost

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
an optic but it's nice simple low cost

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.889 
an optic but it's nice simple low cost
little<00:00:20.860> light<00:00:21.009> we'll<00:00:21.250> take<00:00:21.399> the<00:00:21.520> head<00:00:21.700> off

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:21.899 
little light we'll take the head off

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.359 
little light we'll take the head off
show<00:00:22.899> you<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.110> battery<00:00:23.290> powered<00:00:23.919> by<00:00:24.040> a<00:00:24.070> single

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
show you the battery powered by a single

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.290 
show you the battery powered by a single
one<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:25.029> three<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:26.970> there<00:00:27.970> was<00:00:28.059> a<00:00:28.090> surefire

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
one to three and there was a surefire

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.150 
one to three and there was a surefire
battery<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.110> obviously<00:00:29.529> batteries<00:00:30.040> are<00:00:30.130> not

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
battery so obviously batteries are not

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.220 
battery so obviously batteries are not
included<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:30.820> for<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.509> operation<00:00:32.020> of<00:00:32.110> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
included and for the operation of the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.450 
included and for the operation of the
light<00:00:32.410> what<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:32.739> do<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.130> tighten

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
light what you do is you just tighten

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.040 
light what you do is you just tighten
the<00:00:33.670> head<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.120> then<00:00:34.629> to<00:00:34.750> get<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:34.899> your

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
the head and then to get to your

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.020 
the head and then to get to your
different<00:00:35.440> modes<00:00:35.559> just<00:00:35.949> loosen<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:36.969> tighten

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
different modes just loosen and tighten

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.000 
different modes just loosen and tighten
the<00:00:37.329> head<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:38.559> three<00:00:38.890> different

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
the head and you have three different

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.450 
the head and you have three different
outputs<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.699> you<00:00:39.760> can<00:00:39.969> choose<00:00:40.089> between<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
outputs that you can choose between and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.279 
outputs that you can choose between and
that's<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.789> really<00:00:43.300> simple<00:00:43.750> uncomplicated

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
with the e 15 got the big 40 mag light

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.340 
with the e 15 got the big 40 mag light
that<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.089> always<00:00:58.239> use<00:00:58.510> let's<00:00:58.899> go<00:00:58.989> ahead<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.230> try

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
that I always use let's go ahead and try

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.040 
that I always use let's go ahead and try
out<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.710> mag<00:00:59.890> light<00:01:00.629> there's<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.690> little<00:01:01.870> Bush

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
out the mag light there's a little Bush

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.299 
out the mag light there's a little Bush
15<00:01:02.679> feet<00:01:02.890> away

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
15 feet away

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.149 
15 feet away
let's<00:01:04.030> actually<00:01:04.180> focus<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.229> then

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
let's actually focus that in and then

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.399 
let's actually focus that in and then
tree<00:01:06.640> out<00:01:06.790> there<00:01:06.820> at<00:01:07.030> 100<00:01:07.329> feet<00:01:07.479> are<00:01:08.200> go

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
tree out there at 100 feet are go

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.260 
tree out there at 100 feet are go
wandering<00:01:08.740> around<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:12.130> let's<00:01:12.369> try<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.640> e<00:01:12.790> 15

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
wandering around now let's try the e 15

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.300 
wandering around now let's try the e 15
to<00:01:13.659> see<00:01:13.780> how<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.020> does<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.040> can<00:01:18.189> see

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
to see how it does there you can see

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.100 
to see how it does there you can see
definitely<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.880> wider<00:01:19.090> area<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.600> illumination

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
definitely a wider area of illumination

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.950 
definitely a wider area of illumination
you<00:01:20.469> see<00:01:20.860> our<00:01:21.070> go<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.250> little<00:01:21.430> bit<00:01:21.579> better<00:01:21.960> zoom

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
you see our go a little bit better zoom

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.289 
you see our go a little bit better zoom
in<00:01:23.110> on<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.880> switch<00:01:24.880> between<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.270> different

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
in on that switch between the different

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.050 
in on that switch between the different
outputs<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:26.829> was<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.100> highest<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:27.909> the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
outputs that was the highest this is the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.510 
outputs that was the highest this is the
lowest<00:01:28.299> but<00:01:28.689> just<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.020> show<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:30.009> does<00:01:30.250> do

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
lowest but just to show you it does do

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.880 
lowest but just to show you it does do
up-close<00:01:31.030> illumination<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:32.590> fine<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.990> then

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
up-close illumination just fine and then

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
up-close illumination just fine and then
there<00:01:36.579> you<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:36.850> there's<00:01:37.600> your<00:01:37.659> highest<00:01:37.990> output

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
there you go there's your highest output

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
there you go there's your highest output
shining<00:01:40.360> around<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.630> little<00:01:40.750> bit<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.079> guess<00:01:41.140> we

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
shining around a little bit I guess we

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.429 
shining around a little bit I guess we
had<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.590> actually<00:01:41.829> on<00:01:41.950> medium<00:01:42.310> initially<00:01:43.439> but

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
had it actually on medium initially but

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.349 
had it actually on medium initially but
not<00:01:44.920> bad<00:01:45.100> for<00:01:45.280> such<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.430> tiny<00:01:45.670> compact<00:01:45.939> little

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
not bad for such a tiny compact little

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.060 
not bad for such a tiny compact little
light<00:01:46.600> pretty<00:01:47.259> impressive<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.829> it<00:01:47.950> can

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
light pretty impressive that it can

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.010 
light pretty impressive that it can
outshine<00:01:48.399> something<00:01:49.060> hundred<00:01:49.600> times<00:01:49.780> its

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
outshine something hundred times its
