bedroom simply to make a very cheeky
video<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.830> chinky<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.430> could<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
video I think it's chinky it could be a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060 
video I think it's chinky it could be a
little<00:00:18.029> tricky<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.960> I've<00:00:19.410> always<00:00:19.710> thought

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
little tricky so I've always thought

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370 
little tricky so I've always thought
that<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.550> telepathic<00:00:21.480> people<00:00:22.170> always<00:00:22.260> ask

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that we're telepathic people always ask

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.200 
that we're telepathic people always ask
us<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.130> might<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.460> no<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> reckon<00:00:24.150> we

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
us I think we might be no I reckon we

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.670 
us I think we might be no I reckon we
are<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> put<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.470> test

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
are but we need to put it to the test

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.550 
are but we need to put it to the test
and<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.400> someone<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.990> who
