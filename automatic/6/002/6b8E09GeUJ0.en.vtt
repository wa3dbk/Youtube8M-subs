and<00:00:44.870> bending<00:00:45.370> Ludwig<00:00:46.370> fixed<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.740> years

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
and bending Ludwig fixed that years

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.590 
and bending Ludwig fixed that years
later<00:00:48.830> by<00:00:49.370> rounding<00:00:49.940> out<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.150> corners<00:00:50.570> so

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
later by rounding out the corners so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.810 
later by rounding out the corners so
you'll<00:00:50.870> see<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.140> in<00:00:51.260> future<00:00:51.470> vintages<00:00:52.100> the
