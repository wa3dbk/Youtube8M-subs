00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
working so after you put in the code for

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.789 
working so after you put in the code for
413<00:00:59.329> put<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.559> enter<00:01:02.190> button<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:03.000> that

the door will open come in and it closes

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
the door will open come in and it closes
this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> reset<00:01:08.610> button<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.180> click<00:01:09.299> ok<00:01:12.830> so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.960 

enter

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.230 

I<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.750> light<00:01:27.840> comes<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:29.160> say<00:01:29.910> you<00:01:29.940> were

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I really light comes on but say you were

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
I really light comes on but say you were
a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.420> tricky<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.650> knew<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.160> most

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
a little tricky and you knew that most

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.230 
a little tricky and you knew that most
keypads<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.410> weakness<00:01:34.970> where<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
keypads and a little weakness where you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:47.360 
keypads and a little weakness where you
could<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:42.230> 4413<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:46.740> weakness<00:01:46.980> is

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
could go for 4413 this weakness is

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.580 
could go for 4413 this weakness is
you're<00:01:47.970> still<00:01:48.300> putting<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.780> code<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you're still putting in the code in the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.780 
you're still putting in the code in the
right<00:01:49.860> order<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.370> adding<00:01:53.580> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
right order but you're just adding a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.640 
right order but you're just adding a
little<00:01:53.820> bit<00:01:54.090> digit<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.140> adding<00:01:55.440> a

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
little bit digit in you're just adding a

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.590 
little bit digit in you're just adding a
digit<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.220> between<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.360> shouldn't

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
digit in between because that shouldn't

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
digit in between because that shouldn't
make<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.720> difference<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.560> basically<00:02:02.190> if

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
make a difference but so basically if

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.940 
make a difference but so basically if
you<00:02:02.460> put<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.790> five<00:02:03.030> digits<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.770> one<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.830> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you put in five digits and one of them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.389 
you put in five digits and one of them
is<00:02:04.979> wrong<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.760> doesn't<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:07.340> make<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
is wrong it doesn't really make a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.990 
is wrong it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> I'll<00:02:09.149> show<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.730> doesn't

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
difference and I'll show you it doesn't

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720 
difference and I'll show you it doesn't
mind<00:02:15.360> though<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.680> most<00:02:16.920> people's<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
mind though but on most people's it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.000 
mind though but on most people's it
doesn't<00:02:18.090> door<00:02:18.780> would<00:02:19.110> still<00:02:19.380> open<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> did

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
doesn't door would still open if you did

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.760 
doesn't door would still open if you did
that<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.060> that's<00:02:21.450> why<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:21.840> keypad<00:02:22.170> special<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that so that's why my keypad special and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.710 
that so that's why my keypad special and
so<00:02:22.860> complex<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:26.060> basically<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.209> happens<00:02:27.570> is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
so complex so basically what happens is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.870 
so complex so basically what happens is
I'm<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.080> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> simplify<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> ferry<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
I'm just going to simplify this ferry to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.910 
I'm just going to simplify this ferry to
a<00:02:29.910> beginners<00:02:30.270> level<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.890> just

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
a beginners level because this is just

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.180 
a beginners level because this is just
way<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.510> take<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.410> an<00:02:34.560> hour<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.860> explain

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
way I it take like an hour to explain

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.449 
way I it take like an hour to explain
completely<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.980> basically<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:38.459> happens<00:02:38.870> is

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
completely so basically what happens is

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.699 
completely so basically what happens is
gonna<00:02:41.459> be<00:02:41.580> first<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.910> button<00:02:42.180> first<00:02:42.709> second

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
gonna be first a button first second

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.640 
gonna be first a button first second
base<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.190> torch<00:02:44.459> doesn't<00:02:44.550> activate<00:02:45.000> yet

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
base this torch doesn't activate yet

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.220 
base this torch doesn't activate yet
which<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.890> button<00:02:47.160> for<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.360> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
which the button for now is for so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.449 
which the button for now is for so
whenever<00:02:49.440> you're<00:02:49.560> pressed<00:02:49.769> for<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.250> torch

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
whenever you're pressed for this torch

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
whenever you're pressed for this torch
is<00:02:50.580> deactivated<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.720> repress<00:02:51.989> for

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
is deactivated I'm going to repress for

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
is deactivated I'm going to repress for
again<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.920> one's<00:02:53.100> deactivated<00:02:53.700> which<00:02:53.940> will

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
again this one's deactivated which will

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.259 
again this one's deactivated which will
