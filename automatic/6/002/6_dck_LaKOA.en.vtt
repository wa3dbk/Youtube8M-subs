a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> times<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> comes<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
a lot of the times when it comes to
games<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> play<00:00:48.660> something<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
games when you play something in

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.979 
games when you play something in
windowed<00:00:49.559> mode<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.579> looks<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.690> cheesy

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
windowed mode it just looks very cheesy

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500 
windowed mode it just looks very cheesy
um<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.910> screens<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.360> I'll

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
um because there's the screens here I'll

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
um because there's the screens here I'll
give<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.690> example<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> play<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> you'll

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
give you example when you play it you'll

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
give you example when you play it you'll
see<00:00:57.300> there's<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.129> title

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
see there's this you know the the title

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.299 
see there's this you know the the title
bar<00:00:59.699> over<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.920> these

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
bar over here and you still have these

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
bar over here and you still have these
uh<00:01:02.960> these<00:01:03.960> bars<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.949> stuff<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
uh these bars on the side and stuff like

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.600 
uh these bars on the side and stuff like
that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
that
so<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> windowed<00:01:07.290> mode<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so this is it's in windowed mode but it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.020 
so this is it's in windowed mode but it
just<00:01:08.549> doesn't<00:01:08.939> look<00:01:09.090> nice<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.520> reason<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
just doesn't look nice and the reason I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
just doesn't look nice and the reason I
want<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:15.740> for<00:01:16.740> example

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
want it like this is because for example

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.050 
want it like this is because for example
right<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.490> recording<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.939> Camtasia

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
right now I'm recording with Camtasia

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.249 
right now I'm recording with Camtasia
Studio<00:01:18.710> when<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.860> recording<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.869> game<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
Studio when I'm recording and a game is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
Studio when I'm recording and a game is
in<00:01:22.380> full<00:01:22.619> screen<00:01:22.860> Camtasia<00:01:23.460> Studio<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:24.360> not

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
in full screen Camtasia Studio does not

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
in full screen Camtasia Studio does not
recognize<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.710> can't<00:01:26.420> record<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
recognize that and I can't record the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.640 
recognize that and I can't record the
game<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.990> able<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.229> record

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
game so if I want to be able to record

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.310 
game so if I want to be able to record
the<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:32.040> uh<00:01:35.299> while<00:01:36.299> using<00:01:36.720> Camtasia<00:01:37.259> Studio

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the game uh while using Camtasia Studio

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
the game uh while using Camtasia Studio
as<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> play<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.210> windowed

as well I have to play it in windowed
one<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> disadvantage<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> when

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
one but the disadvantage of that is when

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
one but the disadvantage of that is when
I'm<00:01:42.090> playing<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> windowed<00:01:42.899> mode<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I'm playing it in windowed mode the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.139 
I'm playing it in windowed mode the
title<00:01:43.920> bar<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> everything<00:01:45.000> just

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
title bar is here and everything just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.380 
title bar is here and everything just
doesn't<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:45.840> nice<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.689> in<00:01:48.689> order<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:50.360> make<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
doesn't look nice so in order to make a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149 
doesn't look nice so in order to make a
game<00:01:51.750> seem<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.380> still<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.649> full-screen

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
