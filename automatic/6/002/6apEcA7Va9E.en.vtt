00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.150
 hi to all these olives too much info 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.869
 that's it then today we're going 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.610
 talk about agriculture wii knowing 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 talk about no I'm joking of course 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 so compared to the demand for 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 a lot of game users I was told 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.699
 but live windows software especially 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.079
 moviemaker and in English what do I 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.030
 make 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 and bah listen to the answer right away 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 so for example moviemaker I put myself to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 the place of the user who associates the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 so I never know about change or 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.579
 hummed heart so I always use the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 menu at the bottom left they over there 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 research is very very well done on 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.329
 windows 7 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.909
 we find immediately software so 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.289
 it's this and here and there I want to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 tell the currents so help 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.360
 why ah well yes because my game 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.369
 my game my software and English so 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.259
 that's what I have to do 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.120
 at that moment so there are several 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.870
 solutions makes it a 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.900
 alas not just one to many 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.610
 first already so that's either I'm going 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 in the panel program 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 sorry configuration and I'm going to look 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 the menu called parameters of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.210
 windows live language so that's getting 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.070
 find then sometimes he's not there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.550
 but I already propose this solution 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.860
 because every time we install 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.320
 movie maker windows live mail gallery 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.330
 live messenger that are services 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.070
 live from windows so that's why 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.180
 after that there is this option that gets put 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.550
 soup to other configurations so I 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.800
 click on it and there he offers me 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.900
 sure it's settled down in English 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.830
 so I can change the language 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.690
 directly like that simply 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:09.090
 French is right there once I 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.640
 do ok I do ok here he proposes me 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.850
 to reinstall windows the essential friend 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.000
 in French so I do yes and we are 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.620
 left you will see a little while 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 a progress bar to get in 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
 road 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 here it is and we will leave 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.370
 make 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870
 to see the progression not as we 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.030
 can see here we are always at 0% 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.680
 inevitably it advances that advance any 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 gently reinstall the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.100
 pack in France is so especially the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.100
 windows live software that are all the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.090
 family and see you later 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.330
 so see you soon 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.400
 and here is a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.950
 5 between five and ten minutes later 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.440
 once the French pack has become 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.910
 installed we have this message that goes 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.190
 in the middle so always in English 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.610
 of course because the software at the base 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.290
 was in English so we shut up and 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.060
 now we can check 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.720
 that's if the software has been installed and 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.700
 amy sorry in French so that's all 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.350
 is written in French 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.290
 other solution because in the panel 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.090
 cooperation as we have seen it can 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.510
 that there is no yes I have been on the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.210
 forums 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.580
 some say ben thin mine 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.950
 is not so we will go in a little bit 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.870
 the more complex we go in marshes 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.510
 computers chose hard drive 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.890
 where we install the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.740
 software so the good program files 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.020
 since the night of time and we 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.310
 go down with the wheel and we search 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.340
 by the loss war called windows 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.450
 live so just here we speak again of 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.310
 the family windows mail 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.010
 so that's where everything is grouped well 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.110
 sure the mails and photos gallery the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.780
 mobi but heart and I go back then 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.290
 in the person installed installed 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.989
 and the long age selector so double 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.640
 click on it and chose the language 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.860
 of course that like to reinstall in 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.150
 France and therefore will not lend French 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.739
 so we choose the French did 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.470
 hockey and I have the progress bar 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.420
 who is getting back into place that's all 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.640
 simply 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.810
 another solution the third and the 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 last I'm going to start it panel from 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.120

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.610

 live windows where lay live windows and 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.930
 I uninstall everything once 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.509
