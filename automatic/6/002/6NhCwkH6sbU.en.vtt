activities unbelievable and this nothing
it's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.280> even<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.580> they're<00:03:32.760> trying<00:03:32.880> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
it's not even like they're trying to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.640 
it's not even like they're trying to
help<00:03:33.270> me<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> could<00:03:33.900> help<00:03:34.020> them<00:03:34.200> I'm<00:03:34.410> trying

to help them but nothing's happening so

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.820 
to help them but nothing's happening so
that's<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:37.830> reasoning<00:03:38.280> behind<00:03:38.430> everything

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
that's my reasoning behind everything

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.080 
that's my reasoning behind everything
they<00:03:40.830> are<00:03:40.860> not<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.160> bad<00:03:41.370> clan<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:41.970> just

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
they are not a bad clan it's just

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
they are not a bad clan it's just
activity<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.780> gone<00:03:42.989> down<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.860> point

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
activity is gone down it's to the point

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.040 
activity is gone down it's to the point
to<00:03:44.190> where<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.910> they<00:03:45.360> don't<00:03:45.510> even<00:03:45.690> care<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
to where not they don't even care it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.410 
to where not they don't even care it
seems<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.530> some<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.250> them<00:03:47.430> don't<00:03:47.580> care<00:03:47.880> some

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
seems like some of them don't care some

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.360 
seems like some of them don't care some
of<00:03:48.540> them<00:03:48.600> are<00:03:48.720> great<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:49.770> active<00:03:50.220> and
