00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:48.690
 the series 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590
 of a vehicle that would look like it is in history 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 the fusca 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.500
 known as pit armar 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.990
 seeing a beacon through the streets is very common but one with 44 years nine thousand miles

 the numbering plates in contacts beyond the perfect finish 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.360
 other details are curious 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.720
 the rubber door 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.940
 already deteriorated justifies the originality of the car as well as the arrow 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.290

 he gave a charm is the success of water to clean the windshield a dove that 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.740
 under the panel just press 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.440
 to work but the dictator who works can not be fired because the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.310
 rubber is also worn and you can see it in the video but if you change it will not be anymore 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.219
 or regional 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.349

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.150
 and from inside the car also does not expose itself to the operation beyond 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.379

 it reaches 63 per hour 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080
 a jewel that at three years is the girl of the son's eyes 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.159
 68 years after the design of the fusca he has gone through this more than 60 thousand 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.429
 change your snub 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.839
 Let's talk to reginaldo Mila the owner of this fusca. 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.869
 that of the year 1962 all reginaldo in maceiÃ³ homosexuals 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.249
 How much did you buy this charge? 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.989
 but if in this car 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.619
 was purchased from a friend who was told 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.629
 relative shows 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.479
 Sao Goncalo 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.049
 he spoke highly esteemed those who know that you receive a proposal for sale 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 Why did you refuse? 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 first I think the value 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.260
 what was offered to us 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.019
 it is a good value sooner the affection that we have with the car and 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.469
 Tell me that you've had 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.419
 this ride on his side but what's worth more 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.579
 we already noticed that the setad has a play with the right time without this as 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.539
 customer can tell this piece that is possible when that person you 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.569
 have to leave the state can find it 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.249
 there is no demand in several parts stores I could not 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.260
 I have information that does not 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.750
 in these old car encounters there are always people 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.029
 negotiated this may pass 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.499

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.279
 at home and carla regina again 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:36.249
 same car adapted from the regional by age and year that was manufactured all 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.979
 calls attention but has some detail if they burn 'the cable they had more 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:41.600
 attention 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
 I find it interesting that the 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.029
 was forgotten of the year in the windshield that appears a bottle that you 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.409
 triggered 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:52.930
 manually 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.940
 and the other hot air heater system he owns works well leading a 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.509
 valve from inside the car because it made an air box a fan sent 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.970
 the architect and is reserved for the interior of the vehicle that leaves here in the 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.060
 floor that 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.500
 because the model that is German I bet on him as many worshipers of the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.889
 the regional market is one more 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.169
 And as he says Bauru 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.979
 recently such a macedo of the brand at home 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
