00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.580
 one more point 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.310
 points 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.610
 point 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.879
 being then 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.059
 with the second part of the rhythm 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.829
 let's resign ourselves 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.499
 with a rotation 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.130
 out, notice that my odyssey is closed 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.470
 trying not to let this happen 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.839
 bounce 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.669
 backward 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.669
 I repeat back 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.040
 a two 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.460
 points 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.720
 one finger 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.020
 waves 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.130
 a two 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.390
 once 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.810
 a two 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.390
 3 I will not show 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.510
 to the other side 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.310
 a pact 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.150
 the blow did well back 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.340
 a two 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 a two 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.670
 point 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 a two 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.879
 Silvia show 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.060
 with one leg and with others set points 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.130
 a tone 13 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.320
 sling 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 point 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 Stitches 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.460
 point 3 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 point 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.340
 a two 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.890
 the variant may be that the rotation 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950
 let's support the whole foot 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.070
 a two 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 about 13 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.940
 point 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.730
 a data 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.510
 points points 13 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.620
 points 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.370
 points 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 we will show it then with the danceable rhythm 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.679
 as well as we work in this decade in plants 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.069
 let's work a score 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.499
 remember then we climb as high as we can 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.849
 as if we had 10 cm blocks 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.949
 we were going to work only the pickets 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.589
 notice that alpízar 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:38.599
 the other foot takes off is not so much the two together 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.939
 track as if they would burn 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.939
 the feet 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.680
 when taking off on foot my career will assume 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.159
 as high as they can 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.109
 order to bring the coccyx back 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.109
 the pelvis forward was taking off 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.479
 dismissal dt 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.609
 in Argentina you need a minimum section of the currency that is not 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.709
 too much nor totally rigid 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.549
 we are going to 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.069
 and take off 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.249
 from the floor 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.959
 raising the hips contrary to the typical 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.179
 once he achieved the movement 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.479
 two go 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.499
 the hip up 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:26.349
 I'm going to try to cut it in the same way I worked it 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.899
 let's try then with the annual rhythm 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.590
 to conclude with the explanation of the movements and steps for the priísmo 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.789
 baladí I'm going to make a small sample and everything we did well the newly 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.340
 for this rhythm there are some new things for you to be bridge and practice 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:55.689
