00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
this little seam right here so what

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.499 
this little seam right here so what
you'll<00:01:47.679> do<00:01:47.829> is<00:01:47.859> you'll<00:01:48.189> kind<00:01:48.429> of<00:01:48.520> tuck<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.450> in

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
you'll do is you'll kind of tuck this in

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.389 
you'll do is you'll kind of tuck this in
here<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.759> close<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.390> handles<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
here and then close the handles now the

here and then close the handles now the
top<00:01:57.819> boots<00:01:58.119> are<00:01:58.389> somewhat<00:01:58.929> difficult<00:01:59.139> to<00:01:59.499> put

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
top boots are somewhat difficult to put

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.709 
top boots are somewhat difficult to put
on<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.490> they're<00:02:00.850> real<00:02:01.090> tight

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.830 
any issues at all it's not a bad idea
when<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.720> put<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> top<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.520> latch<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.450> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
when you put the top up and latch it to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.270 
when you put the top up and latch it to
make<00:02:13.959> sure<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.140> windows<00:02:14.560> are<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.130> way

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
make sure the windows are down this way

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.430 
make sure the windows are down this way
it's<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:15.580> fighting<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.030> windows<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:17.170> again

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
it's not fighting the windows but again

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's not fighting the windows but again
you're<00:02:17.680> probably<00:02:17.740> gonna<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.160> these<00:02:18.250> windows

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
you're probably gonna have these windows

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.600 
you're probably gonna have these windows
down<00:02:18.819> all<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> time<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.770> don't<00:02:21.280> think<00:02:21.520> that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
down all the time so I don't think that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.810 
down all the time so I don't think that
would<00:02:21.700> be<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.850> big<00:02:22.090> issue<00:02:22.240> for<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:24.280> same

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
would be a big issue for you but same

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.630 
would be a big issue for you but same
thing<00:02:24.850> when<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.690> motor<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.200> top<00:02:26.380> up<00:02:26.650> hit<00:02:27.460> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
thing when you motor the top up hit the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:39.910 
thing when you motor the top up hit the
switch

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.500 

and<00:02:40.920> kind<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.220> let<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.850> when<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> gets<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
and kind of let go of it when it gets to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.200 
and kind of let go of it when it gets to
about<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.930> area<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.920> always<00:02:44.670> start<00:02:45.120> with

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
about this area here I always start with

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.780 
about this area here I always start with
the<00:02:45.390> furthest<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:45.990> over<00:02:46.380> here<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.700> of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the furthest one over here and kind of

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.850 
the furthest one over here and kind of
pull<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.420> bring<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:48.990> into<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.440> guide<00:02:51.860> latch

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
pull and bring this into the guide latch

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.300 
pull and bring this into the guide latch
it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
it
same<00:02:53.610> thing<00:02:53.880> here<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.450> pull<00:02:54.690> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
same thing here then you can pull this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.190 
same thing here then you can pull this
down<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.440> latch<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.240> alright<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:58.110> know

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
down and latch it here alright you know

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.650 
down and latch it here alright you know
you<00:02:58.260> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.800> leave<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.160> top<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.850> every

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
you don't have to leave the top up every

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.390 
you don't have to leave the top up every
time<00:03:00.900> you're<00:03:01.170> done<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> car<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.370> I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
time you're done with the car but I

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
time you're done with the car but I
would<00:03:02.610> say<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:02.910> least<00:03:03.120> maybe<00:03:03.390> every<00:03:03.720> couple

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
would say at least maybe every couple

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.380 
would say at least maybe every couple
weeks<00:03:04.200> or<00:03:04.710> once<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.130> month<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.120> even

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
weeks or once a month you know even

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
weeks or once a month you know even
though<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.570> tops<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:06.960> gonna<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.230> down

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
though the tops we're gonna be down

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.260 
though the tops we're gonna be down
every<00:03:07.710> time<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.980> use<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.220> put<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.000> up<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
every time you use it put it up and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.180 
every time you use it put it up and
latch<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.480> it'll<00:03:09.960> keep<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.260> top<00:03:10.500> itself<00:03:10.890> from

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
latch it it'll keep the top itself from

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.190 
latch it it'll keep the top itself from
from<00:03:11.610> shrinking<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.450> eventually<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.080> would

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
from shrinking and eventually it would

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.640 
from shrinking and eventually it would
get<00:03:13.380> more<00:03:13.800> difficult<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.970> latch<00:03:15.650> inside

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
get more difficult to to latch inside

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.030 
get more difficult to to latch inside
the<00:03:17.100> trunk<00:03:19.610> use<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.820> key<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> open<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:22.860> have

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the trunk use the key to open it we have

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.730 
the trunk use the key to open it we have
the<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.910> paint<00:03:24.270> tool<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.990> a<00:03:25.020> level<00:03:25.320> where<00:03:25.560> it's

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
the the paint tool to a level where it's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.500 
the the paint tool to a level where it's
like<00:03:25.860> fine<00:03:26.100> furniture<00:03:26.490> so<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:26.880> real<00:03:27.150> shiny

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
like fine furniture so it's real shiny

like fine furniture so it's real shiny
real<00:03:27.870> smooth<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> idea<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> not<00:03:29.670> touch

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
real smooth so the idea is to not touch

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.640 
real smooth so the idea is to not touch
the<00:03:30.120> paints<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.570> way<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.840> doesn't<00:03:31.020> Mar<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.530> at

the gas tank then when you close the the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.940 
the gas tank then when you close the the
trunk<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.360> use<00:03:51.570> this<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.959> close<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:52.800> have

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
trunk just use this to close it we have

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.070 
trunk just use this to close it we have
it<00:03:53.100> set<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.850> closes<00:03:54.420> right<00:03:54.720> down<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
it set so it just closes right down you

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.560 
it set so it just closes right down you
don't<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.380> slam<00:03:55.620> anything<00:03:56.300> as<00:03:57.300> far<00:03:57.510> as

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
don't have to slam anything as far as

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.970 
don't have to slam anything as far as
underneath<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.170> hood<00:03:58.320> goes<00:04:00.739> open<00:04:01.739> your<00:04:01.860> hood

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
underneath the hood goes open your hood

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.190 
underneath the hood goes open your hood
latch<00:04:02.250> then<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.060> could<00:04:03.209> use<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.600> molding<00:04:04.080> to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
latch then you could use this molding to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.870 
latch then you could use this molding to
lift<00:04:04.440> up<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.250> way<00:04:05.400> you're<00:04:05.610> again

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
lift up on it so this way you're again

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.840 
lift up on it so this way you're again
you're<00:04:06.030> not<00:04:06.150> touching<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.660> paint<00:04:07.519> now<00:04:08.519> John
