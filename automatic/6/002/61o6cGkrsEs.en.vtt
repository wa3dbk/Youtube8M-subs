00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.960
 one 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.450
 all cells have chromosomes 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.480
 forming DNA chains arranged in 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.179
 a certain way 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.369
 viruses that are not considered cells 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:19.160
 they do not have chromosomes but a simple 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.130
 dna chain 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.590
 Bacteria do not have a defined nucleus 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.590
 and that's why they are called prokaryotic cells 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.720
 their chromosomes are spread over the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.720
 cytoplasm without apparent order 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.500
 the bacteria do not have a nucleus 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 defined there are about 3000 species and its 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 population is immense 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 they reproduce by simple my partition and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.420
 they do it at great speed in conditions 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 favorable a bacteria can be divided 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.540
 every 20 minutes after 24 hours 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.210
 I would have an offspring of 300,000 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.210
 millions visible already to the naked eye 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.720
 if a bacterium had a quantity 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 unlimited food after a few 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.600
 weeks its mass would be higher than that of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 the earth 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.990
 but no 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.610
 no no 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.310
 bacteria are living beings 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 smaller autonomous ones that exist 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.439
 the smallest of them surpass us in 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.119
 size to some viruses here we can 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.700
 compare the size of some bacteria 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.700
 currents with the tip of a needle 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.600
 the bacteria have colonized all the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.030
 means the sea the rivers the lakes the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 I soil the subsoil the air the ice of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 the glaciers and the interior of the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.020
 organisms both alive and dead 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.540
 there are those who live in conditions 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
 unbearable for other living beings 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.720
 bacteria have been found up to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.610
 9,000 meters under the sea 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.610
 in the upper layers of the atmosphere 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.790
 on rocks dotted by hot springs and 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.590
 in small water bags on land 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.129
 ice creams 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.700
 they live on the human skin on mucous membranes 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.510
 in the mouth and in the intestine 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.230
 taking advantage of our elements 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.230
 nutritious
