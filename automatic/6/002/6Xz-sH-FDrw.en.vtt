that stuff the other concept is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.480 
that stuff the other concept is
counterbalance<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.930> counterbalance<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.310> do

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.359 
counterbalance and counterbalance you do
every<00:01:50.790> day<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.409> instance<00:01:52.680> here's<00:01:53.220> my

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
every day like so for instance here's my

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.899 
every day like so for instance here's my
character's<00:01:54.170> torso<00:01:55.820> head<00:01:56.820> Mac<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.549> stick<00:01:59.790> my

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
character's torso head Mac if I stick my

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910 
character's torso head Mac if I stick my
arm<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:01.049> centerline<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.829> my

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
arm out and my centerline for my

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.760 
arm out and my centerline for my
character<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.610> still<00:02:02.880> centered<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
character is still centered here that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.700 
character is still centered here that
doesn't<00:02:05.189> feel<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:06.810> there's<00:02:07.049> weight<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.530> his

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
doesn't feel like there's weight to his

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.729 
doesn't feel like there's weight to his
arm<00:02:08.090> versus<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.420> instead<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.170> lean<00:02:10.500> back<00:02:10.709> a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
arm versus it instead I lean back a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.370 
arm versus it instead I lean back a
little<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:12.390> way

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
little bit this way

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
little bit this way
let's<00:02:14.250> say<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> arm<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.910> still<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.210> same

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
let's say the arm is still in the same

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.260 
let's say the arm is still in the same
spot<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> when<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> lift<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.370> arm<00:02:17.610> up<00:02:17.820> I'm<00:02:17.970> also

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
spot so when I lift this arm up I'm also

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.640 
spot so when I lift this arm up I'm also
leaning<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.500> that's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
leaning back a little bit and that's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320 
leaning back a little bit and that's
counterbalance<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.060> sort<00:02:21.270> of

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
counterbalance it's that sort of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.140 
counterbalance it's that sort of
opposing<00:02:21.690> action<00:02:22.230> you're<00:02:22.740> balancing<00:02:23.370> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
opposing action you're balancing this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.870 
opposing action you're balancing this
object<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:25.140> countering<00:02:25.710> your<00:02:25.890> way<00:02:26.220> back<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
object by countering your way back the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.730 
object by countering your way back the
other<00:02:27.030> direction<00:02:27.210> it's<00:02:28.050> something<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.530> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
other direction it's something that you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.110 
other direction it's something that you
kind<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.010> want<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.190> keep<00:02:29.310> consistent<00:02:29.880> because

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
kind of want to keep consistent because

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.370 
kind of want to keep consistent because
it's<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> same<00:02:30.510> idea<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.350> a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's the same idea like this is a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530 
it's the same idea like this is a
consistent<00:02:31.950> weight<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.850> arm<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.210> might<00:02:33.390> only

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
consistent weight so my arm I might only

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.510 
consistent weight so my arm I might only
counterbalance<00:02:34.260> by<00:02:34.410> adjusting<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.190> this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
counterbalance by adjusting back this

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.940 
counterbalance by adjusting back this
much<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.600> my<00:02:36.870> hand<00:02:37.200> had<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> heavy<00:02:37.710> weight

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
much but if my hand had a heavy weight

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950 
much but if my hand had a heavy weight
in<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> then<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.330> would<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.810> to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
in it then I would have to

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.780 
in it then I would have to
counterbalance<00:02:40.440> further<00:02:40.980> back<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
counterbalance further back I would have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670 
counterbalance further back I would have
to<00:02:41.910> adjust<00:02:42.270> more<00:02:42.630> than<00:02:42.990> what<00:02:43.110> I'm<00:02:43.200> doing<00:02:43.230> for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to adjust more than what I'm doing for

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250 
to adjust more than what I'm doing for
this<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:44.460> lifting<00:02:44.790> up<00:02:44.940> my<00:02:44.970> arm<00:02:45.390> which<00:02:46.110> is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this for lifting up my arm which is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.140 
this for lifting up my arm which is
lighter<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.310> might<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:48.060> going

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
lighter so I might have to get going

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.820 
lighter so I might have to get going
further<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:52.530> I'm<00:02:52.650> raising

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
further right so if I if I'm raising

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.220 
further right so if I if I'm raising
this<00:02:53.280> arm<00:02:53.580> right<00:02:53.850> right<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:55.020> do<00:02:55.110> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this arm right right now I can do it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.720 
this arm right right now I can do it
pretty<00:02:55.410> stable<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.370> how<00:02:56.460> my<00:02:56.610> body

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
pretty stable but you see how my body

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.390 
pretty stable but you see how my body
just<00:02:56.910> adjusts<00:02:57.480> backwards<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.990> little<00:02:58.020> bit<00:02:58.400> it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
just adjusts backwards a little bit it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.670 
just adjusts backwards a little bit it's
subtle<00:02:59.730> but<00:02:59.850> I'm<00:03:00.090> leaning<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:01.050> just<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.470> touch

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
subtle but I'm leaning back just a touch

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
subtle but I'm leaning back just a touch
because<00:03:02.220> I'm<00:03:02.370> raising<00:03:02.550> my<00:03:02.820> arm<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.630> that's

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
because I'm raising my arm so that's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.480 
because I'm raising my arm so that's
something<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.080> naturally<00:03:04.350> happens<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
something that naturally happens is you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.790 
something that naturally happens is you
counter<00:03:05.880> move<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.270> way<00:03:06.480> when<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.320> lift<00:03:07.680> up

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
counter move this way when you lift up

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.800 
counter move this way when you lift up
your<00:03:07.950> own<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.220> way<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.610> can<00:03:09.420> do<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.570> holding

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
your own that way I can do it holding

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.690 
your own that way I can do it holding
still<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.740> I'm<00:03:10.830> seated<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
still so I'm seated but there is

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.960 
still so I'm seated but there is
somewhat<00:03:12.140> reverberation<00:03:13.140> in<00:03:13.260> my<00:03:13.380> body

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
somewhat reverberation in my body

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.160 
somewhat reverberation in my body
whatever<00:03:14.970> you're<00:03:15.180> holding<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.570> your<00:03:15.600> hands<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
whatever you're holding in your hands is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.660 
whatever you're holding in your hands is
part<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.620> weight<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.580> have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
part of your weight and so you just have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.540 
part of your weight and so you just have
to<00:03:17.790> compensate<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.010> being<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.430> your

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
to compensate for for that being in your

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.180 
to compensate for for that being in your
hand<00:03:20.790> when<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.120> lift<00:03:21.360> up<00:03:21.480> your<00:03:21.570> hand<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.920> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
hand when you lift up your hand you you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.130 
hand when you lift up your hand you you
have<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.550> counterbalance<00:03:23.850> back<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.720> little<00:03:24.960> bit

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
have to counterbalance back a little bit

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.780 
have to counterbalance back a little bit
more<00:03:25.350> than<00:03:25.530> normal<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> good<00:03:26.640> way

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
more than normal that's like a good way

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.760 
more than normal that's like a good way
to<00:03:26.850> show<00:03:27.120> weight<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> human<00:03:28.170> body<00:03:28.290> too<00:03:28.650> is

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
to show weight with a human body too is

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.010 
to show weight with a human body too is
when<00:03:28.950> you're<00:03:29.100> gesturing<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.510> point<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
when you're gesturing if I point this

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.920 
when you're gesturing if I point this
way<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.560> lean<00:03:32.160> back<00:03:32.460> a<00:03:32.490> little<00:03:32.670> bit<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
way I lean back a little bit to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.110 
way I lean back a little bit to
compensate<00:03:34.080> for<00:03:34.620> pointing<00:03:34.980> my<00:03:35.580> arms<00:03:35.970> pretty

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
compensate for pointing my arms pretty
