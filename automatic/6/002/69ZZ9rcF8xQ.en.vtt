 This request came to me from the channel 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.820

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.680

 locker Well let's look 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 opened the door and what is us on 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.320
 the top shelf and on the top 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 shampoo and soap for 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
 styling and so on she that is masochki 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 all that sort of ten also 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.050
 there is a fragrance from Avon which is called 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 then y, and I do not like it terribly 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.580
 by smell used as a flavoring in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 tumble down 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.659
 next shelf fresh sticks of course 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 there are shower gels 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.689
 completely different but mostly like 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.549
 see here is in this row ate and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.680
 Jardan Dima series but certainly not all 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.009
 Naturally yes, but here is a row here 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.570
 worth I have is more true and so here 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.790
 shower gel unstick and marsilla 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 which recently acquired already showed 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.159
 video novelties from willow and so on and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.049
 so on and now I want to show you 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.540
 just such a nice little basket here 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.240
 is soap I did not show them to you 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.640
 stocks but here they are i have them 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.350
 very, very different 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.630
 myltse I generally like cripples toned 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 my first that they are cheap secondly 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.670
 many interesting smells and also here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.640
 is located at large exactly 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 initially it was realized as if 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.159
 so to speak a basket under the bombs but 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
 then it turned out that the beginning 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.170
 collect a little soap and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.560
 just about got a sweet basket and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.540
 go to the bottom shelf and how 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 you see here too are gels for 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.220
 soul 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 which is again completely different there is 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.650
 there are new and old fashioned general 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.860
 different, different, there is organic 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 and serious but in general what is not 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 edge just adore you know how 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.840
 how that's so nice to look 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.110
 lockers view your treasures 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.769
 it is very very very very very 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.349
 nice well you know and go to 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.379
 a box above the sink and 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:48.160
 we have two in this department and this 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.200
 exactly my peep here and also 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.150
 is care and cosmetics but here 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.390
 you know what kind of cosmetics is that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 worth stocks then for now 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.859
 we use it here on the very top 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.700
 shelf is hair products 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.730
 shampoo oil and so on on the bottom 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.609
 shelf which is slightly lower 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.150
 facial masks peels and so 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.659
 Further 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.489
 washing gels but you can see on 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.250
 the very lowest I have is 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.349
 also means for the face 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.810
 various masks gels for washing and so 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.120
 further and here is my 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.209
 favorite clip which here using 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.669
 when I wash my face and put it in 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.410
 order and now we are in the room and how 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.849
 could guess of course also 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.910
 there is a cosmetics my toilet 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.650
 little table so let's you 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.599
 we will demonstrate but here and now 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.879
 quite a bit obviously moved 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.150
 some bottle did a little 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.650
 revision yes here of course dark but by the way 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.959
 saying here is not only gels 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.639
 for the soul but for the most part even 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.040
 and body products 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.220
 and at the very bottom I have kept 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.290
 perfume and boxed so better 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.419
 she persists and not at all big 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.699
 part of the cosmetics is in this box 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.040
 First of all, of course, probnichki and then your 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:10.030
 Well, more precisely, miniatures, glasses, various gels 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.879
 for the shower micellar water yes it is already 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.730
 us babies 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.979
 perfume and just here is 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.989
 some stock although recently here 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.960
 it was much bigger and where are you 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.830
 put a plus part of the hand creams 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.970
 which I will attach but on the right 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.759
 I moved here because here 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.460
 lay hands cream for legs in stocks and 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.240
 I moved them here to my new one. 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.520
 pink baxik 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.439
 so here is the packaging all stored 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.780
 even there foot cream 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.250
 Well, such things Well, that's self 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.729
 the last place is not with my 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.189
 care products this is exactly the closet so 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.139
 which I have is in the room but the 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.990
 show you here recently 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.870
 I literally made just such a bun 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.259
 Well, how did I finish it here? 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.979
 let's see you see here is not so paraffin 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.930
 worth the candle and here we set very 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.759
 great what has changed is that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.490
 I used to have perfumes just stood 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.020
 on glass and now i have mated 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.440
 such a foam layer 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.069
 yes and so here now everything looks 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.340
 don't know tell me how you like no 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.680
 therefore, and so it is higher creativity here 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.770
 ladybug 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.379
 but this is the top shelf here 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.250

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.940

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.400
 You see even means and for hair and for 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.270
 body but shower gels and accordingly 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.039
 cream lotions out there hiding Lotion 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.199

 I like it very much and I will order lotions 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.539

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:03.080
 overall I fell in love and now I will buy 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.150

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.310
