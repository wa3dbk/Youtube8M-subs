00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello dear users and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.899
 channel guests keep these 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.019
 with you again and artem carpenters and this is ours 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.630
 regular video programming lesson 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.550
 Pavla in this video tutorial we'll talk 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.460
 about how to create music in a certain 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
 place when we approach him muzochka 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 plays moving away quieter quieter and then 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 In general , this idea disappears 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.189
 suggested the man yesterday here and i did 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.610
 a sketch of such a New Year 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.430
 representations by type here and listen and we 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.940
 the approach begins to play music softly 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.629
 hear yes we come closer music with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.629
 striking step 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:58.250
 it generally plays out loud and waste 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:02.090
 the music subsides and in the end later on 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:07.600
 here we are with you 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.600
 Now we will create and analyze the submission 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:19.490
 as always talk about it on 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 example of a new mod like this clock we all 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.590
 show a clean mod open x inches and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.700
 I'll delete everything 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:37.570
 so that it does not bother you here 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:43.759
 we go completely open is full file new 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.350
 we have created a new mod so in advance 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.890
 I 'll write everything down in my notebook 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.259
 so that 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.180
 it's time to print nothing for a long time 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:56.600
 to occupy and so the object of the Christmas trees of the Christmas trees of the Christmas tree and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.590
 everything else we put in public he is gay 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.590
 fashion and no 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 we insert 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.640
 so here 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.640
 So 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.010
 put objects further go to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:24.510
 public he player 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:28.600
 update and paste the line 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.960
 Now it you make out Tatiana 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.960
 gennadievna 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:45.730
 public he swam here we have this public and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.620
 here we insert a line with music and so 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.660
 Now we will analyze to start 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.660
 let's build a code for the ladder 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.140
 So 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:17.990
 Here and begin to disassemble and sprn 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:23.240
 Rachel point 25 this is our radius 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:26.600
 music I mean at what distance 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.580
 starts playing music i made 25 this 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.860
 that is, here I come up she plays 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.160
 come closer she's louder 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.280
 move back to 25 and the music stops playing 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.220
 These are the coordinates of where your game will play. 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 music is like we did new year 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.950
 representation 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:50.000
 I took the center of this Christmas tree here next 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.750
 goes to the designation music music here's next 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.740
 and audio strip player player id this 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.150
 here it is your musical composition she 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.700
 you must have with 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.060
 mp3 extension at the end otherwise you 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.390
 nothing happens 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.940
 goes again coordinate and again 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.660
 radius 25 radius can change as 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.570
 coordinate 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.520
 then again we have variables again 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.140
 and a share of the chef this is a distance on 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.210
 25 and further goes stop 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.380
 audio stream full player i mean music 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.020
 stops playing all comes in here 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.760
 disassembled with music and with objects this 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.590
 team can then 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.880
 do not pay attention to this is me 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.420
 made for beauty so you can see how 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.750
 changing herringbone at night well just for 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.890
 beauty here and here it can also not 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.870
 change this i made spam to us 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.020
 gives no escape from the first city or 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.990
 met there I don't follow this when 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.840
 I made new coordinates in full 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.840
 next to the Christmas tree here we are 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.690
 compile and make sure of the fact that 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.940
 admin wah hierarch no so we have 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:19.620
 2nd rank then 130 78 unreachable 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:27.290
 code 137 68 how to erase day 137 all 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:33.050
 I understand so remained 156 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:36.570
 let's see that everything is clear here 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.510
 boots it is not for my task errors 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.270
 I hurry and for unnecessary things so that you donâ€™t 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:48.240
 look not needed here we run our 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.710
 game mod and go check wanted 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.520
 wish you all a happy new year 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.760

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.780
 straight time command 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:23.819
 For an hour and night we will set for beauty and 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:26.830
 listen we come music starts playing 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:32.790
 we come closer start starts very 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:36.930
 loud play begin to drift away 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:40.110
 well, quieter quieter quieter and here is the 25th witch 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.020

 that's because well it 's kind of fun 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.700
 will be the fact that its composition begins 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.490
 play and you can also do 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.170
