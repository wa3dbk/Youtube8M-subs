00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.790 
seven eight nine ten
any<00:00:19.950> ten<00:00:20.340> cards<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:20.939> do<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.810> don't<00:00:22.020> care<00:00:22.380> what

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
any ten cards will do we don't care what

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.190 
any ten cards will do we don't care what
the<00:00:22.980> values<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.579> for<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.239> trick<00:00:24.509> we're<00:00:24.960> just

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
the values are for this trick we're just

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.990 
the values are for this trick we're just
going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.560> interested<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.279> whether<00:00:26.489> cards

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
going to be interested in whether cards

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.069 
going to be interested in whether cards
are<00:00:27.270> face<00:00:27.509> up<00:00:27.810> or<00:00:28.050> face<00:00:28.470> down<00:00:29.540> so<00:00:30.540> you<00:00:30.660> begin

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
are face up or face down so you begin

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.440 
are face up or face down so you begin
I'll<00:00:31.680> go<00:00:32.009> through<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> steps<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:33.060> if<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I'll go through the steps here as if I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
I'll go through the steps here as if I
were<00:00:33.780> following<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.380> own<00:00:34.559> instructions<00:00:35.250> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
were following my own instructions so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970 
were following my own instructions so
just<00:00:35.880> find<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> spectator<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> tell<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
just find a spectator and tell them to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.780 
just find a spectator and tell them to
take<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> cards<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.710> turn<00:00:40.710> over<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.310> top<00:00:41.550> two

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
take the cards and turn over the top two

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.390 
take the cards and turn over the top two
cards<00:00:42.060> as<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> pair<00:00:43.260> I'll<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> again

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
cards as a pair I'll do that again

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.110 
cards as a pair I'll do that again
you'll<00:00:45.120> notice<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.720> turn<00:00:45.810> them<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:47.120> they

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you'll notice when I turn them over they

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
you'll notice when I turn them over they
stay<00:00:48.420> together<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.080> a<00:00:49.110> pair<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.790> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
stay together as a pair so that's the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
stay together as a pair so that's the
first<00:00:51.180> step<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.990> second<00:00:52.380> step<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.830> to<00:00:52.890> cut<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
first step the second step is to cut the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.300 
first step the second step is to cut the
packet<00:00:54.450> anywhere<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.380> I'll<00:00:55.500> cut<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> somewhere

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
packet anywhere so I'll cut it somewhere

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.760 
packet anywhere so I'll cut it somewhere
in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.550> middle<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.870> puts<00:00:58.170> those<00:00:58.440> two

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
in the middle and that puts those two

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.620 
in the middle and that puts those two
face-up<00:00:59.130> cards<00:00:59.760> somewhere<00:01:00.750> near<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.620> middle

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
face-up cards somewhere near the middle

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.509 
face-up cards somewhere near the middle
so<00:01:03.630> let's<00:01:03.900> repeat<00:01:04.259> those<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.710> steps<00:01:05.040> now

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so let's repeat those two steps now

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
so let's repeat those two steps now
we're<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> turn<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.590> cards

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
we're going to turn over the two cards

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.630 
we're going to turn over the two cards
that<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.689> pair<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
that are now at the top as a pair and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.380 
that are now at the top as a pair and
then<00:01:11.640> we're<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> cut<00:01:12.390> anywhere<00:01:14.390> now

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
then we're going to cut anywhere now

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
then we're going to cut anywhere now
we're<00:01:15.539> going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.749> continue<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.469> two<00:01:16.770> steps

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
we're going to continue those two steps

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.059 
we're going to continue those two steps
always<00:01:17.819> turning<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.810> top<00:01:18.990> cards<00:01:19.469> as<00:01:19.829> a

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
always turning over the top cards as a

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.999 
always turning over the top cards as a
pair<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.969> cutting<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:22.139> you'll<00:01:22.319> notice<00:01:22.679> this

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pair and cutting now you'll notice this

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.779 
pair and cutting now you'll notice this
time<00:01:23.249> around<00:01:23.639> both<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.780> cards<00:01:25.139> are<00:01:25.700> facing<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
time around both the cards are facing in

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.700 
time around both the cards are facing in
different<00:01:26.819> directions<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> fine<00:01:28.259> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
different directions which is fine so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
different directions which is fine so
I'll<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.369> those<00:01:29.609> over<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:30.119> again<00:01:31.020> I'll

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I'll just turn those over and again I'll

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
I'll just turn those over and again I'll
just<00:01:31.200> cut<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> packet<00:01:32.100> anywhere<00:01:33.170> now<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
just cut the packet anywhere now as it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010 
just cut the packet anywhere now as it
turns<00:01:34.679> out<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.639> are<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.819> couple<00:01:36.119> face<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
turns out there are a couple face up so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.099 
turns out there are a couple face up so
I'll<00:01:37.439> turn<00:01:37.709> those<00:01:38.159> over<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> pair<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.359> cut

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
I'll turn those over as a pair and cut

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.459 
I'll turn those over as a pair and cut
the<00:01:40.229> packet<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.780> over<00:01:43.319> and

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
the packet and we can do this over and

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.949 
the packet and we can do this over and
over<00:01:43.590> again<00:01:43.829> turning<00:01:44.399> over<00:01:44.639> as<00:01:44.999> a<00:01:45.060> pair<00:01:45.749> and

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
over again turning over as a pair and

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.389 
over again turning over as a pair and
cutting<00:01:46.709> I<00:01:47.539> can<00:01:48.539> do<00:01:48.719> this<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.079> many<00:01:49.139> times<00:01:49.529> as<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
cutting I can do this as many times as I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.069 
cutting I can do this as many times as I
want<00:01:51.679> when<00:01:52.679> you're<00:01:52.889> all<00:01:53.069> done<00:01:53.369> doing<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
want when you're all done doing that

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
want when you're all done doing that
you're<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.469> deal<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:56.130> cards<00:01:56.159> into<00:01:56.939> two

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you're going to deal the cards into two

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.699 
you're going to deal the cards into two
piles<00:01:57.709> left<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:59.039> right<00:02:00.139> like<00:02:01.139> this

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
piles left and right like this

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.309 
piles left and right like this
now<00:02:02.490> you'll<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.880> summer<00:02:03.209> face<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.810> summer

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
now you'll see summer face up summer

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.339 
now you'll see summer face up summer
face<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:06.119> last<00:02:06.299> step<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.929> to<00:02:06.959> take

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
face down the last step is to take

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.940 
face down the last step is to take
either<00:02:08.190> pile<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> turn<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.810> drop<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
either pile and turn it over and drop it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.330 
either pile and turn it over and drop it
on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.819> other<00:02:11.970> pile<00:02:12.650> now<00:02:13.650> you're<00:02:13.920> ready<00:02:14.130> for

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
on the other pile now you're ready for

on the other pile now you're ready for
the<00:02:14.460> big<00:02:14.640> revelation<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.960> even<00:02:16.530> though<00:02:16.740> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the big revelation because even though I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.559 
the big revelation because even though I
can't<00:02:17.490> see<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.120> doing

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
can't see what you're doing

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.199 
can't see what you're doing
because<00:02:19.409> you're<00:02:19.530> doing<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.129> home<00:02:20.209> I'll

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
because you're doing this at home I'll

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.330 
because you're doing this at home I'll
predict<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:21.989> many<00:02:22.170> cards<00:02:22.469> are<00:02:22.709> face<00:02:22.889> up<00:02:23.189> in

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
predict how many cards are face up in

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.720 
predict how many cards are face up in
how<00:02:23.639> many<00:02:23.939> cards<00:02:24.209> are<00:02:24.540> face<00:02:24.870> down<00:02:25.340> let's<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.549> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
how many cards are face down let's see I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.179 
how many cards are face down let's see I
think<00:02:27.209> there<00:02:27.389> are<00:02:27.420> five<00:02:27.749> cards<00:02:28.260> face<00:02:28.709> up<00:02:28.739> in

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
think there are five cards face up in

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.369 
think there are five cards face up in
five<00:02:29.549> cards<00:02:30.030> face<00:02:30.299> down<00:02:30.329> let's<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.109> if<00:02:31.230> I'm

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
five cards face down let's see if I'm

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.420 
five cards face down let's see if I'm
right<00:02:31.409> and<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.999> fact<00:02:33.139> I<00:02:34.139> am<00:02:34.530> right<00:02:34.859> there<00:02:35.310> are

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
right and in fact I am right there are

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.690 
right and in fact I am right there are
three<00:02:35.790> four<00:02:36.359> five<00:02:36.780> cards<00:02:37.230> face<00:02:37.469> up<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.920> five

three four five cards face up and five

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.069 
three four five cards face up and five
cards<00:02:39.150> face<00:02:39.719> down<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.349> that's<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.909> ten<00:02:42.659> card

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079
