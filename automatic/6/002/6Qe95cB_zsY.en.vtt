two is B see a branched chain amino
acids<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.299> from<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> foods<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
acids we get these from the foods that

acids we get these from the foods that
we<00:01:55.200> eat<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.280> happens<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.119> take

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
we eat but what happens is if you take

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.480 
we eat but what happens is if you take
these<00:01:57.630> post-workout<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.219> take<00:01:59.369> these

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
these post-workout you take these

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.539 
these post-workout you take these
post-workout<00:02:00.170> 7/2<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> way

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
post-workout 7/2 you can do all the way

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.840 
post-workout 7/2 you can do all the way
up<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> 15<00:02:03.240> grams<00:02:03.600> post-workout<00:02:04.520> what<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> does

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
up to 15 grams post-workout what it does

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.249 
up to 15 grams post-workout what it does
is<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.899> prolongs<00:02:07.619> fatigue<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.629> rate<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is is it prolongs fatigue so the rate to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.470 
is is it prolongs fatigue so the rate to
perceived<00:02:10.860> exertion<00:02:11.420> extend

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
perceived exertion extend

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240

can actually drink them into your

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.339 
can actually drink them into your
training<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> fact<00:02:30.269> I've<00:02:30.450> done<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.780> I've<00:02:31.290> done

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
training in fact I've done it I've done

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.440 
training in fact I've done it I've done
it<00:02:31.590> quite<00:02:31.830> often<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:33.200> 2/3<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.560> half<00:02:35.450> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it quite often so that's 2/3 is half a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:45.610 
it quite often so that's 2/3 is half a
banana<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:39.470> 1<00:02:40.670> spoon<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:42.440> almond<00:02:43.440> butter

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.039 

alright<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.910> very<00:02:48.120> good<00:02:48.209> this

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
alright this is this is very good this

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.809 
alright this is this is very good this
is<00:02:49.170> another<00:02:49.349> another<00:02:49.860> way<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.700> other

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
is another another way now the other

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.520 
is another another way now the other
thing<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.299> do<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.290> combine

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
thing that you can do is you can combine

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.890 
thing that you can do is you can combine
these<00:02:52.859> things<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:54.150> know<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.690> doesn't

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
these things so you know if this doesn't

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.509 
these things so you know if this doesn't
work<00:02:55.079> all<00:02:55.319> by<00:02:55.349> itself<00:02:55.799> or<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.129> need<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> little

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
work all by itself or you need a little

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.800 
work all by itself or you need a little
bit<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.120> go<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.750> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
bit more you can go here and then you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.479 
bit more you can go here and then you
can<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.079> here<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.799> use<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> combination

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
can go here so you can use a combination

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.020 
can go here so you can use a combination
of<00:03:00.000> these<00:03:00.150> things<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.629> will<00:03:01.290> say<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:02.670> often

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
of these things I will say more often

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.580 
of these things I will say more often
than<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:03.209> this<00:03:03.629> question<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.140> comes<00:03:04.260> from

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
than not this question it comes from

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.470 
than not this question it comes from
from<00:03:05.129> those<00:03:05.280> who<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.489> training<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.030> fasted

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
from those who are training in a fasted

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
from those who are training in a fasted
state<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.500> there's<00:03:07.709> some<00:03:07.890> major

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
state and and so there's some major

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.789 
state and and so there's some major
benefits<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.540> training<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.019> fasted<00:03:10.349> state<00:03:10.410> I

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
benefits to training in a fasted state I

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.430 
benefits to training in a fasted state I
don't<00:03:11.549> train<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.060> way<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:13.140> certainly

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
don't train that way but certainly

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
don't train that way but certainly
there's<00:03:13.799> some<00:03:13.920> advantages<00:03:14.400> which<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.760> another

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
there's some advantages which is another

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.690 
there's some advantages which is another
topic<00:03:15.750> for<00:03:16.170> another<00:03:16.230> video<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.519> you're

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
topic for another video but if you're

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
topic for another video but if you're
training<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> fasted<00:03:18.480> state<00:03:18.690> maybe<00:03:19.019> you

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
training in a fasted state maybe you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
training in a fasted state maybe you
want<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> leave<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.799> one<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:21.030> get<00:03:21.150> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
want to leave this one out to get the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.330 
want to leave this one out to get the
full<00:03:21.480> benefits<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.049> training<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.919> way<00:03:23.069> and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
full benefits of training that way and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.039 
full benefits of training that way and
then<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.970> stick<00:03:24.120> with<00:03:24.269> number<00:03:24.510> one<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.900> two

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
then just stick with number one and two
