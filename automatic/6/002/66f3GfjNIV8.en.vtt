00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Dick 8 last Thursday if you are whole 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.080
 satisfied further you would of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.509
 then hope that want to continue 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 Sunday afternoon and I think it worked out yes 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.740
 without team very very very eager 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.110
 sat yesterday at the training with the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 play position that she played very eagerly 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 they just seem like a loss of trees 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 almost seeing often can see how they get it out 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.789
 then she came 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.130
 I did see to the at the end 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.510
 players were pretty through it but that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.769
 makes sense because it costs a lot 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 a lot of force 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.519
 but again if you have a 2000 almost none 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.289
 give away chance 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 no matter the ruin then plays 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 we really have a concentrated group 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.360
 it is a pure tiredness of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 for example, mark van bommel that in one 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 Fifteen minutes before the name change but 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 his knee also suffers a bit 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 and so that made sense to put it there for a moment 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.170
 lash out with me that the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170
 first half becomes better than the second 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 yes something else is something else but the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.219
 In the second half we can also extend to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.750
 a 560 that chance we get a yes that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.890
 we don't use it when we are six 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 going through saying to the second 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 otherwise also interesting so we have 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.799
 the opportunity that govern has not exploited 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 but as a team we are very depressed 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.290
 well done by actually not doing anything 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.580
 to give 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 I thought it would fall again for interesting 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 but from the first better yes good in terms of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.930
 game sun was true that many young people are 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.790
 are now leaving for them next week 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.590
 national team that is pleasant for that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.189
 Do n't please me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.619
 because another four or five men and that is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 very annoying but yes that is the can 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.409
 they do and then I don't want to do anything 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.420
 so they have to do it for the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 let 's do national teams again 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 because he always comes back 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.799
 wait again 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.689
 we have just one positive side 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 different environment other people don't care about you 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 doubt but because because it's just so 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.979
 that everyone is very happy for 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 national team come and rightly so too 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.220
 you can do good business this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
 weekend but I leave some on it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.700
 moment we are talking, you have to get used to it 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 still play against az 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.450
 yes but that is where of course plays 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.280
 but also it is important that we ourselves 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 we think we are no more nor 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.100
 good series and then we have to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 and it goes on one 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.799
 that coin goes with convincing way 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.890
 happiness so yes we are still really 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.890
 satisfied with it
