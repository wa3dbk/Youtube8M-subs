00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.690
 million application 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.750
 I already put here a distance of some 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.670
 even feeling in the other 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.869
 I centralized but I was using 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.710
 10 million in that part will be 10 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:40.730
 millions do not measure the other arrow all 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:40.730

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 I will vote using this material here 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:48.090
 O owner can be a square but I 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 I believe it will give another charm 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.130

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 block out the sun from the mbaca out but one 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.239
 material that is more resistant than 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 this pvc should be very good too 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.040
 but there are others that leave charm but nÃ© 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.190
 this curtain here to vote using is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.950
 this part as a lining and come back doing 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 another part in roll that gives more 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.580
 charm and elegance 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:03:00.030
 we have to be well centered the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:03:00.030
 ask the circumference to be perfect 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.910

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:23.530
 efe but some others to endure the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:30.269
 lake in the mail the customer has to give 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.269
 another show in the format of u 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.080

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.300
 This fit here for sure. 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 put on the right side 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:17.850
 this is what makes a stranger if not who 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:22.890
 Hey, is everyone in the process? 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:26.730
 people think that here needs 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.010
 machine has such a machine but still 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.720
 we are not prepared to acquire 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:40.950
 going but who knows the passer-by right? 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:43.590
 very end of the year the most in speed 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:54.770
 process because they actually work 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:54.770
 even vote 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.320
 He does not work alone in hurting himself. 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.030
 I'll see you soon if I can do it here. 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:31.610
 day all day movement no more 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.610
 when you have fibromyalgia and are ready 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.960
 I'm finishing here. 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.370
 they were just for you to see how it is 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.950
 it's nice 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.460
 and another thing it looks like 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:12.050
 kneaded but in three days four days 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.050
 in place before the picadinha 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.340
