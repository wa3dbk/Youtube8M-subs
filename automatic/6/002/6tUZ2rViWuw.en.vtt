notice I just restored my hood emblem
right<00:00:15.240> there<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.660> kind<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.870> cool<00:00:16.160> matches

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
right there it's kind of cool matches

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.890 
right there it's kind of cool matches
the<00:00:17.279> car<00:00:17.490> actually<00:00:17.789> looks<00:00:18.029> better<00:00:18.270> than<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the car actually looks better than the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.730 
the car actually looks better than the
car<00:00:19.140> does<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.400> its<00:00:20.520> current<00:00:20.910> state<00:00:21.260> but<00:00:22.260> where

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
car does in its current state but where

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939 
car does in its current state but where
we<00:00:22.890> left<00:00:23.100> off<00:00:23.310> last<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.930> was<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> exhaust<00:00:25.529> we

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we left off last time was the exhaust we

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.380 
we left off last time was the exhaust we
had<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> big<00:00:26.340> snow<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.939> year

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
had a big snow this year

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
had a big snow this year
and<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:28.140> backed<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.680> driveway<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and I backed out of my driveway and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.709 
and I backed out of my driveway and
ripped<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> exhaust<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.719> temporary

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
ripped the exhaust off the temporary

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.430 
ripped the exhaust off the temporary
exhaust<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.399> using<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.960> here

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
exhaust that I was using is right here

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
exhaust that I was using is right here
it<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.070> raspy<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> loud<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> didn't<00:00:40.140> care

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
it was raspy and loud and I didn't care

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.310 
it was raspy and loud and I didn't care
for<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.670> but<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:42.300> gave<00:00:42.540> me<00:00:42.570> an<00:00:42.719> idea<00:00:43.020> is

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
for it but what gave me an idea is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
for it but what gave me an idea is
notice<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.090> Honda<00:00:45.539> 600<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.920> 2<00:00:47.309> cylinder<00:00:47.879> has

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
notice the Honda 600 is a 2 cylinder has

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.119 
notice the Honda 600 is a 2 cylinder has
two<00:00:48.930> pipes<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.809> effectively<00:00:52.129> split

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
two pipes into one I effectively split

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
two pipes into one I effectively split
that<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> made<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.600> dual<00:00:54.750> exhaust<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.739> lot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that and made it dual exhaust a lot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
that and made it dual exhaust a lot
further<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> I'll<00:00:56.940> show<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> second

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
further and I'll show you in a second

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.650 
further and I'll show you in a second
what<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.199> did<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.730> wanted<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> retain<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
what I did so I wanted to retain the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.479 
what I did so I wanted to retain the
heat<00:01:00.750> exchanger<00:01:01.170> because<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.440> gets<00:01:01.590> cold<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
heat exchanger because it gets cold here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030 
heat exchanger because it gets cold here
in<00:01:02.609> Oregon<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.559> stock<00:01:04.769> heat

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
in Oregon so I have the stock heat

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.289 
in Oregon so I have the stock heat
exchanger<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> fan<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
exchanger I don't have the fan in here

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
exchanger I don't have the fan in here
it's<00:01:06.420> better<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.930> demonstration<00:01:07.530> purposes

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's better for demonstration purposes

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.810 
it's better for demonstration purposes
but<00:01:08.820> where<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.630> Y<00:01:10.320> pipe<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.820> ya

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
but where that Y pipe is get that for ya

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
but where that Y pipe is get that for ya
where<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.920> set<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:18.350> right<00:01:19.350> here

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
where this was set that down right here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.880 
where this was set that down right here
I<00:01:19.860> split<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> manifold<00:01:21.060> okay<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> camera

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I split the manifold okay get the camera

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.050 
I split the manifold okay get the camera
in<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:23.939> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
in there see if you can see it see it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.890 
in there see if you can see it see it's
dual<00:01:24.479> pipes<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> goes<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
dual pipes as it goes down and that

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
dual pipes as it goes down and that
makes<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.020> huge<00:01:28.380> difference<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:29.009> can't<00:01:29.369> believe

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
makes a huge difference I can't believe

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.990 
makes a huge difference I can't believe
it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
it
so<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> did<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> tell<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.950> don't<00:01:32.070> know

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so what I did you can tell I don't know

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.350 
so what I did you can tell I don't know
if<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.369> tell<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
if you can tell but you can see the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.870 
if you can tell but you can see the
pipes<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> through<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> grille<00:01:34.439> there

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
pipes kind of through the grille there

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.910 
pipes kind of through the grille there
clean<00:01:35.880> those<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.119> clean<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> ports<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
clean those up clean the ports the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
clean those up clean the ports the
exhaust<00:01:38.250> ports<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> carbon<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.890> sealed<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
exhaust ports of carbon and sealed and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.999 
exhaust ports of carbon and sealed and
painted<00:01:41.630> flattened<00:01:42.630> made<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.770> there's<00:01:43.890> no

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
painted flattened made sure there's no

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
painted flattened made sure there's no
leaks<00:01:44.220> made<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> gasket<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.470> split<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
leaks made a gasket there split the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.420 
leaks made a gasket there split the
manifold<00:01:47.040> ran<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.460> pipes<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.329> then

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
manifold ran two pipes down and then

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.469 
manifold ran two pipes down and then
underneath<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> car<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.450> my

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
underneath the car I'm gonna get on my

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
underneath the car I'm gonna get on my
fancy<00:01:51.899> dancy<00:01:52.229> creeper<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.220> show

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fancy dancy creeper here so I can show

fancy dancy creeper here so I can show
you<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:53.670> underneath

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.330 

I<00:01:57.120> got<00:01:58.120> two<00:01:58.330> pipes<00:01:58.600> coming<00:01:58.960> down<00:01:59.130> see<00:02:00.130> that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
I got two pipes coming down see that

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.690 
I got two pipes coming down see that
they're<00:02:01.260> their<00:02:02.260> dual<00:02:02.530> exhaust<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.100> put<00:02:03.280> flanges

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
they're their dual exhaust I put flanges

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.800 
they're their dual exhaust I put flanges
