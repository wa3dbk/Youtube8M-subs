what I want to talk today talk about

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.079 
what I want to talk today talk about
today<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> relative<00:00:04.799> major<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.339> minors<00:00:05.759> now

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
today is a relative major and minors now

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.120 
today is a relative major and minors now
every<00:00:06.660> major<00:00:06.960> chord<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.649> play<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.069> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
every major chord that you play in a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.310 
every major chord that you play in a
song<00:00:08.429> has<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> relative<00:00:09.690> minor<00:00:09.870> every<00:00:10.139> major

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
song has a relative minor every major

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.749 
song has a relative minor every major
chord<00:00:10.559> has<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> relative<00:00:11.070> minor<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.519> it's

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
chord has a relative minor and it's

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.640 
chord has a relative minor and it's
really<00:00:11.969> important<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> know<00:00:12.570> their<00:00:13.139> peers<00:00:13.349> so

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
really important to know their peers so

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880 
really important to know their peers so
so<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.940> we're<00:00:15.089> discussing<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.590> least<00:00:16.740> two

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
so what we're discussing is at least two

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.429 
so what we're discussing is at least two
chords<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.670> its<00:00:18.029> relative<00:00:18.420> minor<00:00:18.449> F<00:00:19.140> sharp

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
chords a and its relative minor F sharp

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.509 
chords a and its relative minor F sharp
minor<00:00:19.619> now<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.820> work<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
minor now how do you work it out that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.040 
minor now how do you work it out that
the<00:00:23.519> chords<00:00:23.789> are<00:00:23.880> related<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.720> example

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the chords are related so for example

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.839 
the chords are related so for example
you<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.410> an<00:00:25.500> f-sharp<00:00:25.680> minor<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> page<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
you see an f-sharp minor on a page and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.070 
you see an f-sharp minor on a page and
you're<00:00:26.939> trying<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> work<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.480> its<00:00:27.660> relative

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
you're trying to work out its relative

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.740 
you're trying to work out its relative
major<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.880> count<00:00:30.660> on

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
major what you do is you do count on

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.630 
major what you do is you do count on
through<00:00:30.900> 17<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.590> hit<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:32.040> F<00:00:32.189> sharp<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
through 17 so for hit from F sharp you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
through 17 so for hit from F sharp you
go<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.540> three<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.530> remember

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
go one two three or you can remember

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.510 
go one two three or you can remember
this<00:00:34.920> thing<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.870> sky<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> sky

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this thing up in the sky up in the sky

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.319 
this thing up in the sky up in the sky
and<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:40.460> okay<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.879> F<00:00:42.090> sharp

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and you get to a okay so from F sharp

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
and you get to a okay so from F sharp
you<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> sky<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you go up in the sky and you get to a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
you go up in the sky and you get to a
and<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.660> relative<00:00:46.230> major<00:00:46.500> now

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and that's it's relative major now

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.529 
and that's it's relative major now
what's<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> significance<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.360> why

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
what's the significance of that so why

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
what's the significance of that so why
do<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.719> need<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.649> F<00:00:49.800> sharp

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
do we need to know that well F sharp

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
do we need to know that well F sharp
minor<00:00:50.660> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> play<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> want

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
minor if you want to play it if you want

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
minor if you want to play it if you want
to<00:00:53.039> make<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.280> F<00:00:53.430> sharp<00:00:53.670> minor<00:00:53.820> sound<00:00:54.090> more

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to make your F sharp minor sound more

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.200 
to make your F sharp minor sound more
modern<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.350> change<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> F<00:00:56.039> sharp

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
modern you can change it to F sharp

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.380 
modern you can change it to F sharp
minor<00:00:57.210> seven<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:59.340> modern<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
minor seven so that's more modern it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
minor seven so that's more modern it
doesn't<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.809> such<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> minor<00:01:01.800> sound<00:01:02.010> an<00:01:02.190> F

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
doesn't have such a minor sound an F

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.899 
doesn't have such a minor sound an F
sharp<00:01:02.399> minor<00:01:02.789> seven<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:04.320> played<00:01:04.619> as

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
sharp minor seven is really played as

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.420 
sharp minor seven is really played as
camera<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.180> played<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.920> over<00:01:07.920> F<00:01:08.130> sharp

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
camera can be played as a over F sharp

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.929 
camera can be played as a over F sharp
so<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.830> see<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.920> F<00:01:11.040> sharp<00:01:11.070> minor<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> page

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
so if you see an F sharp minor on a page

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.750 
so if you see an F sharp minor on a page
and<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:13.049> end<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.010> playing<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.340> F<00:01:14.430> sharp<00:01:14.640> minor

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and you end up playing an F sharp minor

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
and you end up playing an F sharp minor
like<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> hear<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> sound<00:01:17.189> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
like this you can hear that the sound is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
like this you can hear that the sound is
sad<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> traditional<00:01:18.750> minor

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
sad it's just a traditional minor

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
sad it's just a traditional minor
classical<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.950> -<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> change

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
classical kind of - so but if you change

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.560 
classical kind of - so but if you change
that<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.020> hand<00:01:22.229> cord<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.770> chord

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
that right hand cord to an a chord

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
that right hand cord to an a chord
you<00:01:24.570> hear<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> slightly<00:01:25.650> brighter<00:01:26.070> feel

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you hear it has a slightly brighter feel

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
you hear it has a slightly brighter feel
it's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> set<00:01:27.030> has<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.170> modern<00:01:28.500> feel

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's not a set has a more modern feel

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.499 
it's not a set has a more modern feel
and<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.549> an<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.820> chord<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> play<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and so that's an a chord I can play to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.410 
and so that's an a chord I can play to
reposition<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.670> F<00:01:32.909> sharp<00:01:33.210> minor

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
reposition and that's F sharp minor

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.240 
reposition and that's F sharp minor
seven<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.140> three<00:01:34.380> five

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
seven one three five

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.530 
seven one three five
7.now<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.490> good<00:01:38.420> exercise<00:01:38.900> is<00:01:39.320> play<00:01:40.160> a<00:01:40.550> bunch<00:01:41.390> of

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
7.now a good exercise is play a bunch of

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.580 
7.now a good exercise is play a bunch of
but<00:01:41.750> bars<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.520> F<00:01:43.970> sharp<00:01:44.030> minor<00:01:44.630> together

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
but bars of a and F sharp minor together

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.320 
but bars of a and F sharp minor together
so<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.130> know<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.550> do<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.820> over<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.240> over

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
so you know just do this over and over

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.880 
so you know just do this over and over
and<00:01:47.720> see<00:01:48.290> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.470> can<00:01:48.590> come<00:01:48.770> up<00:01:48.800> with

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and see if you can come up with

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.400 
and see if you can come up with
something<00:01:49.310> interesting<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.360> going<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.290> F

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
something interesting so a going to F

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.020 
something interesting so a going to F
sharp<00:01:51.650> minor<00:01:51.800> something<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.790> use<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
sharp minor something like this use a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.260 
sharp minor something like this use a
dotted<00:01:53.390> crotchet<00:01:53.480> rhythm<00:01:53.900> so<00:01:54.080> we're<00:01:54.200> going

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
dotted crotchet rhythm so we're going

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.880 
dotted crotchet rhythm so we're going
one<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.310> three<00:01:58.330> four<00:01:59.330> then<00:01:59.780> F<00:02:00.080> sharp<00:02:00.140> minor

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
one and three four then F sharp minor

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.170 
one and three four then F sharp minor
I'm<00:02:01.070> still<00:02:01.280> playing<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.670> chord

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
I'm still playing a chord

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.920 
I'm still playing a chord
so<00:02:02.810> with<00:02:02.990> some<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.320> two<00:02:03.380> years<00:02:03.830> back<00:02:04.730> to<00:02:04.880> my<00:02:05.000> a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.360 

now<00:02:10.930> you'll<00:02:11.140> notice<00:02:11.320> I'm<00:02:11.530> playing<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:12.130> in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
now you'll notice I'm playing that be in

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.010 
now you'll notice I'm playing that be in
there<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.030> before<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.390> get<00:02:13.480> too<00:02:13.630> far<00:02:13.660> ahead<00:02:13.930> of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
there so before we get too far ahead of

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.380 
there so before we get too far ahead of
ourselves<00:02:14.200> let<00:02:14.830> me<00:02:15.220> explain<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
ourselves let me explain to you the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.880 
ourselves let me explain to you the
rhythm<00:02:16.660> pattern<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.050> I'm<00:02:17.170> using<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.590> those

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
rhythm pattern that I'm using for those

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.580 
rhythm pattern that I'm using for those
of<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.220> who<00:02:18.430> are<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.930> familiar<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.440> this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
of you who are not familiar with this

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.530 
of you who are not familiar with this
server<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.100> really<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:21.550> playing<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.210> dotted

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
server so really I'm playing a dotted

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.640 
server so really I'm playing a dotted
crotchet<00:02:23.730> one<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.060> two<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.660> three<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.590> four

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
crotchet one and two and three and four

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.540 
crotchet one and two and three and four
and<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.360> four<00:02:29.070> there's<00:02:30.070> another<00:02:30.280> core

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
and and on the four there's another core

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.490 
and and on the four there's another core
there<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.910> we're<00:02:34.060> doing<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.140> pet<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.410> on

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the left hand using my root and then the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.800 
the left hand using my root and then the
fifth<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.100> then<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.460> root<00:02:39.670> again<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.510> an<00:02:40.630> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
fifth and then the root again so in an a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
fifth and then the root again so in an a
chord<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.470> example<00:02:41.860> I'm<00:02:42.100> playing<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.960> in

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
chord for example I'm playing a a and in

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.100 
chord for example I'm playing a a and in
an<00:02:44.950> F<00:02:45.160> sharp<00:02:45.400> minor<00:02:45.520> chord<00:02:45.670> I'll<00:02:45.940> play<00:02:46.150> F<00:02:46.660> sharp

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
an F sharp minor chord I'll play F sharp

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.730 
an F sharp minor chord I'll play F sharp
C<00:02:47.500> sharp<00:02:47.530> F<00:02:47.920> sharp<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> first<00:02:50.080> bar<00:02:50.290> then

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
C sharp F sharp a for the first bar then

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.100 
C sharp F sharp a for the first bar then
F<00:02:51.130> sharp<00:02:51.490> C<00:02:51.760> sharp<00:02:51.790> F<00:02:52.180> sharp<00:02:52.330> for<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.810> second

F sharp C sharp F sharp for the second

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.530 
F sharp C sharp F sharp for the second
bar<00:02:53.230> now<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:53.950> chord<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.000> first<00:02:55.240> quarter

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
bar now in the a chord the first quarter

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.480 
bar now in the a chord the first quarter
play<00:02:55.690> might<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:56.020> say<00:02:56.230> let's<00:02:57.070> say<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.310> do<00:02:57.460> a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
play might be say let's say we do a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.940 
play might be say let's say we do a
plane<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.030> C<00:02:58.690> sharp<00:02:58.900> E<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.230> we're<00:02:59.350> doing<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.650> plane

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
plane a C sharp E so we're doing a plane

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.750 
plane a C sharp E so we're doing a plane
root<00:03:00.880> position<00:03:01.000> okay<00:03:01.960> so<00:03:02.020> there<00:03:02.230> will<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.760> C

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
root position okay so there will be a C

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.970 
root position okay so there will be a C
sharp<00:03:04.000> E<00:03:04.210> but<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> second<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> second

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
sharp E but in the second in the second

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.710 
sharp E but in the second in the second
sort<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.760> voicing<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.180> don't<00:03:07.450> want<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.630> play

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
sort of voicing I don't want to play

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.000 
sort of voicing I don't want to play
exactly<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> same<00:03:08.290> thing<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.800> don't

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
exactly the same thing because I don't

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.500 
exactly the same thing because I don't
want<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> play<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.520> three<00:03:09.730> times<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.420> I'm

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
want to play that three times so I'm

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.790 
want to play that three times so I'm
just<00:03:10.660> putting<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.020> major<00:03:11.230> second<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.710> I'm

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
just putting the major second in I'm

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.060 
just putting the major second in I'm
putting<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.070> two<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.550> there<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.420> one<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.440> two

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
putting the two in there so one and two

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.920 
putting the two in there so one and two
and<00:03:15.430> three<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.420> four<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:18.190> will<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.790> B<00:03:19.660> E

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and three and four so this will be a B E

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.800 
and three and four so this will be a B E
and<00:03:20.440> that'll<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.580> B<00:03:22.180> e<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.450> an<00:03:25.570> a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
and that'll be a B e really it's an a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.780 
and that'll be a B e really it's an a
chord<00:03:26.140> but<00:03:26.530> but<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> mean<00:03:27.040> technically<00:03:27.730> we

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
chord but but I mean technically we

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.610 
chord but but I mean technically we
could<00:03:28.030> call<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.300> an<00:03:28.360> A<00:03:28.540> two<00:03:28.870> chord<00:03:29.200> okay

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
could call it an A two chord okay

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.080 
could call it an A two chord okay
because<00:03:29.800> it's<00:03:30.010> got<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.220> be<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.670> these<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
because it's got to be in it these the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.640 
because it's got to be in it these the
two<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.959> second<00:03:32.230> note<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.560> scale

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
two of a it's a second note in the scale

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.610 
two of a it's a second note in the scale
of<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.100> major<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:34.320> by<00:03:35.320> doing<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:37.440> by<00:03:38.440> doing

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
of a major so by doing that by doing

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.870 
of a major so by doing that by doing
that<00:03:38.740> it<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.130> sounds<00:03:41.490> like<00:03:42.490> something's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
that it just sounds like something's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.280 
that it just sounds like something's
changing<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.510> middle<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.810> bar

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.199 

I<00:03:46.319> can<00:03:47.099> play<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.519> different<00:03:47.670> inversion<00:03:48.150> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
I can play it in a different inversion I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.309 
I can play it in a different inversion I
don't<00:03:48.360> have<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.569> play<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.810> root<00:03:49.170> position

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
don't have to play the root position

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.830 
don't have to play the root position
like<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.950> ACH<00:03:50.430> RP<00:03:50.760> I've<00:03:50.909> been<00:03:51.030> played<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
like this ACH RP I've been played be a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.289 
like this ACH RP I've been played be a
c-sharp<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:53.940> go<00:03:54.120> like<00:03:54.150> this

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
c-sharp and we and it would go like this

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:01.130 
c-sharp and we and it would go like this
one<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.110> two<00:03:58.909> and<00:03:59.909> then<00:04:00.629> when<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.840> use<00:04:01.110> that

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
one and two and then when I use that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.140 
one and two and then when I use that
other<00:04:01.500> rule<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.400> said<00:04:02.640> when<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.879> see<00:04:03.060> an

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
other rule that I said when you see an

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.970 
other rule that I said when you see an
f-sharp<00:04:03.390> minor<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:04.379> count<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.769> three

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
f-sharp minor we count up three

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.710 
f-sharp minor we count up three
semitones<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.420> guy<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.349> chord<00:04:07.950> is

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
semitones up in this guy and a chord is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.240 
semitones up in this guy and a chord is
what<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> can<00:04:09.989> play<00:04:10.170> over<00:04:10.590> an<00:04:10.680> f-sharp<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.129> when

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
what I can play over an f-sharp so when

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.069 
what I can play over an f-sharp so when
I<00:04:11.280> see<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.610> F<00:04:11.730> sharp<00:04:11.760> minor<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.269> can<00:04:12.450> literally

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
I see that F sharp minor I can literally

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.720 
I see that F sharp minor I can literally
play<00:04:13.290> exactly<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.069> same<00:04:14.250> thing<00:04:14.459> in<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.610> right

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
play exactly the same thing in the right

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.060 
play exactly the same thing in the right
hand<00:04:15.030> but<00:04:15.360> my<00:04:15.510> left<00:04:15.750> hand<00:04:16.019> won't<00:04:16.590> be<00:04:16.680> playing<00:04:16.889> a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
hand but my left hand won't be playing a

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.969 
hand but my left hand won't be playing a
EA<00:04:17.340> anymore<00:04:17.850> it'll<00:04:18.090> be<00:04:18.180> playing<00:04:18.479> F<00:04:19.289> sharp<00:04:19.739> C

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
EA anymore it'll be playing F sharp C

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.219 
EA anymore it'll be playing F sharp C
sharp<00:04:20.010> F<00:04:20.370> sharp<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.880> it'll<00:04:21.150> now<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.419> going<00:04:21.720> one

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
sharp F sharp so it'll now be going one

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.879 
sharp F sharp so it'll now be going one
two<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.270> first<00:04:24.510> bar<00:04:24.780> then<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.560> change

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
two this is the first bar then I change

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.719 
two this is the first bar then I change
my<00:04:26.010> left<00:04:26.190> hand<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:29.100> then<00:04:29.280> back<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.610> first

my left hand and then back to the first

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.270 
my left hand and then back to the first
bar<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:31.020> as<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.229> good<00:04:31.470> exercise<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:32.250> I

bar so as a good exercise what I

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.610 
bar so as a good exercise what I
recommend<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:32.789> doing<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.270> do<00:04:34.199> a<00:04:34.260> little<00:04:34.470> bit

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
recommend you doing is do a little bit

recommend you doing is do a little bit
of<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.180> changing<00:04:36.180> version<00:04:40.550> try<00:04:41.550> all<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
of this changing version try all the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.879 
of this changing version try all the
different<00:04:41.910> versions<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:43.590> haven't<00:04:43.800> done

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
different versions of a we haven't done

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.899 
different versions of a we haven't done
this<00:04:44.039> one

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.709 

then<00:04:50.909> mess<00:04:51.179> it<00:04:51.330> up<00:04:52.639> now<00:04:53.639> if<00:04:53.939> once<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.479> get<00:04:54.629> the

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719 
then mess it up now if once you get the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.659 
then mess it up now if once you get the
hang<00:04:54.749> of<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.259> can<00:04:55.349> try<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:56.189> vary<00:04:56.490> the

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
hang of this you can try to vary the

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:04.929 
hang of this you can try to vary the
rhythm<00:04:56.849> a<00:04:57.089> little<00:04:57.330> bit<00:05:00.110> break<00:05:01.110> up<00:05:01.259> some<00:05:01.469> notes

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:19.400 

put<00:05:05.939> in<00:05:06.059> some<00:05:06.240> fillers

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.020 

and<00:05:20.410> after<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.830> do<00:05:20.950> that<00:05:20.980> enough<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.610> you

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
and after you do that enough that you

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.360 
and after you do that enough that you
get<00:05:22.300> thoroughly<00:05:22.840> familiar<00:05:23.020> with<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.590> you'll

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
get thoroughly familiar with a you'll

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.340 
get thoroughly familiar with a you'll
start<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.850> associate<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.230> F

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
start to associate the a with the F

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.020 
start to associate the a with the F
chart<00:05:26.500> -<00:05:26.860> every<00:05:27.100> time<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.310> see<00:05:27.460> f-sharp<00:05:27.640> money

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030

chart - every time you see f-sharp money
you're<00:05:28.210> thinking<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.110> right<00:05:29.290> hand<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.560> in

you're thinking a in the right hand a in
the<00:05:29.860> right<00:05:30.040> hand<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:30.880> you're<00:05:31.810> learning

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
the right hand and so you're learning

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.630 
the right hand and so you're learning
your<00:05:32.380> cause<00:05:32.590> in<00:05:32.740> pairs<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.220> because<00:05:33.460> there's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
your cause in pairs and because there's

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.090 
your cause in pairs and because there's
12<00:05:33.790> different<00:05:34.240> keys<00:05:34.600> on<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.020> piano<00:05:35.170> or<00:05:35.500> in<00:05:35.980> any

instrument that matter you just need to

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.620 
instrument that matter you just need to
learn<00:05:38.710> 12<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.520> these<00:05:39.700> and<00:05:40.030> you've<00:05:40.240> knocked<00:05:40.450> out

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
learn 12 of these and you've knocked out

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.570 
learn 12 of these and you've knocked out
all<00:05:40.840> your<00:05:41.290> majors<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:41.950> your<00:05:42.040> minor<00:05:42.220> chords

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
all your majors and your minor chords

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.160 
all your majors and your minor chords
and<00:05:42.700> you've<00:05:43.090> also<00:05:43.240> learned<00:05:43.540> some<00:05:43.840> slightly

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
and you've also learned some slightly

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.410 
and you've also learned some slightly
cooler<00:05:44.320> ways<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.980> playing<00:05:45.250> your<00:05:45.670> A's<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:46.090> your

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
cooler ways of playing your A's and your

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.760 
cooler ways of playing your A's and your
f<00:05:46.510> sharp<00:05:46.540> minor<00:05:46.840> because<00:05:47.080> for<00:05:47.350> example<00:05:47.650> F

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
f sharp minor because for example F

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.910 
f sharp minor because for example F
sharp<00:05:47.980> minor<00:05:48.130> when<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.490> play<00:05:48.840> this<00:05:49.840> over<00:05:50.830> an

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
sharp minor when you play this over an

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.740 
sharp minor when you play this over an
f-sharp<00:05:51.070> that's<00:05:51.970> a<00:05:52.060> pretty<00:05:52.210> cool<00:05:52.420> chord<00:05:52.630> I

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
f-sharp that's a pretty cool chord I

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.660 
f-sharp that's a pretty cool chord I
mean<00:05:52.870> F<00:05:53.020> sharp<00:05:53.260> minor<00:05:53.410> is<00:05:53.650> really<00:05:53.980> just<00:05:54.190> that

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
mean F sharp minor is really just that

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.140 
mean F sharp minor is really just that
that<00:05:55.710> but<00:05:56.710> but<00:05:57.040> now<00:05:57.130> we<00:05:57.190> put<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.460> B<00:05:57.730> in<00:05:57.910> it<00:05:58.030> we've

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
that but but now we put a B in it we've

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.240 
that but but now we put a B in it we've
got<00:05:58.300> an<00:05:58.390> e<00:05:58.600> in<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.840> so<00:05:59.260> that's<00:05:59.440> really<00:05:59.620> F<00:05:59.950> sharp

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
got an e in it so that's really F sharp

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.990 
got an e in it so that's really F sharp
minor<00:06:00.490> 7<00:06:01.500> with<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.530> B<00:06:02.830> in<00:06:02.890> it<00:06:03.070> now<00:06:03.580> that's<00:06:03.790> really

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
minor 7 with a B in it now that's really

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.120 
minor 7 with a B in it now that's really
F<00:06:04.210> sharp<00:06:04.450> minor<00:06:04.570> 11<00:06:05.230> so<00:06:05.470> you<00:06:05.830> know<00:06:05.890> it's<00:06:06.070> a

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
F sharp minor 11 so you know it's a

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.790 
F sharp minor 11 so you know it's a
pretty<00:06:06.460> fancy<00:06:06.700> chord<00:06:07.210> F<00:06:07.390> sharp<00:06:07.690> minor<00:06:07.900> 11<00:06:08.380> but

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
pretty fancy chord F sharp minor 11 but

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.840 
pretty fancy chord F sharp minor 11 but
we<00:06:08.890> don't<00:06:09.070> just<00:06:09.130> think<00:06:09.400> about<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.730> you<00:06:09.820> just

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
we don't just think about that you just

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:21.000 
we don't just think about that you just
think<00:06:10.060> about<00:06:10.300> it<00:06:10.420> as<00:06:10.540> a<00:06:10.690> two<00:06:10.840> over<00:06:11.830> F<00:06:11.950> so

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.560 

just<00:06:22.010> do<00:06:22.130> this<00:06:22.250> progression<00:06:22.730> over<00:06:22.790> and<00:06:23.240> over

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
just do this progression over and over

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.200 
just do this progression over and over
until<00:06:24.140> you<00:06:24.440> get<00:06:24.590> really<00:06:24.920> familiar<00:06:25.160> with<00:06:25.580> all

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
until you get really familiar with all

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.750 
until you get really familiar with all
different<00:06:26.810> ways<00:06:26.960> of<00:06:27.200> playing<00:06:27.380> a<00:06:27.710> and<00:06:28.100> a<00:06:28.190> 2's<00:06:28.550> in

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
different ways of playing a and a 2's in

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.330 
different ways of playing a and a 2's in
the<00:06:28.850> right<00:06:29.030> hand
