00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to rinse my nettles off a lot and then I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.870

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
you strain off the plant material after

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.870 
you strain off the plant material after
you've<00:03:03.650> simmered<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.190> good<00:03:05.610> amount<00:03:05.790> of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
you've simmered it for a good amount of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.210 
you've simmered it for a good amount of
time<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.230> extract<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.380> lot<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.890> plant

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
time to extract a lot of that plant

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.460 
time to extract a lot of that plant
flavor<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.450> boil<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.780> down<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.110> half

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
flavor and then you boil it down to half

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.610 
flavor and then you boil it down to half
you<00:03:11.360> evaporate<00:03:12.360> off<00:03:12.540> at<00:03:12.780> least<00:03:12.930> half<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you evaporate off at least half of it so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.730 
you evaporate off at least half of it so
like<00:03:13.890> say<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.160> got<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> cup<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.780> broth<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
like say you got a cup of a broth you

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.979 
like say you got a cup of a broth you
evaporate<00:03:17.010> down<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> half<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.090> cup<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.900> you

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
evaporate down to a half a cup so you

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.170 
evaporate down to a half a cup so you
make<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.290> nice<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.500> strong<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.610> again<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
make it nice and strong and again just a
