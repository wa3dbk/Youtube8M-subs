okay<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.270> here<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.290> earth<00:00:07.350> again<00:00:13.459> North

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
okay so here is the earth again North

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.700 
okay so here is the earth again North
Pole<00:00:15.770> South<00:00:16.770> Pole

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.429 
Pole South Pole
equator<00:00:20.019> and<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:22.490> observer<00:00:22.910> is<00:00:23.300> now<00:00:23.630> sitting

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
equator and the observer is now sitting

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.839 
equator and the observer is now sitting
on<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:25.250> equator<00:00:25.519> right<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:31.489> earth<00:00:31.579> is

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
on the equator right the earth is

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.450 
on the equator right the earth is
spinning<00:00:32.710> from<00:00:33.710> west<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.219> east<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:36.949> as<00:00:37.400> a

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
spinning from west to east and as a

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.119 
spinning from west to east and as a
result<00:00:38.199> it<00:00:39.199> appears<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:39.860> all<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.699> stars<00:00:41.059> are

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
result it appears that all the stars are

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.710 
result it appears that all the stars are
revolving<00:00:43.129> from<00:00:44.050> east<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.229> west<00:00:46.269> along<00:00:47.269> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
revolving from east to west along the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.729 
revolving from east to west along the
paths<00:00:48.790> there<00:00:49.790> are<00:00:49.940> pal<00:00:50.269> always<00:00:51.260> parallel<00:00:51.649> to

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
paths there are pal always parallel to

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:03.870 
paths there are pal always parallel to
celestial<00:00:52.429> equator<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:54.019> a<00:00:54.289> star<00:00:54.679> here

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.570 

would<00:01:04.449> be<00:01:04.629> moving<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.199> so<00:01:05.580> right

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:25.580 

or<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.420> one<00:01:14.070> say<00:01:15.070> located<00:01:15.670> here

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.780 

would<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.310> moving<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:29.630> agree

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.110 

well<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.930> horizon<00:01:38.260> of<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.490> observer

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
well this is the horizon of the observer

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:50.940 
well this is the horizon of the observer
sitting<00:01:40.510> on<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.960> equator

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.609 

every<00:01:51.729> single<00:01:52.180> star<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.900> this<00:01:53.110> observer

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
every single star that this observer

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.590 
every single star that this observer
sees<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:56.020> rises<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.380> sets

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.420 

when<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.650> talk<00:02:03.890> about

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
when you talk about

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.889 
when you talk about
emotion<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:05.150> anything<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:07.340> always<00:02:07.550> have<00:02:08.539> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
emotion of anything you always have to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.580 
emotion of anything you always have to
or<00:02:09.429> location<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.550> anything<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.810> always<00:02:12.080> have

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
or location of anything you always have

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.200 
or location of anything you always have
to<00:02:12.890> specify<00:02:14.170> relative<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.380> what<00:02:15.880> what<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
to specify relative to what what is the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.350 
to specify relative to what what is the
reference<00:02:17.600> point<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.310> are<00:02:19.490> talking<00:02:19.790> now

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
reference point so we are talking now

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.680 
reference point so we are talking now
about<00:02:21.160> what<00:02:22.160> different<00:02:22.730> observers<00:02:23.240> when<00:02:23.600> I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
about what different observers when I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.830 
about what different observers when I
say<00:02:23.930> different<00:02:24.790> located<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:25.940> different<00:02:26.150> spots

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
say different located at different spots

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.120 
say different located at different spots
on<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.260> earth<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.180> looked<00:02:29.420> first<00:02:29.780> at

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
on the earth see so we looked first at

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.850 
on the earth see so we looked first at
the<00:02:31.130> observer<00:02:31.520> sitting<00:02:31.940> at<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.480> North<00:02:32.720> Pole

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
the observer sitting at the North Pole

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.500 
the observer sitting at the North Pole
now<00:02:33.860> we<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.340> looking<00:02:34.520> at<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.090> observer

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
now we are looking at the observer

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:46.380 
now we are looking at the observer
sitting<00:02:35.959> on<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.440> equator

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.260 

okay<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:49.270> observer<00:02:49.810> will<00:02:50.970> actually<00:02:51.970> see

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
okay so this observer will actually see

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.030 
okay so this observer will actually see
the<00:02:52.660> two<00:02:54.000> celestial<00:02:55.000> poles<00:02:55.360> would<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.710> his

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
the two celestial poles would be on his

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:07.330 
the two celestial poles would be on his
horizon

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.140 

and<00:03:07.459> as<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> result<00:03:08.470> every<00:03:09.489> single<00:03:10.489> star<00:03:10.849> that

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
and as a result every single star that

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.190 
and as a result every single star that
he<00:03:11.420> observes<00:03:12.170> will<00:03:13.099> be<00:03:13.310> rising<00:03:14.140> above<00:03:15.140> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
he observes will be rising above the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.570 
he observes will be rising above the
horizon<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.090> setting<00:03:17.090> below<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.170> horizon

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
horizon and setting below the horizon

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.540 
horizon and setting below the horizon
namely<00:03:19.630> no<00:03:20.630> star<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.260> he<00:03:21.410> can<00:03:21.620> observe<00:03:22.010> is

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
namely no star that he can observe is

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.100 
namely no star that he can observe is
always<00:03:23.090> visible<00:03:23.330> they<00:03:24.140> all<00:03:24.380> rise<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.130> set<00:03:26.110> and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
always visible they all rise and set and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
always visible they all rise and set and
no<00:03:27.950> starry<00:03:28.370> circumpolar<00:03:28.970> stars
