00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Greetings from the boys welcome back to them 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.930
 we use with a device in quotes 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 new because you see we have a lg g2 here 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 I'm going to talk about g2 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 answered an application that exploits 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.420
 a framework that should be installed as if 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.760
 were simple apk directly on the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.830
 device that just goes to change 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.880
 allows us to modify aesthetically 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.800
 our g2 without having to resort to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.630
 packages then flash via recovery 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.340
 etc. etc. is an application that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 we download directly into the play store 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 free 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 therefore also exists for the g3 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 an application is not universal they are 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.350
 different versions however is a package that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 also exists for the g3 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 only note that you need to have root 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 so you must have already run the root 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 because it will ask us to install 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.210
 exposed framework directly 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 from the application itself makes it to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.289
 download and install we restart the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.970
 everything and we are going to personalize the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:05.569
 our lgg 2 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.569
 [Music] 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.520
 here we are with our updated g2 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.020
 precisely to android kitkat 4.4.2 vi 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.549
 I just wanted to show the two exposed 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 I state that I have not installed any 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.930
 alternative rom on the smartphone at 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 stock firmware the last arrived note 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
 kit kat 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.539
 or simply run the root I have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 installed the modified recovery because 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.610
 I need it to perform some 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 operations to optimize 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 consumption that if not I do not say are exorbitant 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 however certain things in my opinion consume 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.060
 too much battery certain applications 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.100
 what is this application is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.890
 an application with a kind of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.170
 mega package package that allows us 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.659
 to change you see a whole series of 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.220
 settings of our g2 or for example 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.530
 also the g3 because it also came out 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.259
 precisely for the genre from the same 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.149
 generic clicks developer 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.369
 we have the possibility to insert 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.150
 then recent police screens 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.670
 remove the task manager and go to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.190
 close everything in the task 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.709
 manager for example to disable le 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.690
 animations at the insertion of the usb o 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.290
 of couples for example to those who cannot 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.989
 pleasure 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.549
 then we have in the experimental level 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.840
 add the menu button to 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.150
 settings what I found 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 interesting see below I have that 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.350
 multitasking button why 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.650
 however I find it much more comfortable for 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.870
 example of the menu button I find 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.730
 absolutely useless except for example 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.450
 see here appears already in the application 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 ok 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.170
 what i did then i played in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.850
 navigation bar see key position 1 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.859
 rate two trusts or three we can get 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.859
 up to five keys I don't like it 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:02.280
 I prefer to have only three back button 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.019
 button 1 button 2 we have a button 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 but his multitasking spells, however, we can 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.359
 do choose prolonged pressure you see 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.359
 we have the menu button you see here 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.010
 we can set a second function 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.080
 that activates what happens to me for 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.520
 example I do once activates me in 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.890
 multitasking comes back 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.340
 keep it pressed in this case okay not 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.290
 does not open anything we go to not open 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.260
 so an application has for example already 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.380
 new hold down see or open the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.810
 tab of the settings memo 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.730
 very very comfortable thing that I have 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.270
 found not to have when precisely 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.670
 inserted the multitasking button 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.290
 this in my opinion is the function for 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.240
 what concerns me more interesting than 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.670
 this package then of course we can 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.440
 go to change themes and colors go 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.570
 activated we can change the color 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.680
 status bar and navigation bar 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.900
 and going to customize it to the bottom 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 style bar icons in style 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.700
 kitkat then these are replaced 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.180
 things this up with those of kits 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.790
 kat 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.430
 a whole series of applications that 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.040
 we can just go to ad 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.990
 implement on our g2 without having to 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.880
 do absolutely nothing because it is 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.799
 an application that installs from the play 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.810
 there is the store unload on the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.760
 smartphone and we only need to 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.879
 having the root root is also exposed 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:34.490
 I don't remember exposed 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:37.220
 let's see where it is as far as the g2x oreal 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.710
 pose of the talks you see we have to 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.539
 install the framework I'll marry you 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.759
 installer here it is I didn't remember the 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.620
 full name anyway through the 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.830
 tutorial you see we can download it 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.479
 directly us on our lgg two in 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.430
 this case then we download it yes 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.199
 installs as an application it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.289
 we update because of the default not 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.879
 is not even activated we restart the 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.240
 our device will therefore come 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.650
 also our ours reported 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.900
 application within this 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.310
 framework then restart the terminal 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.620
 skip the tutorial because I already have it 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.720
 fact and we can already access precisely 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.900
 all these options 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.120
 we then have clock to hide or 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.969
 center it etc. etc. all one 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.949
 set of functions very very much 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.789
 interesting that allow us precisely 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.819
 to go and change ours the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.800
 ours of two for example I see here 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:33.229
 in the notification bar I no longer have 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.030
 volume control but 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.770
 I just removed it 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900
 so I had the slider removed 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.639
 opus volume or I can safely 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.380
 remove all that is tender 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.219
 only toggle for connections 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.020
 then really rapids something from 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.270
 have if you are a freak 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.340
 on your g2 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.199
 I repeat a very fast application 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.659
 very easy to download 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.039
 you need to have root not 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.919
 necessarily a modified recovery 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.330
 so low only the root but already 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.630
 which made the root in my opinion agrees 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.949
 also put a recovery, and then 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.810
 nothing we install a lot 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.630
 simply from the play store and on 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.219
 very convenient for those who may know how to do it 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.610
 a little more with the smartphone 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:19.819
 tweaking a jailer more and 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.250
 I think it must be installed 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.930
 on tg2 for the moment really all one 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.930
 I greet everyone from claudio ciao Guido
