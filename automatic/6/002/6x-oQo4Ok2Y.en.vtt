00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.650

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:33.829
 assistance do naturally 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.489

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 programs to you what and so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.789
 and you find that you have previously 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.850
 bet prompting certain done for in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 but it is not in a number 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.949
 to lose 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.949
 I just don't change 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 money sends 11 no no because then I go 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.610
 actually prefer to be concerned with themselves 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 clay and lime built that a valid 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.940
 COL or what happens to it when 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.540

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.220
 those people no idea where but stays 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.260
 if you like something you do what you do 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.260

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:50.870

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.360

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 very nice only you have to do it that way 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760
 see 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.220
 all charities are own and all 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.190
 trees and I see the bottom our lake and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.470
 ill get samira and how long it lasts 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.470
 do up then i think personally 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 TV show that really likes film 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.550
 and then I have a swimmer goal here 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.290
 done 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.390
 content flow from my cottage where they 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.790
 don't really swim in doing that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.560
 he is a fan of intrusive 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.300
 and then when I come back from going out and me 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.270
 see him rather understood him a tenner 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.280
 Guardian values he goes along must 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.800
 he know 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.620
 ampere he know but just too much anyway 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.780
 well so still what give up and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.320
 he says it's about surfing but like you 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 For example itself by another city 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.790
 he walks example and sees poor here 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.150
 then I don't go all those people either 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 of it goes there also says that i am not like that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.120
 often go about ainsi but when i get there 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 , and you can make people happy more 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.730
 mine got five because you can now 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.010
 one not very long you provided 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.950
 of money and what do you say adriene whole 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.739
 well thought this was such an event where it 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.599
 for young is also nice because 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.849
 and where so much more is a must 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:28.680
 just stands for you if you clean yourself 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:46.230
 white gogo dress 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 even if your person sees no success 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.310
 there is a heart but if you really like it 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.549
 supporting charity was really convinced 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:04.260
 became as if there were good for vagrants 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:07.229
 in itself just no man I explain 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 I think I say a lot of profit here 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:16.400
 to be 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.400
