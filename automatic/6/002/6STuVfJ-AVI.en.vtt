the<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:12.269> match<00:00:12.889> Bray<00:00:13.889> Wyatt<00:00:14.400> versus<00:00:15.059> Kane

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the first match Bray Wyatt versus Kane

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.769 
the first match Bray Wyatt versus Kane
and<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.870> ring<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.230> fire<00:00:16.260> match<00:00:17.630> naturally<00:00:18.630> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and a ring of fire match naturally you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.269 
and a ring of fire match naturally you
would<00:00:18.930> think<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.350> love<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.859> match<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
would think that I love that match but I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.269 
would think that I love that match but I
did<00:00:20.550> not<00:00:20.699> love<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.060> match<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.859> actually

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
did not love that match it was actually

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
did not love that match it was actually
pretty<00:00:23.460> fucking<00:00:23.939> bad<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.600> did<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
pretty fucking bad I did not like to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
pretty fucking bad I did not like to
Bray<00:00:25.800> Wyatt<00:00:26.099> match<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.930> blame

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
Bray Wyatt match but now I don't blame

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.529 
Bray Wyatt match but now I don't blame
this<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.619> Bray<00:00:28.830> Wyatt<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.580> blame<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
this on Bray Wyatt I blame this on the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.520 
this on Bray Wyatt I blame this on the
WWE<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.619> making<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.250> absurd<00:00:33.079> match<00:00:34.079> type

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
WWE for making some absurd match type

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.310 
WWE for making some absurd match type
like<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> Inferno<00:00:35.640> match<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:37.079> stopped

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like the Inferno match that they stopped

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.430 
like the Inferno match that they stopped
using<00:00:37.590> years<00:00:38.070> ago<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.000> stupid

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
using years ago because it was so stupid

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
using years ago because it was so stupid
so<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.829> didn't<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> Bray<00:00:42.210> Wyatt<00:00:42.239> match<00:00:42.719> but

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
so I didn't like to Bray Wyatt match but

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
so I didn't like to Bray Wyatt match but
I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.230> it'll<00:00:43.350> been<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:43.829> better<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.730> they

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I think it'll been much better had they

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.779 
I think it'll been much better had they
just<00:00:44.910> had<00:00:45.270> Bray<00:00:45.539> Wyatt<00:00:45.899> versus<00:00:46.230> Kane<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.920> say

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
just had Bray Wyatt versus Kane and say

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.450 
just had Bray Wyatt versus Kane and say
a<00:00:48.030> hardcore<00:00:48.539> match<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.110> something<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.770> that's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a hardcore match or something so that's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.130 
a hardcore match or something so that's
what<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.090> should<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.360> done<00:00:51.390> maybe

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
what I think they should have done maybe

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
what I think they should have done maybe
it<00:00:52.289> buried<00:00:52.559> alive<00:00:52.829> match<00:00:53.100> something<00:00:53.640> other

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it buried alive match something other

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
it buried alive match something other
than<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.719> did<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:55.920> could<00:00:56.129> have

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
than what they did when we could have

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.090 
than what they did when we could have
actually<00:00:56.399> obscene<00:00:57.000> Bray<00:00:57.719> Wyatt<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.920> ring

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
actually obscene Bray Wyatt in the ring

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.220 
actually obscene Bray Wyatt in the ring
because<00:00:59.430> he's<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.000> damn<00:01:00.329> good<00:01:00.359> wrestler

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
because he's a really damn good wrestler

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.700 
because he's a really damn good wrestler
so<00:01:01.699> didn't<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.180> match<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:04.559> we

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so didn't really like that match then we

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
so didn't really like that match then we
got<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> Cody<00:01:05.339> Rhodes<00:01:05.670> versus<00:01:06.270> damien<00:01:06.780> sandow

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
got the Cody Rhodes versus damien sandow

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
got the Cody Rhodes versus damien sandow

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
Bray Wyatt now at the time Damien is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
Bray Wyatt now at the time Damien is
saying<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.189> Artie<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> show<00:01:24.570> but

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
saying that was on Artie on the show but

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.840 
saying that was on Artie on the show but
I<00:01:24.840> said<00:01:25.110> within<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> year<00:01:25.770> Bray<00:01:26.100> Wyatt<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.670> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I said within a year Bray Wyatt would be

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.530 
I said within a year Bray Wyatt would be
on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.570> show<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:28.020> he<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.140> gonna<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.530> big<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
he won the bet because Bray Wyatt

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
he won the bet because Bray Wyatt
injured<00:01:33.990> himself<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> went

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
injured himself and so much time it went

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929

by<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.590> wasn't<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.979> fan<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> Damien

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

Sandow I haven't been a fan of Damien
Sandow<00:01:41.369> until<00:01:41.939> recently<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.810> did<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.590> like

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
Sandow until recently I did not like

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190

Damien<00:01:44.369> Sandow<00:01:44.579> versus<00:01:45.180> Cody<00:01:45.450> Rhodes<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Damien Sandow versus Cody Rhodes I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
Damien Sandow versus Cody Rhodes I
thought<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.250> another<00:01:47.490> boring<00:01:47.820> match<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
thought it was another boring match it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.940 
thought it was another boring match it
was<00:01:48.750> two<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> row<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> thought

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
was two in a row that I thought

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.039 
was two in a row that I thought
SummerSlam<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.729> starting<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> fall<00:01:51.570> apart<00:01:51.600> on

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
SummerSlam was starting to fall apart on

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.460 
SummerSlam was starting to fall apart on
