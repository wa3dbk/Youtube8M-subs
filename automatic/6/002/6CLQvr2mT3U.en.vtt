00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
about two days but then I decided that I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
about two days but then I decided that I
really<00:00:25.769> wanted<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.779> have<00:00:27.779> leave<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.439> my

really wanted to have leave out in my

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
really wanted to have leave out in my
usual<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:29.250> part<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> will<00:00:30.359> insert<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
usual side part so I will insert a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
usual side part so I will insert a
picture<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> looked<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.309> when<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
picture of what it looked like when I

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
picture of what it looked like when I
had<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> closure<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.780> really

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
had the closure in which is really

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
had the closure in which is really
awesome<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> closure<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.130> great

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
awesome like the closure was great

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.810 
awesome like the closure was great
it<00:00:35.880> laid<00:00:36.329> perfectly<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.399> liked<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it laid perfectly and I really liked it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.360 
it laid perfectly and I really liked it
but<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.649> really<00:00:40.649> wanted<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> leave<00:00:41.129> out

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but I just really wanted to leave out

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
but I just really wanted to leave out
for<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.780> look<00:00:42.899> really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
for this so that it could look really

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
for this so that it could look really
really<00:00:43.410> natural<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.280> could<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.610> other

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
really natural and I could do other

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.260 
really natural and I could do other
styles<00:00:45.480> besides<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.270> middle

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
styles besides just you know a middle
part<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> look

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
part which I really don't think I look

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
part which I really don't think I look
good<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> middle<00:00:50.640> part<00:00:50.820> anyway<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> don't

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.240 
that's really it way I sleep is I just
put<00:03:32.210> this<00:03:32.300> hair<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.630> ponytail<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.470> then<00:03:33.890> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
put this hair in a ponytail and then I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.100 
put this hair in a ponytail and then I
just<00:03:34.490> wrap<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.940> scarf<00:03:35.210> around<00:03:35.390> my<00:03:35.630> edges<00:03:36.080> and

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
just wrap a scarf around my edges and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.270 
just wrap a scarf around my edges and
that's<00:03:36.410> how<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> sleep

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
that's how I sleep

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.390 
that's how I sleep
and<00:03:37.430> when<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.760> wake<00:03:38.060> up<00:03:38.090> it's<00:03:38.540> really<00:03:38.900> like

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and when I wake up it's really like

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.650 
and when I wake up it's really like
really<00:03:40.400> really<00:03:40.580> really<00:03:40.670> low<00:03:41.030> maintenance<00:03:41.300> but

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
really really really low maintenance but

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.300 
really really really low maintenance but
it'll<00:03:41.900> be<00:03:41.990> like<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:42.410> dip<00:03:42.770> from<00:03:43.130> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
it'll be like a little dip from the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.130 
it'll be like a little dip from the
ponytail<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:43.970> just<00:03:44.270> bump<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.660> out<00:03:44.870> and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
ponytail so I just bump that out and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.350 
ponytail so I just bump that out and
I'll<00:03:45.350> be<00:03:45.470> ready<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.770> go<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.910> do<00:03:47.060> my

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
I'll be ready to go like when I do my

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.360 
I'll be ready to go like when I do my
hair<00:03:47.660> it'll<00:03:47.990> literally<00:03:48.350> take<00:03:48.650> me<00:03:48.860> about<00:03:49.070> five

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
hair it'll literally take me about five

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.100 
hair it'll literally take me about five
minutes<00:03:49.910> because<00:03:50.060> his<00:03:50.360> hair<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:50.900> low

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
minutes because his hair is so low

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.600 
minutes because his hair is so low
maintenance<00:03:51.350> since<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.980> straight<00:03:52.340> hair

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
maintenance since it is straight hair

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.180 
maintenance since it is straight hair
and<00:03:52.850> then<00:03:53.030> it's<00:03:53.180> no<00:03:53.330> tangles<00:03:53.960> so<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> don't<00:03:54.980> put

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190
