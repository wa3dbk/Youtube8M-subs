00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.699 

here<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.090> different<00:00:09.299> different<00:00:10.170> levels

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:10.709 
here we have different different levels

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.740 
here we have different different levels
that<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.219> gates<00:00:11.430> are<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.540> higher

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that the gates are at some are higher

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.660 
that the gates are at some are higher
and<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.469> lower<00:00:13.650> than<00:00:13.889> each<00:00:14.070> other<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
and some are lower than each other and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.550 
and some are lower than each other and
so<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> adds<00:00:15.119> an<00:00:15.330> extra<00:00:15.539> dimension<00:00:15.930> for<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
so it adds an extra dimension for the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
so it adds an extra dimension for the
pilots<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.130> fly<00:00:17.400> three<00:00:17.789> dimensionally

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
pilots to fly three dimensionally

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:30.770 
pilots to fly three dimensionally
through<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> track

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.290 

we<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.230> three<00:00:31.500> exits<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.130> airplane<00:00:32.400> first

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
we have three exits in an airplane first

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
we have three exits in an airplane first
of<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> vertical<00:00:34.290> axis<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of all it's a vertical axis what you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.510 
of all it's a vertical axis what you
steer<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.940> rudder<00:00:36.950> with<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.100> feet<00:00:38.310> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
steer with the rudder with your feet you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.600 
steer with the rudder with your feet you
select<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:40.200> second<00:00:40.559> axis<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.280> lateral

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
select the second axis is the lateral

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.210 
select the second axis is the lateral
axis<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:42.989> steered<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
axis what your steered with your

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.549 
axis what your steered with your
elevator<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.150> up<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
elevator is going up and down and the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
elevator is going up and down and the
reference<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.100> always<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.850> nose<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
reference is always the nose because the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.210 
reference is always the nose because the
only<00:00:48.900> thing<00:00:49.170> you'll<00:00:49.290> see<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> airplane<00:00:49.949> is

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
only thing you'll see on the airplane is

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.840 
only thing you'll see on the airplane is
up<00:00:50.370> front<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> nose

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.350 

and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> longitudinal<00:00:58.410> axis

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
and then we have the longitudinal axis

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.420 
and then we have the longitudinal axis
which<00:01:00.360> is<00:01:00.390> stared<00:01:00.810> with<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.320> Iran<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.829> roll

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
which is stared with in Iran you roll

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.380 
which is stared with in Iran you roll
the<00:01:02.670> airplane

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.090 

the<00:01:08.390> most<00:01:08.600> important<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:09.380> it's<00:01:09.620> common

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the most important is that it's common

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.830 
the most important is that it's common
iced<00:01:10.400> when<00:01:10.880> we<00:01:11.000> deflect<00:01:11.390> these<00:01:11.510> flight

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
iced when we deflect these flight

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.410 
iced when we deflect these flight
controls<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.830> causes<00:01:13.400> some<00:01:13.550> adverse<00:01:14.000> yaw<00:01:14.270> on

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
controls it causes some adverse yaw on

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420 
controls it causes some adverse yaw on
the<00:01:14.510> plane<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:14.900> can<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> nose<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.860> plane

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the plane it can get the nose the plane

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.370 
the plane it can get the nose the plane
to<00:01:16.610> move<00:01:16.760> side<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.060> side<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:17.870> is<00:01:17.930> something

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
to move side to side this is something

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.990 
to move side to side this is something
we<00:01:18.470> don't<00:01:18.590> want<00:01:18.740> we<00:01:19.100> want<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.400> plane<00:01:19.610> staying

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
we don't want we want the plane staying

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.910 
we don't want we want the plane staying
pointed<00:01:20.450> directly<00:01:20.570> into<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.290> airflow<00:01:21.650> you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
pointed directly into the airflow you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.340 
pointed directly into the airflow you
can<00:01:22.100> see<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.030> smoke<00:01:23.300> train<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.930> some<00:01:24.230> of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
can see in the smoke train have some of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.830 
can see in the smoke train have some of
the<00:01:24.470> guys<00:01:24.640> sometimes<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.760> -<00:01:26.150> whether<00:01:26.390> that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the guys sometimes a - whether that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.020 
the guys sometimes a - whether that
between<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.800> going<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.790> smoke

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
between is going like this at the smoke

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.700 
between is going like this at the smoke
is<00:01:29.150> going<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.630> different<00:01:29.870> direction<00:01:30.110> that

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
is going a different direction that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.770 
is going a different direction that
means<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.520> airplane<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.030> steered<00:01:32.570> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
means the airplane is not steered and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.930 
means the airplane is not steered and
controlled<00:01:33.170> correctly<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.520> lose<00:01:34.670> time

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
controlled correctly and you lose time

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.780 
controlled correctly and you lose time
with<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.330> because<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:35.810> drag

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.090 

in<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.300> area<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.780> exactly<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.560> than

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in the area it's exactly the same than

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
in the area it's exactly the same than
on<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.760> normal<00:01:44.970> airplane<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:46.140> big<00:01:46.320> difference

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
on a normal airplane the big difference

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
on a normal airplane the big difference
is<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.430> much<00:01:47.640> quicker<00:01:47.910> if<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.750> much

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
is going much quicker if we have much

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.770 
is going much quicker if we have much
less<00:01:49.530> room<00:01:49.800> forever<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.510> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
less room forever because it's just a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
less room forever because it's just a
blink<00:01:52.230> of<00:01:52.380> an<00:01:52.500> eye<00:01:52.650> or<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.400> decision<00:01:53.730> what<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.120> do

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
blink of an eye or a decision what we do

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
blink of an eye or a decision what we do
here<00:01:54.480> this<00:01:54.810> aircraft<00:01:55.260> will<00:01:55.410> roll<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.710> 400

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here this aircraft will roll over 400

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
here this aircraft will roll over 400
degrees<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.210> seconds<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:58.050> would<00:01:58.410> be<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
degrees in seconds so that would be a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.550 
degrees in seconds so that would be a
full<00:01:58.860> roll<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.460> less<00:01:59.910> than<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.390> second<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:01.440> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
full roll in less than one second so to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.420 
full roll in less than one second so to
stop<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
stop it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.180 
stop it

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
need for a sharp turn in the track like

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.170 
need for a sharp turn in the track like
this<00:02:06.990> chicane<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.680> example<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.520> even<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.940> come

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
level immediately at the gate it's all

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
level immediately at the gate it's all
just<00:02:12.360> lots<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.690> practice<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.260> internal

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just lots of practice and internal

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
just lots of practice and internal
timing<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:15.360> spent<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.690> lot<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> time

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
timing so we spent a lot of time

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.590 
timing so we spent a lot of time
training<00:02:16.440> reaction<00:02:17.160> speed<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:18.330> getting

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
training reaction speed and just getting

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.210 
training reaction speed and just getting
really<00:02:18.870> used<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> sensitivity<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
really used to the sensitivity of the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.570 
really used to the sensitivity of the
control<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:22.470> me<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.590> get<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.130> airplane

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
control for me I get in this airplane

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.490 
control for me I get in this airplane
and<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.880> strap<00:02:24.240> into<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.020> almost<00:02:25.200> like

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and I strap into it but it's almost like

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.710 
and I strap into it but it's almost like
an<00:02:25.620> extension<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.430> body<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.970> don't<00:02:27.090> feel<00:02:27.510> as

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
an extension of my body I don't feel as

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050 
an extension of my body I don't feel as
if<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:28.050> making<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.590> control<00:02:29.460> input<00:02:29.670> that's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
if I'm making a control input that's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.840 
if I'm making a control input that's
moving<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.080> big<00:02:31.260> machine<00:02:31.680> around<00:02:32.070> me<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.550> just

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
moving a big machine around me I just

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.370 
moving a big machine around me I just
think<00:02:33.060> okay<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.330> need<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> move<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.140> this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
think okay I need to move like this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.990 
think okay I need to move like this
through<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.709> course<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.310> normal<00:02:35.730> airplane

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
through the course a normal airplane

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.270 
through the course a normal airplane
generally<00:02:36.840> pilots<00:02:37.410> don't<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.740> any<00:02:37.890> setup

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
generally pilots don't do any setup

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.340 
generally pilots don't do any setup
that's<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.760> how<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.910> airplane<00:02:39.150> flies<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:40.230> do

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that's just how the airplane flies we do

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.440 
that's just how the airplane flies we do
a<00:02:40.380> lot<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.770> setup<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.580> fly<00:02:41.820> how<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
a lot of setup to get it to fly how the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.620 
a lot of setup to get it to fly how the
pilot<00:02:42.780> wants<00:02:43.080> what<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.880> adjust<00:02:45.240> every

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
pilot wants what you can adjust every

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.120 
pilot wants what you can adjust every
app<00:02:45.780> name<00:02:46.020> everyone<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> different

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
app name everyone has a different

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430 
app name everyone has a different
or<00:02:48.430> wish<00:02:48.700> how<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.300> set<00:02:49.570> up<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.810> airplane<00:02:50.170> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
or wish how to set up this airplane and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.620 
or wish how to set up this airplane and
that's<00:02:50.980> why<00:02:51.250> every<00:02:51.700> airplane<00:02:51.940> flies<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> little

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that's why every airplane flies a little

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's why every airplane flies a little
bit<00:02:52.720> differently<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.620> mine<00:02:53.860> set<00:02:53.890> up<00:02:54.250> just

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
bit differently I have mine set up just

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.350 
bit differently I have mine set up just
how<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:55.000> it

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
how I like it

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.080 
how I like it
but<00:02:55.720> if<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.050> were<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.680> Machias<00:02:57.580> azure

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
but if I were to get in Machias azure

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150 
but if I were to get in Machias azure
Honus<00:02:58.420> YZ<00:02:58.570> plane<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.320> would<00:02:59.470> probably<00:02:59.710> feel

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
Honus YZ plane it would probably feel

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.410 
Honus YZ plane it would probably feel
different<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.700> don't<00:03:00.760> know<00:03:00.910> they<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.150> let<00:03:01.360> me

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
different I don't know they don't let me

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.140 
different I don't know they don't let me
fly<00:03:01.720> their<00:03:01.900> plane
