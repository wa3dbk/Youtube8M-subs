00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
show you what you could do with the

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.880 
show you what you could do with the
xposed<00:00:03.000> framework<00:00:03.149> module<00:00:04.020> gravity<00:00:04.410> box<00:00:04.620> now

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
xposed framework module gravity box now

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.050 
xposed framework module gravity box now
if<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.160> don't<00:00:05.250> know<00:00:05.370> what<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> xposed

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
if you don't know what the xposed

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.210 
if you don't know what the xposed
framework<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.870> I'll<00:00:07.200> put<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.560> link<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.069> the

description to my other video I made
which<00:00:09.990> explains<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.250> how<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.370> get

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
which explains what it is and how to get

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.280 
which explains what it is and how to get
it<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.630> video<00:00:12.900> we're<00:00:13.080> gonna<00:00:13.139> be

so<00:00:15.719> once<00:00:15.870> you've<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.230> module<00:00:16.560> installed

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
so once you've got the module installed

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.140 
so once you've got the module installed
and<00:00:17.130> activated<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.090> gonna

the first one we've got is lockscreen
tweaks<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.390> tap<00:00:45.600> into<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.989> we've<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
tweaks if we tap into this we've got the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
tweaks if we tap into this we've got the
unlock<00:00:46.950> ring<00:00:47.190> settings<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.969> allows<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
unlock ring settings and this allows you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
unlock ring settings and this allows you
to<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> unlock<00:00:49.320> ring<00:00:49.620> targets<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to have the unlock ring targets if you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
to have the unlock ring targets if you
don't<00:00:50.430> know<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:51.030> show<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.420> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Android Central that'll do for now and

Android Central that'll do for now and
then<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> lock<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> device<00:01:02.539> go<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> unlock

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
then if we lock the device go to unlock

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
then if we lock the device go to unlock
it<00:01:04.260> you'll<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.519> more

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
change that back to three and this is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.040 
change that back to three and this is
quite<00:02:26.790> an<00:02:26.910> interesting<00:02:27.000> option<00:02:27.420> override
