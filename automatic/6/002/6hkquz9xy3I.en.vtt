00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
Batman from Arkham Asylum or really

Batman from Arkham Asylum or really
Arkham<00:02:20.970> City<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.450> matter<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> really

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
Arkham City for that matter but I really

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.350 
Arkham City for that matter but I really
liked<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.920> DC<00:02:23.250> collectibles<00:02:23.730> version<00:02:24.269> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
liked the DC collectibles version the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.970 
liked the DC collectibles version the
six-inch<00:02:24.810> version<00:02:25.140> they've<00:02:25.500> already<00:02:25.709> had<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
six-inch version they've already had a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.340 
six-inch version they've already had a
look<00:02:26.220> at<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:27.030> particular<00:02:27.329> Batman<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.079> has

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
look at this particular Batman just has

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.020 
look at this particular Batman just has
elements<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.370> didn't<00:02:29.640> really<00:02:29.820> like

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
elements to it that I didn't really like

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.660 
elements to it that I didn't really like
about<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.390> original<00:02:30.920> Mattel<00:02:31.920> figures<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
about the original Mattel figures the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.530 
about the original Mattel figures the
Mattel<00:02:33.540> line<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.079> Arkham<00:02:34.410> City<00:02:34.890> Arkham<00:02:35.220> Asylum

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
Mattel line of Arkham City Arkham Asylum

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.059 
Mattel line of Arkham City Arkham Asylum
figures<00:02:36.540> they've<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.349> taken

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
figures they've just taken

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.910 
figures they've just taken
and<00:02:38.159> just<00:02:38.610> made<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> smaller<00:02:39.569> version<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.469> him

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and just made a smaller version of him

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.789 
and just made a smaller version of him
and<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.879> still<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.659> just<00:02:42.870> doesn't<00:02:43.290> work<00:02:43.469> I

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
and I still think it just doesn't work I

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.250 
and I still think it just doesn't work I
think<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.879> of<00:02:44.909> my<00:02:45.090> biggest<00:02:45.359> gripes<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
think one of my biggest gripes is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.699 
think one of my biggest gripes is
probably<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.040> head<00:02:48.019> for<00:02:49.019> starters<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.439> head

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
probably the head for starters the head

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.449 
probably the head for starters the head
is<00:02:49.890> really<00:02:50.549> small<00:02:50.969> and<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:52.349> would<00:02:52.829> say<00:02:53.069> really

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
is really small and I would say really

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.720 
is really small and I would say really
long<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.480> well<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> don't<00:02:55.140> know<00:02:55.620> why<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
long as well I don't know why it's so

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.839 
long as well I don't know why it's so
long<00:02:57.239> even<00:02:57.720> when<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> take<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.260> ears<00:02:59.010> off<00:02:59.340> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
long even when you take the ears off it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.160 
long even when you take the ears off it
seems<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.209> Batman<00:03:00.510> has<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.659> really<00:03:00.989> long<00:03:01.379> head

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
seems like Batman has a really long head

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
seems like Batman has a really long head
the<00:03:04.170> grapes<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.799> had<00:03:05.069> with<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.370> Mattel

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the grapes that I had with the Mattel

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
the grapes that I had with the Mattel
version<00:03:06.389> of<00:03:06.510> Batman<00:03:06.870> again<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.920> carry

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
version of Batman again really carry

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.640 
version of Batman again really carry
over<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.939> figure<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.810> back<00:03:10.170> end<00:03:10.439> loan

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
over to this figure the back end loan

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.520 
over to this figure the back end loan
isn't<00:03:11.639> bad<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.689> it<00:03:12.870> seems<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.379> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
isn't bad but it just it seems like it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.569 
isn't bad but it just it seems like it's
just<00:03:13.650> really<00:03:14.040> big<00:03:16.069> proportionately<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.220> would

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
just really big proportionately I would

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.869 
just really big proportionately I would
say<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.849> majority<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.389> figure<00:03:18.659> is<00:03:18.810> just

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
say the majority of the figure is just

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.629 
say the majority of the figure is just
awkward<00:03:21.169> like<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.319> torso<00:03:23.099> section<00:03:23.519> just

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
awkward like the torso section just

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.110 
awkward like the torso section just
seemed<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.419> really<00:03:24.750> big<00:03:25.489> versus<00:03:26.489> his<00:03:26.730> head

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
seemed really really big versus his head

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.050 
seemed really really big versus his head
his<00:03:27.450> head<00:03:27.689> seems<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.319> should<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.530> bigger

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
his head seems like it should be bigger

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.300 
his head seems like it should be bigger
but<00:03:30.060> perhaps<00:03:30.450> maybe<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:31.019> as<00:03:31.260> long<00:03:31.799> if<00:03:32.159> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
but perhaps maybe not as long if that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.000 
but perhaps maybe not as long if that
makes<00:03:32.549> any<00:03:32.700> sense<00:03:33.859> his<00:03:34.859> arms<00:03:35.540> kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.689> big<00:03:37.010> yet

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
makes any sense his arms kind of big yet

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.409 
makes any sense his arms kind of big yet
his<00:03:38.159> legs<00:03:38.459> kind<00:03:39.389> of<00:03:39.540> small<00:03:40.099> he's<00:03:41.209> almost<00:03:42.209> got

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
his legs kind of small he's almost got

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.420 
his legs kind of small he's almost got
like<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.690> gorilla<00:03:43.260> thing<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.949> on<00:03:44.069> where<00:03:44.280> his

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
like a gorilla thing going on where his

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.670 
like a gorilla thing going on where his
his<00:03:45.090> arms<00:03:45.389> though<00:03:45.540> again<00:03:45.870> proportioned

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
his arms though again proportioned

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.369 
his arms though again proportioned
correctly<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:48.120> make<00:03:48.359> seem<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.049> make<00:03:49.229> his

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
correctly just make seem to make his

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.069 
correctly just make seem to make his
legs<00:03:49.799> look<00:03:50.069> really<00:03:50.129> short<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.269> stumpy<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
legs look really short and stumpy I

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.599 
legs look really short and stumpy I
don't<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:52.829> it's<00:03:52.979> because<00:03:53.099> his<00:03:53.340> lower

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
don't know if it's because his lower

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.250 
don't know if it's because his lower
legs<00:03:53.940> aren't<00:03:54.180> long<00:03:54.299> enough<00:03:54.840> maybe<00:03:55.019> they

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
legs aren't long enough maybe they

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.129 
legs aren't long enough maybe they
should<00:03:55.409> be<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.889> about<00:03:56.129> there<00:03:57.139> but

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
should be like to about there but

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.170 
should be like to about there but
something<00:03:58.500> about<00:03:58.859> this<00:03:58.979> figure<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.760> doesn't

the<00:04:27.870> lower<00:04:28.380> foot<00:04:28.830> section<00:04:29.300> certainly<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.419> can

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
the lower foot section certainly you can

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.210 
the lower foot section certainly you can
still<00:04:30.840> bend<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.260> knee<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.740> can<00:04:31.889> rotate

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
still bend the knee and you can rotate

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.620 
still bend the knee and you can rotate

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
at the lower thigh section but like the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.810 
at the lower thigh section but like the
the<00:04:37.110> feet<00:04:37.500> because<00:04:38.280> they<00:04:38.430> don't<00:04:38.699> have

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
the feet because they don't have

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.710 
the feet because they don't have
articulation<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.320> figure<00:04:40.830> can<00:04:41.550> stand<00:04:42.240> but

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
articulation the figure can stand but

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.659 
articulation the figure can stand but
you<00:04:42.810> can't<00:04:42.990> really<00:04:43.110> all<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.740> additional

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
you can't really all this additional

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.459 
you can't really all this additional
articulation<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.509> can't<00:04:45.750> do<00:04:45.870> anything<00:04:46.260> with

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
articulation you can't do anything with

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:47.990 
articulation you can't do anything with
it<00:04:46.500> because<00:04:47.159> he<00:04:47.370> always<00:04:47.550> has<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.849> be

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
it because he always has to be

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.120 
it because he always has to be

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
in the head I would believe that it

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.769 
in the head I would believe that it
would<00:05:05.339> be<00:05:05.489> on<00:05:05.610> a<00:05:05.639> ball<00:05:05.939> joint<00:05:06.269> but<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.539> can't

move the head up and down it's really

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.259 
move the head up and down it's really
only<00:05:08.399> left<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:08.819> right

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:09.269 
only left and right

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
this up but for me I would say it's a

this up but for me I would say it's a

the other figures though the other

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.920 
the other figures though the other
