00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
make because I was thinking I got it in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.399 
make because I was thinking I got it in
the<00:01:48.960> color<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.610> I'm<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.360> like

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409
