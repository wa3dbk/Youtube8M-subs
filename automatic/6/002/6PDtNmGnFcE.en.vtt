00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it's free to download and as I said

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.570 
it's free to download and as I said
mango<00:00:24.300> enabled<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.160> instant

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
mango enabled so it has the instant

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
mango enabled so it has the instant
resuming<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.230> run<00:00:28.650> timers

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
resuming and it can actually run timers

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.240 
resuming and it can actually run timers
in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.609> background<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.990> say<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.830> set<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
in the background so say if we set this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.569 
in the background so say if we set this
timer<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:33.090> seven<00:00:33.630> seconds<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:35.370> can

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
timer for seven seconds there we can

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
timer for seven seconds there we can
just<00:00:35.610> start<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.890> then<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.190> time<00:00:38.430> will

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
just start it and then the time will

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030 
just start it and then the time will
start<00:00:38.969> running<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.410> automatically

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
start running and it also automatically

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
start running and it also automatically
calculates<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:42.059> time<00:00:42.360> it'll<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.899> off<00:00:43.170> there

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
calculates what time it'll go off there

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160 
calculates what time it'll go off there
and<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> displays<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> live<00:00:44.820> tile<00:00:45.180> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and it displays it on the live tile so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.389 
and it displays it on the live tile so
it<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.129> ten<00:00:47.850> seconds<00:00:48.480> late<00:00:48.899> on

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
it can be about like ten seconds late on

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
it can be about like ten seconds late on
firing<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.760> alarm<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> actually<00:00:51.809> quit

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
firing the alarm if you actually quit

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.880 
firing the alarm if you actually quit
out<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:54.440> but<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
out of that out but that's just a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.119 
out of that out but that's just a
restriction<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.730> Windows<00:00:57.390> Phone<00:00:57.629> 7<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
restriction of Windows Phone 7 and it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
restriction of Windows Phone 7 and it's
really<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.430> too<00:00:59.550> bad<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.170> cool

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really not too bad and it's pretty cool

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
really not too bad and it's pretty cool
how<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> actually<00:01:02.039> displays<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.210> right

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
how it actually displays the time right

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
how it actually displays the time right
on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> tile<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> set

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on the tile there it's like if we set

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
on the tile there it's like if we set
this<00:01:06.030> nine<00:01:06.479> minute<00:01:06.780> 41<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.770> 10

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this nine minute 41 that's about 10

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
this nine minute 41 that's about 10
minutes<00:01:08.280> from<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.119> 953<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:10.110> now

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
minutes from now so it's 953 right now

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.600 
minutes from now so it's 953 right now
so<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> set<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so we set that and then you see it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
so we set that and then you see it
calculates<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.710> 1003<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.369> alarm<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.909> off

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
calculates at 1003 the alarm will go off

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
calculates at 1003 the alarm will go off
and<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.680> whatever<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.369> with
