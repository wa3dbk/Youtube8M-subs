00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.699
 good morning we hear maximum rascal 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.550
 work at the petrol engine platform 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.179
 of fiat powertrain technologies 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.179
 they are many engine nansen program 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.789
 many and identifies the new technology developed by fiat 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.230
 plants with office that offers a variety of worlds of regulation 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.570
 bellaria entrance of the swans 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.600
 and with this spirit the mood system is born 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 and with this system we have succeeded in reducing the emissions that have occurred 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.220
 n disks of about 10% compared to conventional throttle motors 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.880
 getting I have a pair increase at the bottom of about 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.110
 15% 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.120
 and to have an average increase of intense power between 5 10% and on 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 power 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.870
 which smokes cooper used motor 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.870
 and of course with player with euro shoes goals 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.140
 what you see framed the motor do many I was turbo 100 35 horses that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.730
 starting from this autumn embajada the alpha myth the versatility in the of 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.740
 Many technologies and area types infect any architecture 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.120
 gasoline or diesel engine and petrol the many way and consists of an oss 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.880
 in forged aluminum that houses several subsystems 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080
 the first of which I just said that puts the rotation in contact 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.930
 of the distribution shaft with the intake valves and this fine role that 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.730
 pass the motion of the cam 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 he has a pump that is pushed from the pole up 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.119
 hydraulic pumping compartments forgotten alternate way inside a chamber 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.700
 high pressure and in its alternating space flows a certain pressure 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.340
 booloo 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 a single cam capable of controlling both intake valves of the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 single click 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.469
 we can have this type of electronic doll control 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.069
 substantially 5 different ways of implementing fairy tales a command 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.159
 let's say valve opening and closing that follows the fixed law classes of the 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.950
 direct commands like what we have on the exhaust or by 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.549
 electronic regulation of the solenoid valve we can have a closure 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.549
 the third mode of operation is anticipated by the suction doll instead 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.199
 suction valve opening delay with respect to the angle of 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.439
 project 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.980
 or the possibility of having a double lift in a single phase 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:54.280
 suction 10 minutes fifth mode of operation and of course the way that 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.880
 provides for closure 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.239
 throughout the intake phase in the intake valves 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.249
 and obviously everything is closed with a distribution cover 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.789
 with or 4 sleeves which obviously serve to separate from the external environment 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.369
 the candles of each other of each cylinder 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.460
 all then 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.560
 includes the new live depressor and the new turbocharger 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 used for monsters application 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.479
 what you see here is a promoter room where we have developed 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.929
 multi air file engine calibration 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:49.799
 in this test room the 5 valve adjustment strategies are not finished 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.509
 aspiration is more appropriate in order to minimize consumption 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.289
 engine specific obviously get the maximum in terms of even 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.119
 performance then power quotas
