00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.380
 the next creation of my good 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.910
 friend Igor everyones this time igor 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.430
 make the cranial thing that me again 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.730
 not only shook the quality 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 execution of the form to all the rest 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.429
 always just awesome false in general 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 Today we will talk about this let's say more 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.559
 noble more noble sketches 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.500
 on applegate estimator 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 this here there are such a dagger now and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.370
 make a gerber make them a boker applet 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.829
 in general during the second world war 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.680
 the British used such a battle 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 layout based on this dagger which 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 also developed applegate in general it seems 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.520
 it 's q big tennis racket but 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 already in the 90s something was already done 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.930
 mean between applegate dagger and here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.799
 these bows called this thing 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.240
 tactical means playing it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 looks like this 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 as always just awesome 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.040
 making embossed colored sheath 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.180
 special stain for skin such here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.829
 such a nice color did it all so 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.540
 neatly it is very high quality and 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.909
 flash and here is the stamping 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.210
 something like a dragon you look how much 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.780
 very neatly done and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.630
 Rome and the world strap as made clasp 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.680
 and how good the fit is that it is nowhere 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 not hanging out crunches nothing 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.659
 Igor still did just such a thing 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.009
 he likes to always make the rest of his skin 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.739
 Well, some such fenichki let's say this with 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.250
 same embossed as here on the knife 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.819
 it is not something to hang it here pulled 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.129
 over the countrywoman but the less in general is 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:23.440
 all skin is all the same but now 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:27.940
 let's talk more about the dagger means here 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:33.160
 zastezhechka such here we have it all here 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.829
 neatly done no it's not a spider 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.410
 kaetani spider hall 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.890
 Such a thing is on the original in general 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.030
 here is such here such here is dagger 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.870
 so here he sits in his hand he 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.720
 double-edged very well sharpened on 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.790
 dagger checks made then old man with us 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.090
 440c 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.030
 sharpened very fine red-hot about 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.590
 by 58 units 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.730
 we take it all the time in the same 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.920
 the place I bring Igor steel q well igor 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.810
 from them to do all sorts of wonderful crafts 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:22.209
 here in the butt of 5 millimeters such here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.150
 interesting dagger means in this 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.970
 time we did without inserts from red 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.709
 fiber so as not to do all the time one and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.000
 also 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.380
 grip this here maybe someone saw 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.569
 on the channel the ideal grip for sergey from 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.420
 Moscow on the blade 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.189
 Biryukova why did he send me a cool 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.319
 such a piece of wood and now there are trimming 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.590
 because the weight lifters were so healthy 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.319
 I asked Igor to give them and I were 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.269
 here's a cut and green card well here 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.030
 igor him so their very interesting 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.120
 docked 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.819
 super before you get the knife 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.859
 sharpened on the rough we had time to chop 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:10.230
 I eat meat just where Igor works 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:13.900
 tom slapped a pig and at all we tried 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.919
 sprinkled blood before him why well for meat 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.449
 it works great like that 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.579
 double-edged very such a powerful thing 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.949
 one word mixture itz translates 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.009
 like do not wear Cach that if I do not know how 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.669
 more correct translate in general here 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:34.830
 such an interesting thing such here 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:38.229
 wonderful making what we can 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.590
 the blade itself, well, as if I don't know when 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:45.250
 I saw this project I thought it would be very 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.780
 interesting but here we have seen and 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.570
 titanium knife from Igor and knife reaper here's a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.240
 this we will call tactical to moisten the general 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.659
 I have such pins what you saw 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.300
 exactly 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.240
 Igor taught me to do this thing 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.520
 his trick he taught me how to do it 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.370
 slightly interfere with what was like this 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.310
 black fill but only here Igor 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.800
 even if you look also the rods from 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.070
 stainless steel stand so there generally 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.500
 aerobatics grip nothing 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.180
 lacquer is nothing it's all just soaked 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.750
 oiled and polished 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.479
 the finest sandpaper quality 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:31.240
 making yourself you see here too that 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:34.509
 on i'm this brass duct carry my hand 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.630
 sits just very comfortable and igor bye 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:41.229
 sharpened him twice, so I 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.070
 also so very wary of him therefore 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.070
 thank you all
