00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello i am today with jules 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 oenologist at home our lives our then he 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.480
 will show you how to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.210
 what a wine makes and especially why 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 look good hello then all 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 wines decanter style no 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 all socar wines aftis of the same 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.480
 way either we will try to see 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 together in what case it takes because a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
 makes a wine and why 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 basically we have two styles of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 different carafes for two uses 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 different the first I put 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 two here the carafes to air the wine on 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.579
 call it counters in English 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 they usually have a very wide base 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.309
 to promote the flow of wine and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 his aeration in a carafe 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 I would have a tendency to focus on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 carafes not too flared when we miss 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 of place 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.649
 this one for example is made to air 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 on May 20 it takes a little less than 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.260
 place it will be ventilated a little less but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.850
 enough and on a reduced table 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.650
 she's pretty practical the second 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 carafes family carafe carafe 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.010
 decant 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.140
 they do not know how to ventilate the 20th 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 serve to separate the solid part that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 rush to the bottom of the bottle and the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
 liquid part of the wine in these cases there and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.840
 I showed you an example here have 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 privileged carafes that are not going 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 at all to elven so they are pretty 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.040
 high and very narrow 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.110
 let's see now what wine is needed because 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.170
 makes two styles of wines are decanted 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.880
 everything else is rather to avoid 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.740
 how we know if we have to pretend because 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 there is no secret must taste 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 and so feel it to sell because did a 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.740
 wine you have to open the bottle as 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.009
 I did and without pouring a background in the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.340
 green to test it I have there 1,22 loire to 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340
 these young people 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.780
 no need to pay a small lot 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.320
 background enough to test it to the dress 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.640
 it is a rather pale enough pale wine in 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 general the wines do not need it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.079
 to be decanter and I'm going to smell it for 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.550
 check if it's a wine that needs to 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.170
 to be on the nose 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 we are very open that is to say that it 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.710
 smells good it seems the fruit so I 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.070
 I would say hold this wine I do not really 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.110
 need 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.900
 the carafe I'll taste it could 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.510
 really be sure of my shot but 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.770
 normally I do not need in mouth a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 rather light fruity wind ready to drink 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.310
 I do not hide it comes to us 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.900
 you will explain why I keep 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.670
 my role I go because did the wine for 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.270
 improve it is not fair to do 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.220
 pleasure in the eyes this wine is light it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.950
 was verified at the sight in the nose and in 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.200
 mouth it is fruity is open 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.540
 he is very young I took a vintage 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 2009 they say he's ready to drink 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.990
 it's a wine after having opened and light 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.620
 I do not carafe on the contrary I will 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.590
 must carafe and the 20 young born 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.200
 closed on themselves very intense not 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.150
 very pleasant on the nose and a little hard in 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.530
 mouth is the case of another wine than 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.530
 I chose this chaos 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.959
 he is very focused and needs to be 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.820
 opened by a ventilation shed you can 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:28.380
 check to the eye that this wine is very 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.330
 concentrated in the nose and in the mouth I 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.010
 check right away we have 20 a little 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.160
 folded on itself is a little hard to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.160
 see 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.840
 they say he's tight he's a little 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.880
 tannic dries gums 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.050
 the aeration of lanka will allow him to 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.810
 open to aerate 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.890
 it's a ben actually who is too young 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.280
 it 's not good to drink right now 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.580
 the very good ones and not out of the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.920
 bottle 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.780
 you have to give him some air a little 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 of oxygen and that's the purpose of this card 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.480
 for that sort of thing it's very simple 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.410
 first open a small drop of wine 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.410
 for in town and caf 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.780
 this little drop of wine I'm going to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.820
 rotate in the carafe 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.910
 in order to stick to all the walls at 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.620
 what's the use after removing the dust 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.630
 and the gongs could have taken the carafe 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.870
 in the order of its storage in a 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.820
 closet I throw in the bucket and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.860
 now the carafe is ready to 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.930
 receive the good wine for aeration 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.730
 you do not have to be delicate wine 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.140
 is closed on himself he needs 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.210
 to be open so we can go 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.770
 franco where I take the bottle and the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.110
 decanter that I hold and I will do 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 it's my wine pretty fast way in 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.130
 the carafe so we can go free 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.350
 just do not get over the cajas 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.690
 have studied for not that it goes back the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.140
 see wine running down its walls 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.180
 so that's what will allow it in 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.410
 to improve its aromas and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:00.820
 to soften darker the carafe 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.140
 serves to brought what an aging 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.669
 bottle a little longer extended would have 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.660
 did you tell me how long 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.070
 at the front because at 120 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.310
 how long do you have to leave that 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.320
 would go well it depends more 20 when 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.590
 you have tasted it is closed on him 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.690
 even 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.430
 hard to see anymore he'll have to put it 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.050
 a long time in a jug then my time 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.210
 what are these two hours for example 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.340
 in general it is largely sufficient for 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.919
 most closed wines most of the time 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.340
 half an hour an hour of aeration 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.430
 carafe 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.490
 especially if it is very wide and very 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.350
 enough so obviously you have to taste 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.630
 a young wine that we think feels very 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.540
 often Bordeaux wine Cahors 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.800
 Languedoc or Côtes du Rhône the 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.830
 Stride tasting a little before the meal 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.570
 let's now see the case of a wine that did not 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.270
 no need to be ventilated at all this is 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.250
 more a young wine is an old wine 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.229
 I chose a wine from an old 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.060
 vintages of the year 2000 as for 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.760
 the others I'm going to pour one 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:02.729
 drop in my glass to test it to 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:07.000
 the view I check that his dress testifies 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:10.630
 a great clarity and a hue a 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.300
 little orange we say oiled laroque testifies 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.310
 of its aging 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.270
 od it is very open very aromatic 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.770
 very fragrant 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:25.550
 and in the mouth it is already pleasant to 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.930
 drink will say balanced that is not with 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.660
 tannins very dry like the other 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.450
 in fact this wine is already open I have 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.080
 so you do not need the airy carafe 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.370
 it's just the damaged it is fragile and 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.110
 precious it was kept in its 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.440
 bottle for ten years he's ready to 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.570
 to drink 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.150
 it's useless to pass it in a 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.530
 decanter to wander as he is old he is 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780
 possible that I have at the bottom of the 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.210
 bottle a deposit the color in 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.960
 fading with age deposits a deposit 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.900
 at the bottom of the bottle 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.420
 it can be unpleasant to have it in 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.340
 green so if you're afraid to put 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.760
 deposit in the green of your guests to 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.880
 table 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.520
 you can then pass it in carafe to 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.440
 decant decant it's just separated the 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.020
 this deposit of the bottom of the bottle of the 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.630
 liquid that is an interior decant the 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.670
 bottle if your wine has been stirred that does not 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.650
 useless it is necessary that the wine was 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.810
 rest at least a good day before 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.730
 as the wine is fragile this 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.850
 settlement will take place in cases 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:25.760
 grave decanted the carafes narrow or 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.940
 carafes with a plug which is to 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.440
 will do the gesture will do it in a delicate way not 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.900
 as for aeration 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.370
 just before going to table since the 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.620
 wine does not need to be altered by 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.680
 seem to be airy waves and when so 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.840
 just at the time of service a violent in 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.510
 conclusion I do not need a carafe 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.240
 ventilated only for the 20 unpleasant young 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.900
 noses closed on themselves for the 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.700
 decantation 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.950
 they are different carafes 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.410
 reserved for old fashion wines 

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:57.040
 optional is always to use 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.040
 gently
