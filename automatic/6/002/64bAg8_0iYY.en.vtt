00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.640
 Marha country level percent I speak though not been named 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.099
 it was expected of her 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.150
 and the year many people are wondering how merchants have millions 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.849
 that the answer 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.909
 only from afar 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.979
 That's the way it looks best to grow the pay 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.429
 it's about newspapers 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.160
 as you can see now the millions need their sexy one more 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 other field that is 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.570
 they always need at least two mistakes 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 and clearer the main field landed somewhere that means he has to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 have at least one box 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.610
 so that the melon can sit for approx 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.760
 Having a lax again TUI Anniversary is perfect 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.290
 so 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.710
 dapd Borgmeier demanded farmland that must be wet so as I said 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.000
 Satire built on a beautiful lake 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.570
 yes, if he is so wet 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.140
 Although you can see it gets darker you put the DAX whose millions 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 in the middle no 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 and the nature and duration of the Toyota I believe that there is the DAX DAX change 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.490
 the way is worth dax and then Rome starts on the sideline 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 just as there are 17 with its side and then you go in the bright 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 how important Madrid 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.690
 I know apparently have finally move out 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.670
 Euro us 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
 the million percent way 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.450
 there is now 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 there is not any more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.060
 but all these replaced as yet squatters then continues again when you do that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 then Wilders is then soprano I do not want to take 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690
 Here I can be here in front 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.390
 take out a melon and turn it into a Sam 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.340
 Now you have a trust here 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 I could not do that to you anymore, you're one broken 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.989
 That's the Research recommend it goes faster 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.169
 two solos Nordstadt not that you described exactly 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.870
 missing balls say rushed setter puts that new setter 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.060
 I did not know that he actually puts the text and dial is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.709
 works pretty well 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.709
 the Bologna close her go right 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.489
 Tron given a Hein Koehler right down 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.510
 and the kind of punks definitely that works the other to DEG videos 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.509
 I've now seen Syria's Big-lark year so the animal works out though 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.329
 In any case, he has seen 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.489
 Darcy one came up 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.839
 In addition, eleven illness billion dollar deal 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.739
 that's how it works 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.709
 it is wrong to please 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.179
 is not feasible too 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:02.869
 Bass for the next time
