during<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.100> dynasty<00:01:47.579> years<00:01:47.790> late

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
during their dynasty years late

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
during their dynasty years late
seventies<00:01:48.540> early<00:01:48.689> eighties<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.409> if

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
seventies early eighties I think if

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
seventies early eighties I think if
anybody<00:01:49.740> had<00:01:50.009> ever<00:01:50.100> said<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:50.790> there

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
anybody had ever said to you then there

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
anybody had ever said to you then there
there<00:01:51.240> would<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.420> teams<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> league<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there would be teams in this league in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520 
there would be teams in this league in
Baltimore<00:01:53.280> Sacramento<00:01:54.000> Vegas<00:01:54.600> wherever<00:01:55.290> else

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
Baltimore Sacramento Vegas wherever else

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
Baltimore Sacramento Vegas wherever else
you'd<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.130> thought<00:01:56.399> their<00:01:56.579> medication

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you'd have thought their medication

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.000 
you'd have thought their medication
would<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.600> changed

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
would have to be changed

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.800 
would have to be changed
I<00:01:58.130> would<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.850> probably<00:01:58.940> gone<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.420> cut<00:01:59.540> take

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
I would have probably gone and cut take

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.120 
I would have probably gone and cut take
some<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.170> medication<00:02:00.800> that<00:02:00.920> they<00:02:01.070> were

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
some of that medication that they were

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.370 
some of that medication that they were
all<00:02:01.400> but<00:02:01.940> at<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.150> point<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.810> would<00:02:03.140> never

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
all but at this point I would never

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.320 
all but at this point I would never
thought<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.130> CFL<00:02:04.520> had<00:02:04.670> expanded<00:02:05.030> down

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
thought that the CFL had expanded down

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.060 
thought that the CFL had expanded down
to<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.660> south<00:02:05.900> but<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.620> case<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:07.010> think

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
to the south but in this case I think

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.859 
to the south but in this case I think
it's<00:02:07.370> absolutely<00:02:07.610> wonderful<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.510> I<00:02:08.630> think

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
it's absolutely wonderful and I think

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.020 
it's absolutely wonderful and I think
it's<00:02:08.990> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> enhance<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.040> CFL<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.729> it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
it's going to enhance the CFL and it's

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.910 
it's going to enhance the CFL and it's
going<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.240> enhance<00:02:11.600> football<00:02:12.170> period<00:02:12.590> Don

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
going to enhance football period Don

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.050 
going to enhance football period Don

at the last 30 seconds hey I've called
games<00:02:23.690> where<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.020> thought<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.440> were<00:02:24.500> over

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710

with<00:02:24.950> three<00:02:25.250> minutes<00:02:25.400> left<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> team

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
with three minutes left with the team

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.060 
with three minutes left with the team
trailing<00:02:26.690> by<00:02:26.810> two<00:02:26.870> or<00:02:27.140> three<00:02:27.350> touchdowns<00:02:27.830> and

one of the key things for any future
