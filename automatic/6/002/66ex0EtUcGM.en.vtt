you take a picture it'll show the image
you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:06.360> set<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.780> two<00:02:06.930> seconds<00:02:07.380> four

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you can set it for two seconds four

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.790 
you can set it for two seconds four
seconds<00:02:08.220> eight<00:02:08.369> seconds<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.569> hold<00:02:09.840> or

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
seconds eight seconds have it hold or

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
seconds eight seconds have it hold or
you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.430> turn<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> off<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.540> two

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
you can turn that off I like it on two

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
you can turn that off I like it on two
seconds<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.260> take<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> quick

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
seconds so I can take a quick

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.600 
seconds so I can take a quick
glance<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.310> my<00:02:14.490> histogram<00:02:19.250> next<00:02:20.250> section<00:02:20.550> over

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
glance at my histogram next section over

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.120 
glance at my histogram next section over
here<00:02:21.350> starts<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.590> auto<00:02:22.800> exposure

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
here starts off with auto exposure

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.350 
here starts off with auto exposure
bracketing<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:27.030> actually

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
bracketing to do this this actually

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 
bracketing to do this this actually
takes<00:02:27.600> three<00:02:27.900> shots<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.290> any<00:02:28.560> image<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.490> any

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.160 
takes three shots of any image or any
scene<00:02:32.300> actually<00:02:33.300> you'll<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.840> minus

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
scene actually you'll see it's at minus

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.480 
scene actually you'll see it's at minus
one<00:02:34.350> right<00:02:34.530> now<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.070> my<00:02:35.190> exposure

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
one right now because I have my exposure

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.970 
one right now because I have my exposure

back<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.860> zero<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.110> goes<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> zero

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
back up to zero so now it goes to zero

you<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:48.960> highlights<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you get the good highlights and
