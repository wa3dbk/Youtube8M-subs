00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.630
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 sn includes hardware and software 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.340
 reviews today with the installation of e 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.260
 mails in between xp home server enclosures 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.369
 in the event 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 and before we get here with the installation 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.859
 we have to stop the mainboard 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.929
 of course, still the blind block of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.430
 inside roughly said that I like that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.440
 The principle is always that way 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 connections are right when the computer 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.350
 for example, or if it is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.980
 the audio connections below are yes this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 tie is simply placed bend 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 of course you should now the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 respective cards together or to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.199
 page insert that now for example in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 could be gone 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.500
 and then it just will not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 pass away club and already sitting 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 the aperture for the mainboard firmly so 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm back again 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.490
 Now that we have the motto the io 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 have installed the blind direct the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 of course, the mainboard out there as well 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.530
 from here we have the mammoth velvet cpu 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 and memory etc 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 and how is the foreign says 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 now need the audio connections from 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.840
 this word down here 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.590
 You can almost do that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 we here and we have to start and that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.829
 then carefully put down all 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:49.070
 the mainboard spacer lounge chair 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.070
 are attached by bitfenix itself 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.610
 and then it just becomes 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.270
 screwed on so it goes with the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.770
 prescription of the mainboard in the housing 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.860
 yes, I apologize for that but 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.240
 easy to show now 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 I now have the mainboard 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.730
 with two women in front or fixed 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.440
 since that is a bit difficult so 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.200
 it goes on and two billion euros 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.600
 shrinks you are and there still behind 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 a screw to install the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.970
 Screw many uses are like this 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.150
 if I do that I have shown 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.430
 and yes for easy installation 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:45.090
 I just go up this one 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:48.630
 taken dust filter and thus something 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.340
 then also much easier from the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.970
 go hand 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.550
 especially here in the back of the picture 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 we have a screw here in the back 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.830
 and that was a bit harder with 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.420
 screwdriver and so, yes, I think 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.220
 but that was last to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.230
 installation of the mainboard in one 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.270
 participate as the housing 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 I 'm always paying attention to that 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.130
 first the blender installs then 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.100
 properly align mainboard and that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.440
 to cautious whole and not 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.959
 Too tight so come therefore too firm 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.750
 off and damaged in the case was that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.980
 mainboard and then it is kalin 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.930
 I thank you at this point 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.730
 For to see would comment with Lou 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.470
 valuation and what pleased Subscribe 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.480
 besides, I should be very happy if 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.900
 the next time at the next part 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.060
 this series of wisdom again 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.060
 and yes your skin purely political
