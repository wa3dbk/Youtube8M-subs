00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
let's take a look at the page menu

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.300 
let's take a look at the page menu

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
setting of your Lawrence hds gen2 to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.910 
setting of your Lawrence hds gen2 to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
access that just hit mini twice and our

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.939 
access that just hit mini twice and our
second<00:00:15.250> option<00:00:15.370> is<00:00:15.670> page<00:00:16.140> our<00:00:17.140> page<00:00:17.439> settings

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
second option is page our page settings

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.460 
second option is page our page settings
we<00:00:18.189> can<00:00:18.430> change<00:00:18.699> our<00:00:18.939> data<00:00:19.180> overlay<00:00:19.869> we<00:00:20.289> could

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
we can change our data overlay we could

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.470 
we can change our data overlay we could
turn<00:00:20.650> it<00:00:20.710> on<00:00:20.920> or<00:00:21.070> off<00:00:21.100> we<00:00:21.490> even<00:00:21.820> edit<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.300> data

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
turn it on or off we even edit the data

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.410 
turn it on or off we even edit the data
overlay<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:23.350> let's<00:00:23.530> do<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.910> when<00:00:24.910> we<00:00:25.000> go<00:00:25.150> into

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
overlay so let's do that when we go into

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.180 
overlay so let's do that when we go into
here<00:00:25.600> you'll<00:00:25.750> see<00:00:25.930> that<00:00:26.080> this<00:00:26.289> is<00:00:26.560> highlighted

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
here you'll see that this is highlighted

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.220 
here you'll see that this is highlighted
so<00:00:27.340> we<00:00:27.460> could<00:00:27.640> change<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.300> or<00:00:28.539> we<00:00:29.080> could

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
so we could change that or we could

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.580 
so we could change that or we could
change<00:00:29.440> this<00:00:29.770> one<00:00:30.070> or<00:00:30.730> we<00:00:31.480> could<00:00:31.660> add<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:32.259> whole

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
change this one or we could add a whole

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.069 
change this one or we could add a whole
new<00:00:32.619> data<00:00:33.039> overlay<00:00:33.550> by<00:00:33.730> hitting<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.930> Add

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
new data overlay by hitting the Add

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.930 
new data overlay by hitting the Add
button<00:00:35.109> we<00:00:35.829> could<00:00:35.979> change<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.519> current<00:00:36.789> one

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
button we could change the current one

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.349 
button we could change the current one
that<00:00:36.969> we're<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:38.010> type<00:00:39.010> digital<00:00:39.879> or<00:00:40.030> we<00:00:40.149> can<00:00:40.300> do

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
that we're on type digital or we can do

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.950 
that we're on type digital or we can do
an<00:00:40.479> analog<00:00:40.870> display<00:00:41.190> size<00:00:42.190> small<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.420> then

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
an analog display size small and then

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.139 
an analog display size small and then
save<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:44.829> let's<00:00:45.219> take<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.429> look<00:00:45.579> at<00:00:45.729> this<00:00:45.909> one

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
save so let's take a look at this one

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.090 
save so let's take a look at this one
here<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.569> could<00:00:46.719> change<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.050> from<00:00:47.260> small<00:00:47.530> to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
here we could change it from small to

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.229 
here we could change it from small to
medium<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:49.089> large<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:50.139> enormous<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:52.120> we'll

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
medium to large to enormous so we'll

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.430 
medium to large to enormous so we'll
leave<00:00:52.329> it<00:00:52.389> that<00:00:52.510> small<00:00:55.019> we<00:00:56.019> do<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.789> type

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
leave it that small we do the type

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.430 
leave it that small we do the type
analog<00:00:59.440> or<00:00:59.709> digital<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.690> could<00:01:01.839> change<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:05.290> can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
analog or digital we could change we can

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.260 
analog or digital we could change we can
make<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.799> one<00:01:05.950> say<00:01:06.930> depth<00:01:07.930> instead<00:01:08.320> or<00:01:09.270> we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
make that one say depth instead or we

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.320 
make that one say depth instead or we
can<00:01:10.420> add<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> whole<00:01:10.930> new<00:01:10.960> data<00:01:11.500> field<00:01:12.300> so<00:01:13.300> let's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
can add a whole new data field so let's

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:25.860 
can add a whole new data field so let's
say<00:01:13.720> we<00:01:13.870> need<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.920> time<00:01:18.030> an<00:01:19.030> excellent<00:01:24.870> we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
say we need the time an excellent we

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.480 
say we need the time an excellent we
could<00:01:26.050> use<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.380> zoom<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.130> zoom<00:01:27.190> out<00:01:27.430> buttons

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
could use a zoom in and zoom out buttons

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.730 
could use a zoom in and zoom out buttons
to<00:01:28.180> change<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.720> size<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:31.620> instead<00:01:32.620> of

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
to change the size of it instead of

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.290 
to change the size of it instead of
using<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.190> button<00:01:33.490> down<00:01:33.670> here<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:37.270> we

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
using the button down here and if we

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.240 
using the button down here and if we
want<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.660> keep<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.050> data<00:01:38.350> field<00:01:38.740> we<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.100> hit

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
want to keep that data field we just hit

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.740 
want to keep that data field we just hit
save<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:41.020> has<00:01:41.140> been<00:01:41.290> saved<00:01:42.480> so<00:01:43.480> let's<00:01:43.630> go

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
save and that has been saved so let's go

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.570 
save and that has been saved so let's go
back<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.200> our<00:01:44.380> page<00:01:44.620> menu<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:48.070> could<00:01:48.280> adjust

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
back to our page menu we could adjust

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.880 
back to our page menu we could adjust
the<00:01:48.700> panel<00:01:49.090> sizes<00:01:49.360> through<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:50.590> if<00:01:50.680> we<00:01:50.710> go

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the panel sizes through here so if we go

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.680 
the panel sizes through here so if we go
ENTER<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.460> could<00:01:51.580> adjust<00:01:51.970> each<00:01:52.240> one<00:01:52.480> of<00:01:52.600> these

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
ENTER we could adjust each one of these

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.620 
ENTER we could adjust each one of these
so<00:01:53.050> we<00:01:53.830> got<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.040> split<00:01:54.310> screen<00:01:54.820> right<00:01:55.180> now<00:01:55.390> I'm

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
so we got a split screen right now I'm

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.250 
so we got a split screen right now I'm
on<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:56.170> structure<00:01:56.980> scan<00:01:57.159> down<00:01:57.790> imaging<00:01:58.540> so<00:01:58.930> I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
on the structure scan down imaging so I

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.070 
on the structure scan down imaging so I
could<00:01:59.890> have<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.220> half<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.610> half<00:02:00.790> or<00:02:01.180> 70/30

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
could have it half and half or 70/30

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.100 
could have it half and half or 70/30
6040<00:02:02.950> kind<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.250> thing<00:02:03.400> just<00:02:04.210> move<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.570> hit

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
6040 kind of thing just move it hit

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.899 
6040 kind of thing just move it hit
enter<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.740> it's<00:02:06.010> moved<00:02:06.360> next<00:02:07.360> thing<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:09.700> up<00:02:09.789> to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
enter and it's moved next thing go up to

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.649 
enter and it's moved next thing go up to
page<00:02:10.149> again<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:11.409> have<00:02:11.680> serious<00:02:12.249> audio<00:02:12.670> if<00:02:12.999> you

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
page again we have serious audio if you

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.530 
page again we have serious audio if you
have<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.170> sonic<00:02:14.920> hub<00:02:15.129> hooked<00:02:15.430> up<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.359> can

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
have a sonic hub hooked up you can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.700 
have a sonic hub hooked up you can
enable<00:02:16.989> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
enable this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.330 
enable this
I<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:20.140> have<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.290> sonic<00:02:20.710> hub<00:02:20.860> hooked<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.310> so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I don't have a sonic hub hooked up so

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.090 
I don't have a sonic hub hooked up so
it's<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> fail<00:02:22.420> here<00:02:22.720> eventually<00:02:23.320> so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
it's going to fail here eventually so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.260 
it's going to fail here eventually so
that<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> quick<00:02:24.520> look<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:24.910> your<00:02:24.940> page

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
that was a quick look at your page

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.960 
that was a quick look at your page
