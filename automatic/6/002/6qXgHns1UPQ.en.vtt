of the playing field here is pretty damn
large<00:06:41.669> i<00:06:42.620> think<00:06:43.620> that<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:43.980> game<00:06:44.130> designers

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
large i think that the game designers

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.810 
large i think that the game designers
missed<00:06:44.940> an<00:06:45.060> opportunity<00:06:45.180> here<00:06:45.810> to<00:06:46.550> cover<00:06:47.550> this

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
missed an opportunity here to cover this

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.740 
missed an opportunity here to cover this
floor<00:06:48.150> in<00:06:48.300> ice<00:06:48.630> and<00:06:49.470> put<00:06:49.680> some<00:06:49.800> spikes<00:06:50.160> around

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
floor in ice and put some spikes around

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.670 
floor in ice and put some spikes around
that<00:06:51.750> would<00:06:51.900> have<00:06:51.990> made<00:06:52.080> this<00:06:52.230> possum<00:06:52.590> I'd

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
that would have made this possum I'd

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.270 
that would have made this possum I'd
challenging<00:06:53.160> but<00:06:53.669> as<00:06:54.000> it<00:06:54.270> stands<00:06:54.570> now

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.150

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.559 

we've<00:07:02.160> already<00:07:02.310> had<00:07:02.520> more<00:07:02.819> inventive<00:07:03.090> bosses

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569
