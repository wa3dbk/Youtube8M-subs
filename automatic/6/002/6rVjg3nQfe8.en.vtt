between<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:34.119> then<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.150> think<00:01:35.510> you<00:01:35.630> have<00:01:35.869> to

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900

between you and then I think you have to
try<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.530> go<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:40.420> website<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:42.650> your<00:01:42.680> browser

try to go to a a website to your browser

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.850 
try to go to a a website to your browser
click<00:01:43.580> on<00:01:43.759> guest<00:01:44.000> login<00:01:46.330> as<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> security

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.530 

and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.220> think<00:01:55.970> this<00:01:56.120> should<00:01:56.300> work<00:01:56.360> right

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
and then I think this should work right

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.100 
and then I think this should work right
now<00:01:59.950> see<00:02:00.950> they<00:02:01.640> actually<00:02:01.910> changed<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.750> ma
