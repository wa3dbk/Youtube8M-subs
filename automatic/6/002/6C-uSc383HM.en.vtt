00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
that we're done with the mountain we can

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.170 
that we're done with the mountain we can
begin<00:03:40.600> creating<00:03:40.930> some<00:03:41.380> nice<00:03:41.590> foreground<00:03:42.400> so

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
begin creating some nice foreground so

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.110 
begin creating some nice foreground so
I'll<00:03:43.270> just<00:03:43.450> tap<00:03:43.720> maybe<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.830> grass<00:03:45.430> very

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
I'll just tap maybe this is grass very

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.830 
I'll just tap maybe this is grass very
very<00:03:46.810> far<00:03:47.170> away<00:03:50.910> maybe<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.180> grass<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.660> kind

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
very far away maybe this grass it kind

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.600 
very far away maybe this grass it kind
of<00:03:52.870> comes<00:03:53.140> all<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.680> way<00:03:53.800> across<00:03:54.490> that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
of comes all the way across that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.720 
of comes all the way across that
mountain<00:03:55.240> there<00:03:55.440> let<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.590> brush<00:03:56.860> down<00:03:57.100> and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
mountain there let that brush down and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.700 
mountain there let that brush down and
load<00:03:58.240> up<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.740> fan<00:03:59.740> brush<00:03:59.950> with<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.520> same<00:04:00.730> color

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
load up a fan brush with the same color

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.430 
load up a fan brush with the same color
we<00:04:02.710> can<00:04:02.830> do<00:04:02.980> little<00:04:03.310> tiny<00:04:03.870> distant<00:04:04.870> evergreens

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
we can do little tiny distant evergreens

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.480 
we can do little tiny distant evergreens
growing<00:04:06.400> right<00:04:06.730> up<00:04:06.880> from<00:04:07.120> that<00:04:07.240> grass<00:04:11.460> we<00:04:12.460> can

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
growing right up from that grass we can

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.600 
growing right up from that grass we can
also<00:04:12.820> add<00:04:13.240> in<00:04:13.270> some<00:04:14.140> nice<00:04:14.610> detailed

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
also add in some nice detailed

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.750 
also add in some nice detailed
evergreens<00:04:16.470> simply<00:04:17.470> by<00:04:17.620> pushing<00:04:17.859> up<00:04:18.160> on<00:04:18.489> that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
evergreens simply by pushing up on that

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.950 
evergreens simply by pushing up on that
fan<00:04:19.060> brush<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:21.040> draw<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.580> little<00:04:21.790> line<00:04:21.960> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
fan brush just draw a little line and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.290 
fan brush just draw a little line and
push<00:04:23.530> up<00:04:23.740> create<00:04:24.640> all<00:04:24.820> these<00:04:25.000> nice<00:04:25.270> little

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
push up create all these nice little

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.120 
push up create all these nice little
limbs<00:04:27.240> less<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.600> less<00:04:28.690> detail<00:04:29.230> as<00:04:29.770> they<00:04:29.980> go

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
limbs less and less detail as they go

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.530 
limbs less and less detail as they go
back<00:04:30.340> let<00:04:31.150> them<00:04:31.270> fade<00:04:31.540> off<00:04:31.750> into<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.170> distance

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
back let them fade off into the distance

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.820 
back let them fade off into the distance
now<00:04:34.540> while<00:04:34.780> we're<00:04:34.960> tapping<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.620> dark

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
now while we're tapping in the dark

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.190 
now while we're tapping in the dark
color<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:37.090> may<00:04:37.240> as<00:04:37.300> well<00:04:37.390> just<00:04:37.540> finish<00:04:37.960> this<00:04:38.140> up

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
color we may as well just finish this up

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.890 
color we may as well just finish this up
I<00:04:38.820> went<00:04:39.820> ahead<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.180> just<00:04:40.270> sketched<00:04:40.570> in<00:04:40.810> a

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
I went ahead and just sketched in a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.620 
I went ahead and just sketched in a
little<00:04:41.110> basic<00:04:42.070> idea<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.790> river<00:04:43.090> back<00:04:43.419> in

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
little basic idea of a river back in

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.020 
little basic idea of a river back in
there<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.190> know<00:04:45.340> exactly<00:04:45.669> where

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
there so that we know exactly where

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.999 
there so that we know exactly where
we're<00:04:46.180> going<00:04:46.479> what's<00:04:47.320> sort<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.590> the

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
we're going what's sort of the

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.359 
we're going what's sort of the
that<00:04:48.189> area<00:04:48.430> unpainted<00:04:48.939> for<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.419> while<00:04:50.369> and

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:51.369 
that area unpainted for a while and

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:53.879 
that area unpainted for a while and
we'll<00:04:51.610> just<00:04:51.759> tap<00:04:51.969> a<00:04:52.180> nice<00:04:52.330> dark<00:04:52.749> green<00:04:52.889> around

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
we'll just tap a nice dark green around

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.959 
we'll just tap a nice dark green around
it<00:04:55.229> now<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.259> was<00:04:56.529> looking<00:04:56.830> at<00:04:56.949> this<00:04:57.129> and<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.729> think

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
it now I was looking at this and I think

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.049 
it now I was looking at this and I think
right<00:04:58.629> up<00:04:58.659> here<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.580> think<00:05:00.580> we're<00:05:00.729> not<00:05:00.819> done

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:01.059 
right up here I think we're not done

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.510 
right up here I think we're not done
with<00:05:01.180> our<00:05:01.330> mountains<00:05:01.809> yet<00:05:02.279> let's<00:05:03.279> throw<00:05:03.490> one

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
with our mountains yet let's throw one

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.939 
with our mountains yet let's throw one
more<00:05:03.999> in<00:05:04.229> it'll<00:05:05.229> sort<00:05:05.439> of<00:05:05.589> help<00:05:05.740> pushing

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
more in it'll sort of help pushing

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.730 
more in it'll sort of help pushing
everything<00:05:06.339> back<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.259> really<00:05:08.469> enjoy

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
everything back and I just really enjoy

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.589 
everything back and I just really enjoy
painting<00:05:09.009> these<00:05:09.339> mountains<00:05:12.119> there<00:05:13.119> this

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
painting these mountains there this

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.879 
painting these mountains there this
one's<00:05:13.809> nice<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.080> dark<00:05:16.229> because<00:05:17.229> it's<00:05:17.409> just<00:05:17.770> a

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
one's nice and dark because it's just a

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.639 
one's nice and dark because it's just a
little<00:05:18.249> bit<00:05:18.399> closer<00:05:18.729> than<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:19.659> one

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:22.649 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:25.379 

you<00:05:23.649> know<00:05:23.740> how<00:05:23.860> we<00:05:23.919> can<00:05:24.189> begin<00:05:24.490> adding<00:05:24.969> in<00:05:25.360> some

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
you know how we can begin adding in some

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.980
