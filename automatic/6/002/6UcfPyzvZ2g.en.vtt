is<00:02:23.640> AK<00:02:23.820> Morris<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.990> here's<00:02:25.170> an<00:02:25.290> example<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
is AK Morris so here's an example of the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.449 
is AK Morris so here's an example of the
healing<00:02:26.250> thing<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.770> sanity<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> guess

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
healing thing so just sanity and I guess

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.940 
healing thing so just sanity and I guess
if<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.700> walk<00:02:29.880> too<00:02:30.060> far<00:02:30.239> away

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
if I walk too far away

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.130 
if I walk too far away
something<00:02:32.580> nice<00:02:32.760> about<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.900> special

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
something nice about it is the special

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.070 
something nice about it is the special
attack<00:02:34.530> which<00:02:34.950> I'll<00:02:35.100> do<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.930> cuz<00:02:36.930> apparently

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
attack which I'll do now cuz apparently

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.290 
attack which I'll do now cuz apparently
oh<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.500> think<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:37.980> didn't<00:02:38.340> mind<00:02:38.490> yours<00:02:38.970> okay

oh I think I just didn't mind yours okay
yeah<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.620> fast<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.580> go

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
yeah I think it really fast there you go

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.130 
yeah I think it really fast there you go
and<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.060> another<00:02:42.240> nice<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.480> bonus<00:02:42.840> is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and that's another nice little bonus is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.560 
and that's another nice little bonus is
a<00:02:43.170> slow<00:02:43.440> motion<00:02:43.920> I'm<00:02:44.580> sure<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.090> tell<00:02:45.270> it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
a slow motion I'm sure you can tell it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.600 
a slow motion I'm sure you can tell it's
pretty<00:02:46.080> simple<00:02:46.680> as<00:02:46.800> far<00:02:47.010> as<00:02:47.130> gameplay<00:02:47.370> goes

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
pretty simple as far as gameplay goes

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
pretty simple as far as gameplay goes
there's<00:02:48.090> not<00:02:48.270> much<00:02:49.850> not<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.600> have

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
there's not much not much to it you have

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.320 
there's not much not much to it you have
your<00:02:51.960> gun<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.220> melee<00:02:53.580> hope<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
your gun you have your melee hope it you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.310 
your gun you have your melee hope it you
have<00:02:55.290> your<00:02:55.440> few<00:02:55.680> different<00:02:55.920> types<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.280> enemies

which<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.780> good<00:03:00.990> i<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.670> nice

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
which is good i think that it's a nice

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.040 
which is good i think that it's a nice
break<00:03:03.180> from<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:05.180> extensive<00:03:06.180> games<00:03:06.570> i<00:03:06.810> kind<00:03:07.020> of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
break from the extensive games i kind of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.420 
break from the extensive games i kind of
like<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> shut<00:03:07.560> off<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.860> play<00:03:08.040> game<00:03:08.280> like

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
like the shut off the play game like

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.100 
like the shut off the play game like
this<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.640> every<00:03:08.790> once<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.120> while<00:03:09.150> and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
this is every once in a while and

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.940 
this is every once in a while and
especially<00:03:10.350> when<00:03:10.560> you're<00:03:10.650> playing<00:03:10.830> with

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
especially when you're playing with

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.500 
especially when you're playing with
somebody<00:03:11.100> else<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.790> much<00:03:11.910> alone<00:03:12.180> but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
somebody else it's not so much alone but

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.870 
somebody else it's not so much alone but

it<00:03:18.690> does<00:03:18.930> does<00:03:19.590> kind<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.540> what<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.750> just

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
it does does kind of what this is just

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.470 
it does does kind of what this is just
so<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.740> lock<00:03:22.920> special<00:03:23.460> things<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.060> space

rain I think by being the first mission

kajigger
yeah<00:04:55.919> yeah<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:57.100> think<00:04:57.280> it's<00:04:57.430> too<00:04:57.520> rigid<00:04:57.610> up<00:04:57.820> so

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
yeah yeah I think it's too rigid up so

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.820 
yeah yeah I think it's too rigid up so
like<00:04:58.210> yeah<00:04:58.630> I'm<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.050> be<00:04:59.169> heavy<00:04:59.350> characters

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
like yeah I'm you be heavy characters

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.469 
like yeah I'm you be heavy characters
and<00:05:00.070> then<00:05:00.160> we<00:05:00.250> research<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.700> ranged

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
and then we research the ranged

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.180 
and then we research the ranged
characters<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:01.960> time<00:05:02.229> we're<00:05:02.470> not<00:05:02.500> penalized

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
characters this time we're not penalized

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.219 
characters this time we're not penalized
just<00:05:03.640> because<00:05:03.970> we<00:05:04.450> wanted<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.780> swing<00:05:04.960> out

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
just because we wanted to swing out

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.780 
just because we wanted to swing out
yeah<00:05:05.740> that<00:05:05.919> makes<00:05:06.070> sense<00:05:06.160> I<00:05:06.460> do<00:05:06.520> like<00:05:06.760> that

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
yeah that makes sense I do like that

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.940 
yeah that makes sense I do like that
actually<00:05:07.330> it's<00:05:07.479> kind<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.720> nice<00:05:07.870> on<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.770> side

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
actually it's kind of nice on the side

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.559 
actually it's kind of nice on the side
of<00:05:09.070> bonuses<00:05:09.610> there's<00:05:09.910> not<00:05:10.060> really<00:05:10.240> that

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
of bonuses there's not really that

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.749 
of bonuses there's not really that
it's<00:05:11.259> kind<00:05:11.559> of<00:05:11.589> like<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.830> same<00:05:11.979> thing<00:05:12.039> just<00:05:12.639> a

one plus five the second one's plus ten

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.169 
one plus five the second one's plus ten
but<00:05:25.919> again<00:05:26.919> it's<00:05:27.189> like<00:05:27.249> a<00:05:27.339> ten<00:05:27.639> dollar<00:05:27.789> games

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:28.179

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.820 
but again it's like a ten dollar games
which<00:05:28.419> is<00:05:28.569> really<00:05:28.869> hard<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.110> be<00:05:29.259> harsh<00:05:29.439> on<00:05:29.649> it

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
which is really hard to be harsh on it

which is really hard to be harsh on it
it's<00:05:30.159> one<00:05:30.339> of<00:05:30.459> the<00:05:30.520> very<00:05:30.669> few<00:05:30.849> games<00:05:31.209> that's

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069

isn't<00:06:43.189> necessarily<00:06:43.610> gonna<00:06:43.789> be<00:06:43.969> something

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
it's pretty decent I think it's worth

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.339 
it's pretty decent I think it's worth
$10<00:06:48.919> Zak<00:06:49.520> go<00:06:49.879> more<00:06:50.330> or<00:06:50.419> less<00:06:50.539> than<00:06:50.779> dollars<00:06:51.169> all
