one<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.420> cool<00:02:10.630> features<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.350> how<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
one of the cool features is how the

one of the cool features is how the
windows<00:02:12.010> operate<00:02:12.520> their<00:02:12.730> totally<00:02:13.210> silent

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
windows operate their totally silent

they<00:02:14.320> slide<00:02:14.680> up<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.040> down<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> pull<00:02:15.940> cord

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
they slide up and down with a pull cord

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.200 
they slide up and down with a pull cord
with<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> magnet<00:02:17.770> okay<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.850> was<00:02:19.000> me<00:02:19.180> just

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
with a magnet okay that was me just

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.160 
with a magnet okay that was me just
clicking<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.050> didn't<00:02:20.440> need<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:25.170> that's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
clicking it on didn't need to be that's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.620 
clicking it on didn't need to be that's
pretty<00:02:26.530> slick<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.850> can<00:02:28.030> either<00:02:28.240> take<00:02:28.450> them

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
pretty slick you can either take them

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.800 
pretty slick you can either take them
off<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.590> pull<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.860> window<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:34.000> also<00:02:34.420> inside

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
off and pull the window and also inside

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.750 
off and pull the window and also inside
each<00:02:35.080> win<00:02:35.350> do<00:02:35.500> they<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> drain<00:02:36.160> hole<00:02:36.190> plug

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
each win do they have a drain hole plug

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
each win do they have a drain hole plug
which<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> great<00:02:37.600> idea<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.050> if<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.590> snow

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
which is a great idea so if you get snow

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.580 
which is a great idea so if you get snow
or<00:02:39.459> rain<00:02:39.490> or<00:02:39.790> anything<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.530> a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
or rain or anything you don't get a

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.050 
or rain or anything you don't get a
bunch<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.980> wood<00:02:42.160> or<00:02:42.280> buildup<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.880> then<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
bunch of wood or buildup and then you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.180 
bunch of wood or buildup and then you
have<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.630> obviously<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.380> water<00:02:44.680> leakage

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
have you know obviously a water leakage

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.020 
have you know obviously a water leakage
