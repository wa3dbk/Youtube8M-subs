hi<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:06.359> Brian<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.870> my<00:00:06.990> online<00:00:07.140> guitar<00:00:07.440> com

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
hi it's Brian for my online guitar com

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.580 
hi it's Brian for my online guitar com
in<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:09.240> lesson<00:00:09.510> we're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> cover<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
in this lesson we're going to cover the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.509 
in this lesson we're going to cover the
second<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.219> five<00:00:11.519> pentatonic<00:00:12.330> patterns<00:00:13.519> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
second of five pentatonic patterns this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.430 
second of five pentatonic patterns this
put<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.179> pattern<00:00:15.509> picks<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:16.139> were

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
put this this pattern picks up were

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.620 
put this this pattern picks up were
pattern<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.250> left<00:00:17.550> off<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.449> hopefully

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
pattern one left off so hopefully

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
pattern one left off so hopefully
hopefully<00:00:19.140> you've<00:00:19.439> seen<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:20.010> lesson

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hopefully you've seen the first lesson

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
hopefully you've seen the first lesson
you've<00:00:20.670> studied<00:00:20.910> pattern<00:00:21.420> one<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.930> you've

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you've studied pattern one and you've

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.730 
you've studied pattern one and you've
memorized<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.600> let<00:00:24.600> me<00:00:24.689> zoom<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.320> hands

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
memorized it let me zoom up on my hands

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
memorized it let me zoom up on my hands
so<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> look<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.359> this

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so you can take a look and see what this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
so you can take a look and see what this
pattern<00:00:27.930> does<00:00:30.230> okay<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.289> last<00:00:32.130> time<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.640> with

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
pattern does okay so last time in with

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
pattern does okay so last time in with
pattern<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.690> practice<00:00:34.050> playing<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
pattern one we practice playing this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
pattern one we practice playing this
scale<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.670> key<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.149> minor<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.630> future

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
scale and the key of a minor in future

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.790 
scale and the key of a minor in future
lessons<00:00:37.050> we're<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.680> these

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
lessons we're going to take these

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
lessons we're going to take these
patterns<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> move<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> other<00:00:38.940> keys<00:00:39.270> but

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
patterns and move them to other keys but

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.479 
patterns and move them to other keys but
until<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> patterns

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
until we get through all the patterns

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.270 
until we get through all the patterns
will<00:00:41.640> stick<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.180> minor<00:00:42.739> now<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.070> means

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
will stick with a minor now that means

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
will stick with a minor now that means
and<00:00:44.879> I'll<00:00:44.969> explain<00:00:45.210> how<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> change<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> other

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and I'll explain how to change the other

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
and I'll explain how to change the other
keys<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.890> where<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> root<00:00:47.309> notes<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> lot

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
keys to where the root notes and a lot

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
keys to where the root notes and a lot
and<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> stuff<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.160> we're<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and all that stuff so we're going to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
and all that stuff so we're going to
start<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:51.350> County<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.559> left<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.949> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
start here County where we left off on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
start here County where we left off on
pattern<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.570> remember<00:00:54.899> pattern<00:00:55.230> one

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
pattern one if you remember pattern one

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.860 
pattern one if you remember pattern one
started<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> first<00:00:56.219> finger<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.510> 5th

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
started with the first finger on the 5th

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010 
started with the first finger on the 5th
fret<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.739> 5th<00:00:58.949> fret<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.390> second<00:01:00.870> node

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
fret the 5th fret here the second node

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.830 
fret the 5th fret here the second node
of<00:01:01.170> pattern<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> pinkie<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.690> 8th

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
of pattern one was the pinkie on the 8th

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
of pattern one was the pinkie on the 8th
fret<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.000> pattern<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> covered

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
fret so that pattern kind of covered

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
fret so that pattern kind of covered
this<00:01:07.080> whole<00:01:07.350> area<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> fretboard<00:01:08.750> what

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
this whole area of the fretboard what

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
this whole area of the fretboard what
we're<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.260> pattern<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we're going to do with pattern to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
we're going to do with pattern to
discover<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> next<00:01:12.090> section<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> front

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
discover the next section of the front

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380 
discover the next section of the front
board<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.360> first

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
board up here so to do that the first

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.870 
board up here so to do that the first
note<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> scale<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> no

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
note of the scale is going to be this no

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
note of the scale is going to be this no
right<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.200> instead<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.530> playing<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
right here but instead of playing it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
right here but instead of playing it
with<00:01:20.040> my<00:01:20.189> pinky<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> 8th<00:01:21.000> fret<00:01:21.390> 6th

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with my pinky here on the 8th fret 6th

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
with my pinky here on the 8th fret 6th
string<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> start<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.820> my

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
string I'm going to start out with my

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.109 
string I'm going to start out with my
second<00:01:24.450> finger<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:27.590> now<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> pattern

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
second finger like this now the pattern

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.960 
second finger like this now the pattern
one<00:01:30.270> also<00:01:30.570> had<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:31.200> notes<00:01:31.409> per<00:01:31.680> string<00:01:31.970> this

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
one also had two notes per string this

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
one also had two notes per string this
is<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> case<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.200> case<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.740> all

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
is also the case with this case with all

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.499 
is also the case with this case with all
the<00:01:34.979> patterns<00:01:35.310> actually<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.090> keep<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the patterns actually but keep that in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.819 
the patterns actually but keep that in
mind<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> simplifies<00:01:37.439> things<00:01:37.470> when

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
mind it kind of simplifies things when

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249 
mind it kind of simplifies things when
you're<00:01:37.920> trying<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> memorize<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> we'll

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you're trying to memorize it so we'll

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.600 
you're trying to memorize it so we'll
start<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> first<00:01:40.799> note<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.310> string

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
