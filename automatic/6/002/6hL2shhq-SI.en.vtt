00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
easy it's going to cut it's not as thick

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.240 
easy it's going to cut it's not as thick
as<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> little

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.910 
and by using the ruler and the exacto
knife<00:03:12.400> I'm<00:03:12.760> getting<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:14.110> very<00:03:14.230> straight
