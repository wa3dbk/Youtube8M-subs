that<00:02:46.910> it's<00:02:47.910> funny<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.600> made<00:02:48.750> a

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
that it's funny because I just made a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.630 
that it's funny because I just made a
video<00:02:48.930> about<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> couple<00:02:49.590> months<00:02:49.920> ago<00:02:50.100> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
video about this a couple months ago and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.500 
video about this a couple months ago and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I figured that I would be standing I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.449 
I figured that I would be standing I
would<00:02:54.780> visualize<00:02:55.290> myself<00:02:55.709> standing<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
would visualize myself standing in a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.080 
would visualize myself standing in a
stadium<00:02:57.260> talking<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> crowd<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.910> you<00:02:59.940> know

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.070 
that way so you can grow that way you
know<00:05:22.229> but<00:05:22.770> if<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:23.039> put<00:05:23.219> that<00:05:23.340> down<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.080> that's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
know but if you put that down and that's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.270 
know but if you put that down and that's
why<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.349> not<00:05:25.469> a<00:05:25.500> matter<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.800> money<00:05:26.099> being

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
why it's not a matter of money being

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.740 
why it's not a matter of money being
right<00:05:26.520> or<00:05:26.639> wrong<00:05:26.789> but<00:05:27.300> if<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:27.479> put<00:05:27.629> it<00:05:27.719> down

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
right or wrong but if you put it down

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.899 
right or wrong but if you put it down
and<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.169> like<00:05:28.199> that's<00:05:28.409> not<00:05:28.530> what<00:05:28.830> your<00:05:29.039> your

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
and it's like that's not what your your

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.730 
and it's like that's not what your your
soul<00:05:30.210> needs<00:05:30.599> for<00:05:30.960> its<00:05:31.020> development<00:05:31.560> right<00:05:31.710> now

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
soul needs for its development right now

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.089 
soul needs for its development right now
then<00:05:32.729> you're<00:05:32.849> just<00:05:33.000> not<00:05:33.090> going<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.360> have<00:05:33.599> that

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
then you're just not going to have that

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.830 
then you're just not going to have that
so<00:05:35.099> getting<00:05:35.729> in<00:05:35.879> touch<00:05:36.000> with<00:05:36.060> your<00:05:36.300> why<00:05:36.539> goes

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
so getting in touch with your why goes

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.189 
so getting in touch with your why goes
far<00:05:37.110> more<00:05:37.409> than<00:05:38.370> even<00:05:38.969> what<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.780> consider

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
far more than even what you consider

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.659 
far more than even what you consider
what<00:05:40.379> you<00:05:40.469> have<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.680> really<00:05:40.860> ask<00:05:40.889> yourself<00:05:41.490> is

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
what you have to really ask yourself is

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.869 
what you have to really ask yourself is
that<00:05:41.939> why<00:05:42.150> should<00:05:42.680> should<00:05:43.680> be<00:05:43.879> centered

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
that why should should be centered

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:48.709 
that why should should be centered
around<00:05:46.190> how<00:05:47.190> can<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.759> do<00:05:47.969> have<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.569> become

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
around how can you do have you become

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.209 
around how can you do have you become
the<00:05:48.900> strongest<00:05:49.229> version<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.680> yourself<00:05:49.800> and
