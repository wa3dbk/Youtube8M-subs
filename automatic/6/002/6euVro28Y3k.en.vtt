00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
parts it's a weight of fifteen point six

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.890 
parts it's a weight of fifteen point six
kilos<00:00:39.550> it's<00:00:39.790> really<00:00:40.059> nice<00:00:40.239> in<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.600> air<00:00:40.750> as

kilos it's really nice in the air as
well<00:00:41.050> but<00:00:41.769> it's<00:00:42.159> still<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:42.670> strong<00:00:43.059> and

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
well but it's still really strong and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.180 
well but it's still really strong and
you<00:00:43.299> can<00:00:43.360> survive<00:00:43.809> nearly<00:00:44.260> every<00:00:44.710> impact<00:00:44.979> with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
you can survive nearly every impact with

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.039 
you can survive nearly every impact with
it<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:45.640> one<00:00:45.879> of<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.150> most<00:00:46.360> important<00:00:46.839> things

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
it so one of the most important things

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.829 
it so one of the most important things
riding<00:00:47.920> big<00:00:48.100> bikes<00:00:48.339> on<00:00:48.670> big<00:00:48.879> jumps<00:00:49.299> like<00:00:49.659> we

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
riding big bikes on big jumps like we

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.020 
riding big bikes on big jumps like we
have<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.110> year<00:00:50.379> that<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.070> course<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.610> a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
have this year that the course is a

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.780 
have this year that the course is a
really<00:00:52.479> progressive<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.470> hard<00:00:53.860> set<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.640> set

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
really progressive and hard set it set

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.079 
really progressive and hard set it set
up<00:00:54.970> that's<00:00:55.540> why<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.720> use<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.989> air<00:00:56.500> system<00:00:57.159> because

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
up that's why I use a air system because

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.899 
up that's why I use a air system because
it<00:00:58.210> can<00:00:58.330> pump<00:00:58.479> it<00:00:58.659> up<00:00:58.780> pretty<00:00:59.019> hard<00:00:59.260> and

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
it can pump it up pretty hard and

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.549 
it can pump it up pretty hard and
especially<00:01:00.909> when<00:01:01.330> you're<00:01:01.479> hitting<00:01:01.720> big<00:01:02.260> lips

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
especially when you're hitting big lips

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.910 
especially when you're hitting big lips
like<00:01:03.159> our<00:01:03.400> big<00:01:03.640> Fiat<00:01:04.059> hip<00:01:04.210> jump<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:05.170> need<00:01:05.350> lots

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
like our big Fiat hip jump you need lots

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160 
like our big Fiat hip jump you need lots
of<00:01:06.130> travel<00:01:06.939> when<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.270> land<00:01:07.540> because<00:01:08.020> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
of travel when you land because the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.320 
of travel when you land because the
impacts<00:01:08.530> are<00:01:08.619> really<00:01:08.860> really<00:01:09.460> hard<00:01:09.670> sometimes

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
impacts are really really hard sometimes

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.990 
impacts are really really hard sometimes
and<00:01:10.810> also<00:01:11.350> pulling<00:01:11.950> back<00:01:12.220> flips<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.760> bike

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
and also pulling back flips on this bike

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.020 
and also pulling back flips on this bike
is<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.869> fact<00:01:14.289> where<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.619> need<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:15.039> hard<00:01:15.640> set<00:01:15.880> up

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
is a fact where you need a hard set up

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.849 
is a fact where you need a hard set up
because<00:01:16.329> it's<00:01:16.780> really<00:01:16.929> disturbing<00:01:17.469> when<00:01:17.710> it's

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
because it's really disturbing when it's

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:37.450 
because it's really disturbing when it's
too<00:01:18.009> soft

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.800 

so<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.580> direction<00:01:38.850> mountain<00:01:39.360> biking<00:01:39.690> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so the direction mountain biking is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
so the direction mountain biking is
moving<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.470> guess<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> big

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
moving I guess is more and more the big

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990 
moving I guess is more and more the big
bike<00:01:42.390> style<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.290> doing<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:44.070> big<00:01:44.310> jumps<00:01:44.760> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bike style and doing like big jumps on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
bike style and doing like big jumps on
the<00:01:45.480> downhill<00:01:45.810> bike<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> maybe<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.890> some

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the downhill bike and maybe put some

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
the downhill bike and maybe put some
tricks<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:51.770> for<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.370> most<00:01:53.610> amazing

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
tricks in there for me the most amazing

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
tricks in there for me the most amazing
feelings<00:01:54.870> during<00:01:55.350> riding<00:01:55.800> my<00:01:55.920> bike<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.750> really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
feelings during riding my bike is really

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.730 
feelings during riding my bike is really
stomping<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:59.070> tricks<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.820> getting<00:02:00.330> an<00:02:00.740> air

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
stomping some tricks or getting an air

stomping some tricks or getting an air
Dan<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.550> feeling<00:02:02.910> when<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.240> taking

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
off and for example this year when I did

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
off and for example this year when I did
the<00:02:06.180> hip<00:02:06.330> flip<00:02:06.570> over<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.200> Fiat<00:02:07.500> hip<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.399> your

place<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.210> having<00:02:59.450> good<00:02:59.690> times

place and we are all having good times
and<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.670> think<00:03:01.730> one<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.330> best<00:03:02.540> for

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and this is I think one of the best for

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.300 
and this is I think one of the best for
example<00:03:03.290> you're<00:03:03.380> riding<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.770> train<00:03:04.010> through

example you're riding a train through

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.890 
example you're riding a train through
the<00:03:04.370> whole<00:03:04.580> course<00:03:04.820> with<00:03:05.330> five<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.780> your

the whole course with five of your
friends<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.830> end<00:03:06.980> you're<00:03:07.220> staying

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
friends and in the end you're staying

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.570 
friends and in the end you're staying
there<00:03:08.300> clapping<00:03:08.930> their<00:03:09.050> hands<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.580> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.740 
getting crazy with it and yeah
you're<00:03:12.950> also<00:03:13.190> alone<00:03:13.610> because<00:03:14.000> when<00:03:14.540> you're

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
you're also alone because when you're

riding you've nothing around you you're

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.200 
riding you've nothing around you you're
just<00:03:16.940> focusing<00:03:17.510> focusing<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:19.280> every<00:03:19.910> jump

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
just focusing focusing on on every jump

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.690 
just focusing focusing on on every jump
on<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.960> dial<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.380> get<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.550> have

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
on this dial you get in it and you have

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.870 
on this dial you get in it and you have
to<00:03:22.760> really<00:03:23.030> go<00:03:23.840> push<00:03:24.440> hard<00:03:24.710> for<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.370> yeah<00:03:25.820> I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
to really go push hard for it and yeah I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.400 
to really go push hard for it and yeah I
think<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.020> biggest

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
think it's the it's the biggest

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.730 
think it's the it's the biggest
satisfaction<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.370> imagine<00:03:28.580> after<00:03:29.740> four

satisfaction you can imagine after four

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.940 
satisfaction you can imagine after four
weeks<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.100> building<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.209> maybe<00:03:32.840> had<00:03:33.140> four
