particular for today just because I
don't<00:01:46.850> want<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.150> be<00:01:47.240> repetitive<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.930> I've

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't want to be repetitive and I've

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
don't want to be repetitive and I've
done<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.680> I've<00:01:49.159> done<00:01:49.430> thousands<00:01:49.970> now<00:01:50.210> I

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
done you know I've done thousands now I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.730 
done you know I've done thousands now I
could<00:01:50.600> say<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.750> now<00:01:51.080> because<00:01:51.320> it's<00:01:51.470> over<00:01:51.680> a

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
could say that now because it's over a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.060 
could say that now because it's over a
thousand<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:53.420> know<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.110> really<00:01:54.979> don't

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
thousand and you know so I really don't

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.469 
thousand and you know so I really don't
have<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> lot<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.520> talk<00:01:55.759> about<00:01:55.820> i<00:01:56.000> just<00:01:56.299> i<00:01:56.450> just

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
have a lot to talk about i just i just

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.749 
have a lot to talk about i just i just
don't<00:01:56.840> have<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.020> lot<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:58.040> say<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.700> time

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
don't have a lot to to say at this time

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.300 
don't have a lot to to say at this time
so<00:01:59.330> figure<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.810> would<00:01:59.869> be<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.049> good<00:02:00.229> time<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:00.740> do

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
so figure it would be a good time to do

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.340 
so figure it would be a good time to do
a<00:02:01.340> channel<00:02:01.759> updates<00:02:02.030> video<00:02:02.330> one<00:02:02.780> video<00:02:03.049> i<00:02:03.140> can

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
a channel updates video one video i can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.420
