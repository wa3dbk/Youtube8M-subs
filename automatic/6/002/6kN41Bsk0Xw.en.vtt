00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey you love i have an e today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.429
 get a mail request from a jewel 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.790
 what would like to change his diet 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.299
 the full-bodied carbohydrate too 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.060
 if even a vegetable diet 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.000
 and she asked me so what can 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.439
 I do that when I have such difficulties 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 I have to switch from the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.810
 animal products to the new diet 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.410
 now as easy as can on the new 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 I wean myself from animal products 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.440
 and I had to get out of my own 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 experience was for me that was 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.489
 actually relatively easy and others 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 people find it most relatively 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 easy so once you're in it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 you just find so many new things 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.660
 someone can eat you can try new ones 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 Recipes from man is much more fruit man 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 Rather, strength is much more important 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 Oatmeal because he has something in it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.050
 direction and these are all things that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
 from the house itself in itself great 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 people like to get up 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.470
 carbohydrates 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.299
 yes and that is really an advantage because you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 you just taken without the things 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.010
 for the didier also taste or 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 At least you should be you only yes 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.799
 because there are 10 bananas there then 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 you should not necessarily 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 imitate 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.530
 besides, it tastes so it is 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.950
 not as difficult as it is from the outside 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.600
 or before I can look anyway 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.970
 just give the tip try each one 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.880
 meal individually 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 that means you take the breakfast 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
 and say okay the rest of the day 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 I just leave it as I am 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.009
 always nourished've even or perhaps construction 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.120
 having a bit more healthy products with you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.280
 a little bit more 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.180
 no but basically, I leave that alone 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 the way it is 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.930
 so that does not burden me so much 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.400
 to do it all at once and that's how it was 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.780
 are just different types of 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.830
 People say the ones of today 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.240
 radical from today to tomorrow radically 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.740
 finish the no more products 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.160
 others do that for a couple of weeks 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.620
 weeks a few months and then have 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.810
 just the final result just stop 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.460
 maybe less stressful for her 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.370
 Whatever your life circumstances 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.140
 So you take breakfast and then 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.960
 you are looking for many recipes 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.450
 to try out things out of place 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.070
 what you like you fix what in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.200
 maybe you fit your everyday life 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.710
 somehow can prepare already evening 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.230
 save some time is what easy for 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 you will work then yes 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 breakfast on due and you have several 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 possibilities several variations you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.280
 you perhaps somewhere on 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 write so you do not forget them 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.630
 because yes, most people are just eating 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 very shy to work out who 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.400
 Restricted may have theirs 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.489
 56 dishes she always keeps somehow 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.930
 after all, take turns and 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.170
 do not really come from this 56th 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.489
 dishes away and yes that's what they see 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.320
 Do not hold the rest of it, that's why 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.390
 important just when you put around that you 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.340
 Write the whole thing on what you like 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.340
 is that working well and so what 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.110
 if you have the breakfast order 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.750
 and tomorrow you breakfast every futters 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.190
 dream someday the feeling that is 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.350
 not exhausting so that is 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.470
 somehow it fits so well in mine 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.800
 everyday and fully to me and tasted 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.300
 and that is already fully everyday for 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.930
 want to become normal for me 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.450
 won 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 then you can lunch one answer it 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 then you also turn that lunch over 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.610
 shortly thereafter what recipes what 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.410
 I can never possibly do what I can 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.239
 prepare to take to school with 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.250
 to work always take at home 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.920
 It's also important to prepare 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.890
 the a and o people have shopped 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.170
 at some point full selection 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.870
 home have yes that's really important because 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.880
 otherwise you are relatively fast in the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.250
 area was then too little and yes 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:04.810
 we do not want that we have then 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:08.590
 problems with jak ratings so solved 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.349
 on animal products and we want that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.330
 avoid and because we are enough 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.160
 We do not have food then 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.070
 really needs further food after that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.829
 Power is then of my salary the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.510
 products yes so if that lunch 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.020
 then put together or one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.210
 favorite recipe one since they all 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.840
 Somehow, what worked was flopping 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.639
 then you make yourself as dinner 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.350
 So system should be clear so easy 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.650
 step by step 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.660
 and if you somehow have a day 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.280
 you also have to shit it has to be everything 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.389
 I had to go fast and I had to 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.060
 get me something and I had 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:51.430
 somehow no right option 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.110
 I have yet again on animals and the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.590
 Next time you learn the best out 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.000
 Of course, better prepared and 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.169
 maybe other options or something 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.700
 locate another restaurant or 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.990
 The waiters but ask if he 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.760
 maybe something else can do 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.450
 what is not on the card is easy 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.640
 only potatoes into the no hofmeister 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.590
 cooks or so to represent the senate 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.140
 without the chicken stripes anyway 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.729
 schafskÃ¤se 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.020
 So best you just learn out there 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.880
 and then that's not a problem 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.979
 we are all not perfect and 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.919
 we are not perfect from the beginning 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.750
 made and yes that comes just with the 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.780
 lines with the numbers like that of course 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.620
 and yes that's my opinion 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.840
 relative 1 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.970
 connects over a long period of time 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.370
 that's just going to be so easy for you 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.240
 that I'm not working anymore and 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:50.080
 that you just did it 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.570
 It can be yes and only when you say it 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.940
 Breakfast so I know I'm fully out 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.040
 I became full of the problem, yes only 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.100
 then you go to the next meal and 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.610
 vitamin c is the joh hope that has 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.970
 something brought and we'll see each other 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.970
 next time
