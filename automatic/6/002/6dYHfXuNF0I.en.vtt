hit shift R so select the sidewalk and
over<00:01:48.300> over<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.690> road<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:48.900> hit<00:01:49.200> shift<00:01:49.440> R<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
over over the road and hit shift R so it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.390 
over over the road and hit shift R so it
may<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:51.990> move<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.650> be<00:01:52.860> sure<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.190> at<00:01:53.310> the

and it says the raycast didn't hit make

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
and it says the raycast didn't hit make
sure<00:01:58.650> your<00:01:58.830> objects<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> align<00:01:59.700> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
sure your objects you want to align to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.810 
sure your objects you want to align to
has<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.720> Collider<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.979> make<00:02:02.160> sure<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.400> objects

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
has a Collider so make sure the objects

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.590 
has a Collider so make sure the objects
here<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> road<00:02:04.520> simply<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.790> need<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.970> Collider

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
here the road simply you need a Collider

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.170 
here the road simply you need a Collider
here<00:02:06.870> so<00:02:07.050> components<00:02:09.560> physics<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:12.000> mesh

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
here so components physics do mesh

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.880 
here so components physics do mesh
Collider<00:02:13.370> now<00:02:14.370> let's<00:02:14.489> try<00:02:14.670> again<00:02:15.709> it's<00:02:16.709> like

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
handle and now let's just finish up this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.509 
handle and now let's just finish up this
side<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.680> we'll<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.280> other

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
side so we'll just like the other

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.150 
side so we'll just like the other
sidewalk<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.090> well<00:03:00.530> ctrl<00:03:01.530> D<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.739> duplicate

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
hold the control drag on the y axis
handle<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.459> now<00:03:08.610> let's<00:03:08.940> finish<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.450> other

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
handle so now let's finish the other

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.100 
handle so now let's finish the other
side

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
side

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.460 
side
let's<00:03:10.800> grab<00:03:11.190> sidewalk<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.150> long<00:03:12.360> C<00:03:12.630> drag<00:03:13.319> that

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
let's grab sidewalk one long C drag that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.370 
let's grab sidewalk one long C drag that
one<00:03:13.590> in

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
one in

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.870 
one in
I'll<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.530> rotate<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.280> position<00:03:17.430> real

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
I'll just rotate that in position real

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.360 
I'll just rotate that in position real
quick<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:19.860> side<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.190> off<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
quick and now for this side will off the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.190 
quick and now for this side will off the
vertex<00:03:20.790> snap<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.630> we'll<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.990> close<00:03:24.200> old

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
vertex snap it so we'll get in close old

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.260 
vertex snap it so we'll get in close old
V<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.280> notice<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> axis<00:03:27.030> handle

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
V and you notice the axis handle

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.150 
V and you notice the axis handle
immediately<00:03:27.900> goes<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> vertex<00:03:28.680> there<00:03:28.950> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
immediately goes to the vertex there and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.010 
immediately goes to the vertex there and
just<00:03:29.280> click<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.880> drag<00:03:29.970> while<00:03:30.390> holding<00:03:30.450> it

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
just click and drag while holding it

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.010 
just click and drag while holding it
to<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.890> end<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> sidewalk<00:03:32.490> or<00:03:33.030> Road<00:03:33.330> and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
to that end of the sidewalk or Road and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.970 
to that end of the sidewalk or Road and
now<00:03:37.020> I'll<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.350> duplicate<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.380> let's<00:03:40.680> grab

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
now I'll just duplicate and let's grab

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.070 
now I'll just duplicate and let's grab
these<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:42.350> duplicate<00:03:43.350> drag<00:03:43.920> over<00:03:44.930> rotate<00:03:45.930> in

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
these to duplicate drag over rotate in

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.700 
these to duplicate drag over rotate in
position<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.260> we're<00:03:49.890> all<00:03:49.950> set<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.590> can

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
position and we're all set so you can

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.290 
position and we're all set so you can
see<00:03:52.830> how<00:03:52.890> easy<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.370> once<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> have<00:03:54.150> your

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
see how easy it is once you have your

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.880 
see how easy it is once you have your
snap<00:03:54.600> settings<00:03:54.990> just<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.230> get<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> really<00:03:55.680> quick

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
snap settings just to get a really quick

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.360 
snap settings just to get a really quick
road<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.460> sidewalk<00:03:57.080> setup<00:03:58.080> them<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
road and sidewalk setup them with the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.510 
road and sidewalk setup them with the
included<00:04:00.050> editor<00:04:01.050> scripts<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.830> allow<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.040> to

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
included editor scripts to allow you to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.340 
included editor scripts to allow you to
teleport<00:04:03.000> another<00:04:03.360> line<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.050> could<00:04:04.170> do<00:04:04.230> this

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
teleport another line you could do this

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.490 
teleport another line you could do this
really<00:04:04.500> fast<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.060> part<00:04:06.270> 2<00:04:06.480> we'll<00:04:07.080> play<00:04:07.410> some

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
really fast so in part 2 we'll play some

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.010 
really fast so in part 2 we'll play some
buildings
