00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 the first module of the possible map them 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.089
 asks that they define the social problem that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 you want to solve 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.469
 please do not assume that we see or 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049
 we understand the social problem in the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.450
 same way that you for that is very 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.390
 important that they tell us clearly which 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.600
 is the problem because it exists and how 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.699
 great is impossible we are looking for 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 innovative solutions to problems in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.130
 many areas from the environment and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.400
 the use of natural resources health 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 food education 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.350
 housing and many more all these areas 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.450
 they have problems that we need 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.559
 solve and that exist for different 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.860
 reasons for example may be missing 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.140
 excess some resources may be missing 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.030
 information or lack of competence what 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.079
 which can take very high accesses to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.480
 the beneficiaries that we are interested in 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.609
 was the one that over capacity because of lack of 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.979
 resources that lack of transparency 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.820
 because there is that problem that you 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.590
 they are interested in solving 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.019
 explain things that are so great about this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.390
 problem when they're talking about that 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.920
 trust for example how many people 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 they are affected 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.430
 as in where and with what consequences and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.110
 when they think of the consequences 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.149
 only the consequences or the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 short - term costs is also 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.670
 medium and long term who is paying 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.299
 for example for the problems that 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.880
 exist in Mexico is the lack of access 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.859
 to resources among people who have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.929
 ideas of very parent projects that can 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.869
 generate value and people who can 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.810
 finance those projects in response 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.689
 to this problem came anchor that is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.009
 the first crowdfunding platform in 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.959
 Mexico 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.539
 this is a platform that basically 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.310
 what it does is connect people who 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.520
 have those project cities that are 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.929
 the anchors with the creators with the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.500
 people who can finance these 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.050
 projects that are the dining rooms 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 in this part we have to demonstrate 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.640
 who understand the problem very well 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.940
 when you have to convince that it's something 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 that we can not really then
