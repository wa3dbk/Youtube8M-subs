 last four years of education 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870

 IDEB best indices Index 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.160
 development of basic education and we 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.670
 Let's see now what it was that the team 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.789
 we were in two schools very 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.769
 different from one another and we saw 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.219
 and year-round can not be a battle 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.040
 only from student to family to school 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.000
 teacher are very important and make 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.770
 difference 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.450
 see the report we made with the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.450
 rbs tv support 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.160
 We left Brasilia toward the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.500
 navigators 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.520
 we arrived at our first little destination 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.800
 after 11 a.m. before the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.770
 dawn we take the road to sÃ£o 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.030
 bento of the south two hours of travel 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.730
 br 101 are bento do sul has 74 thousand 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.220
 inhabitants and they can be proud of 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.590
 performance of students in the final years of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.500
 elementary school 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 ideb registered here is the highest of the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.690
 state 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.960
 the indicator has been increasing since 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.479
 school and reached 6.2 among the students 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.850
 of the final years of elementary school 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.850
 on a scale of up to 9 the school 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.770
 level 7 in portuguese in brazil 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.500
 this indicates that students are able to 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.900
 to deepen in narrative texts and to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.390
 information in different ways in 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.530
 mathematics on a scale of up to 12 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 was 7 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.670
 here the students have to solve the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.619
 problems with the four operations and 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.660
 first-degree equations 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.670
 The school operates in a 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.860
 congregation of the Marists but the curriculum 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.170
 is determined by the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 the management says it does not do anything different 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.880
 only engages the student and the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.769
 family and celebrates 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.769
 we are all very happy because it is a 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.910
 achievement of a team is one direction 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.300
 who is ahead but has a team 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.130
 wonderful thing about a school that we give 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.680
 To our life this school goes to the 6th 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.810
 recognize the work of the school 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.730
 you have to improve because you have to study 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.090
 more in Portuguese and in all matters 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.250
 to pay attention to the planet that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.769
 the school's first a clean school 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.320
 organized where there is no lack of material 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.019
 school all contribute to the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.830
 student teacher partnership 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.760
 the approval rate here is in 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.280
 98.7 percent 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.350
 children understand the importance of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 discipline from time to time takes a 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.370
 but it looks good too. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.410
 some figurines forge 150 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 miles away with a reality well 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.549
 different 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.650
 the school irene pomegranate and sailors drew 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.299
 the worst note of the state network between 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.870
 students in the final years of 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.100
 fundamental ideb that was in 4 fell 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.690
 for three 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.329
 the director explains that many children 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.700
 do not stay in school all year long and 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.590
 some are missing to help parents in the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.750
 fishing business 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.060
 anyway, I was scared I stayed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.370
 Surprised I thought maybe we did not even 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.079
 we had achieved so much more that we 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.030
 had achieved some growth 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.280
 I was surprised 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.139
 the students themselves acknowledge that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.169
 lacking commitment to learning 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.900
 not only on their part do they say that 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:47.079
 families walk away from what is 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 taught here and then get notes 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.329
 good will come even greater challenge 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.790
 We, as a school, are very happy. 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.919
 When the father comes to school, he worries 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.230
 with 15 of the children 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.930
 this has little repetition occurred 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.239
 a special class has been created 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.730
 for students who have not passed the year is 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.090
 the case of Elizabeth who now wants to change 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.650
 Now I'm thinking of not if not stay 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.109
 plus 8th grade with a day that I was 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.549
 doing not disapprove the series and without 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.220
 move forward because in the future 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.320
 I want to do a college in the laboratory. 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.449
 few computers have been 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.889
 damaged by the 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.290
 own students 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.280
 new ones have arrived but have not yet been 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.530
 installed 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.150
 the science teacher recalls that even 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.820
 on a note 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440
 you can not give up school is the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.100
 opportunity we have to try 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.540
 seek all of them and believe that 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.889
 no one is a lost case 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.370
 he has to try to believe it and 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.479
 search 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.060
 two hundred the secretary of education 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.350
 informed that the computers were not 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.120
 still installed due to problems 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.430
 bureaucratic but this will be done 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.669
 in the coming days we'll fly now 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.889
 for alagoas that presented the worst ideb 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.139
 the country our flight time will be two 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.449
 hours and 55 minutes and we'll tell 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.520
