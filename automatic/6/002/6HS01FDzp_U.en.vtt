looking for a file called combine to SEM
dot<00:01:06.450> SLD<00:01:07.170> ASM<00:01:08.450> well<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.689> looks<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.110> renamed

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
dot SLD ASM well it looks like I renamed

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.700

it<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> renamed<00:01:12.320> file<00:01:13.320> right

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it you can see the renamed file right

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.090 
it you can see the renamed file right
there

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
there
now<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> could<00:01:16.170> fix<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
now one way that you could fix this is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
now one way that you could fix this is
just<00:01:16.890> name<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> was

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just name it back to what it was

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
just name it back to what it was
supposed<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.710> maybe<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
supposed to be but maybe you want to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.950 
supposed to be but maybe you want to
keep<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> new<00:01:21.119> name<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.720> part

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
keep the new name because the part

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
keep the new name because the part
number<00:01:22.170> has<00:01:22.259> changed<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.799> something<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
number has changed or something so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.190 
number has changed or something so
instead<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.360> we're<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.080> we're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
instead what we're going to do is we're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.510 
instead what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> double<00:01:25.680> click<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> name<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
going to double click on the name of the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.510 
going to double click on the name of the
file<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.740> ask<00:01:28.860> me<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.280> browse

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
file here and it will ask me to browse

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600 
file here and it will ask me to browse
to<00:01:29.549> where<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> new<00:01:30.390> file<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> also<00:01:32.250> might

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to where the new file is this also might

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
to where the new file is this also might
happen<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> files<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.689> moved<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.320> its

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
happen if the files been moved from its

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 
happen if the files been moved from its
original<00:01:34.590> location<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.670> point<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
original location so you can point to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
original location so you can point to
the<00:01:36.030> new<00:01:36.210> location<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> name<00:01:37.439> hasn't

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the new location even if the name hasn't

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
the new location even if the name hasn't
been<00:01:37.860> changed<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> found<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> file<00:01:39.750> that's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
been changed so I found the file that's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
been changed so I found the file that's
in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> same<00:01:40.409> folder<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.920> I'll<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.130> double

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
in the same folder so I'll just double

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
in the same folder so I'll just double
click<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> you'll<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> reference

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
click it you'll see that the reference

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
click it you'll see that the reference
is<00:01:43.290> changed<00:01:43.880> because<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.840> turned<00:01:46.110> green<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
is changed because it's turned green so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.499 
is changed because it's turned green so
we'll<00:01:47.700> click<00:01:47.880> OK

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
we'll click OK

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
there we go it's open and it's fixed we

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.830 
there we go it's open and it's fixed we
can<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.320> same<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.940> our<00:02:11.270> assemblies

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
can do the same thing in our assemblies

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.360 
can do the same thing in our assemblies
I'm<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.260> break<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.830> purpose<00:02:12.980> here

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
I'm going to break this on purpose here

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.570 
I'm going to break this on purpose here
so<00:02:13.520> I'm<00:02:13.610> going<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.760> pull<00:02:14.030> up<00:02:15.160> here's<00:02:16.160> our<00:02:16.340> file

that it works so I'm going to just open

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890 
that it works so I'm going to just open
up<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.530> assembly<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:26.150> you'll<00:02:26.300> see<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.570> opens

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
up the assembly and you'll see it opens

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.360 
up the assembly and you'll see it opens
and<00:02:27.110> you've<00:02:27.200> got<00:02:27.290> three<00:02:27.650> instances<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
same part floating around in there they

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.800 
same part floating around in there they
work<00:02:29.959> fine<00:02:30.230> now<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.370> open<00:02:31.790> up<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.330> file

the assembly again and now all of my

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.530 
the assembly again and now all of my
parts<00:02:46.940> came<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.390> suppressed<00:02:47.900> they're<00:02:48.680> missing

sometimes it'll prompt you to look for

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.630 
sometimes it'll prompt you to look for
the<00:02:51.739> file<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.630> sometimes<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.750> won't<00:02:53.900> here<00:02:54.410> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
the file but sometimes it won't here is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.070 
the file but sometimes it won't here is
all<00:02:55.640> my<00:02:55.940> parts<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.330> if<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.480> mouse<00:02:56.600> over<00:02:56.840> them
