00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
goes the the kid I got this room got it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.109 
goes the the kid I got this room got it
from<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> relative<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:22.340> took<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> cylinder

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
from a relative and took the cylinder

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.130 
from a relative and took the cylinder
head<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> valves<00:00:26.460> done

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
head in to have the valves done

head in to have the valves done
apparently<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.410> professionally

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
apparently it was all professionally

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.439 
apparently it was all professionally
done<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> won't<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> valve<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
done now I won't know how the valve is

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.640 
done now I won't know how the valve is
looking<00:00:30.720> till<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> pull<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> cylinder<00:00:31.349> head

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
looking till I pull the cylinder head

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
looking till I pull the cylinder head
off<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.820> he<00:00:33.059> couldn't<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.600> timed

off but he couldn't get the thing timed
he<00:00:35.040> said<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.399> backfiring<00:00:35.910> through<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
he said it was backfiring through the

Carver backfiring through the exhaust it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.619 
Carver backfiring through the exhaust it
could<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> hundred<00:00:38.760> eighty<00:00:39.030> degrees<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.570> of

could be a hundred eighty degrees out of

could be a hundred eighty degrees out of
time<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:41.070> no<00:00:41.250> idea

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
time I have no idea

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
time I have no idea
it<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.390> crank<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.260> jumpers<00:00:43.620> on

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it does crank over put some jumpers on

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240 
it does crank over put some jumpers on
it<00:00:45.110> now<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.620> wheel<00:00:46.770> drive<00:00:47.039> version

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it now this is a two wheel drive version

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
it now this is a two wheel drive version
some<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.730> parts<00:00:48.000> made<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.450> changes<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
some of these parts made or changes to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.639 
some of these parts made or changes to
four<00:00:49.050> wheel<00:00:49.230> drive<00:00:49.469> version<00:00:49.969> some<00:00:50.969> may<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.649> as

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
four wheel drive version some may not as

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.209 
four wheel drive version some may not as
far<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.210> klf<00:00:54.840> 302<00:00:55.739> wheel<00:00:55.920> drives

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
far as I know the klf 302 wheel drives

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.220 
far as I know the klf 302 wheel drives
were<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.180> same<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> years

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
were all the same for all the years

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.279 
were all the same for all the years
maybe<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.940> color<00:00:59.940> changes<00:01:00.449> graphic<00:01:00.899> changes

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
maybe some color changes graphic changes

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
maybe some color changes graphic changes
that's<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.489> far<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:02.940> they

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that's about it as far as I know they

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's about it as far as I know they
were<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> same<00:01:03.570> machine<00:01:03.870> though<00:01:04.049> I'm

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
were all the same machine though I'm

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:16.289 
were all the same machine though I'm
pretty<00:01:04.379> sure<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.359 

it's<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.140> single<00:01:17.380> headlight<00:01:17.829> I<00:01:17.860> didn't<00:01:18.220> think

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
it's a single headlight I didn't think

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's a single headlight I didn't think
they<00:01:18.520> had<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.700> double<00:01:19.090> headlight<00:01:19.450> version<00:01:21.030> two

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
they had a double headlight version two

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.090 
they had a double headlight version two
wheel<00:01:22.240> drive<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.869> one<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.229> think<00:01:29.439> has

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
wheel drive and this one I think has

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.510 
wheel drive and this one I think has
drum<00:01:30.729> brakes<00:01:31.030> on<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.420> front<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:33.189> look<00:01:33.369> like

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
drum brakes on the front they look like

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.669 
drum brakes on the front they look like
drums<00:01:36.720> hydraulic<00:01:37.720> drums<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.080> suppose<00:01:38.380> I'm<00:01:38.530> not

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
drums hydraulic drums I suppose I'm not

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:47.029 
drums hydraulic drums I suppose I'm not
real<00:01:38.860> familiar<00:01:39.009> at<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.429> with<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:39.759> machine

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.680 

it's<00:01:48.039> an<00:01:48.130> aftermarket<00:01:48.490> gas<00:01:48.850> tank<00:01:49.209> it<00:01:49.450> says

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
it's an aftermarket gas tank it says

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.480 
it's an aftermarket gas tank it says
Clark<00:01:50.080> on<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:50.440> cap<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:51.069> apparently<00:01:51.369> that's

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
Clark on the cap and apparently that's

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.370 
Clark on the cap and apparently that's
why<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.759> plastics<00:01:52.420> wouldn't<00:01:52.720> fit<00:01:52.899> back<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:53.350> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
why the plastics wouldn't fit back on I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.080 
why the plastics wouldn't fit back on I
don't<00:01:53.590> know<00:01:53.770> if<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.009> correct<00:01:54.399> for<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:54.789> year

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
don't know if it's correct for this year

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.669 
don't know if it's correct for this year
don't<00:01:55.360> know<00:01:55.600> yet<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:58.049> seats<00:01:59.049> been<00:01:59.289> poorly

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
don't know yet the seats been poorly

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:23.959 
don't know yet the seats been poorly
recovered<00:02:00.429> obviously<00:02:01.799> plastics<00:02:02.799> are<00:02:02.950> fair

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
good at being one of the back wheels

good at being one of the back wheels
there<00:02:26.439> I<00:02:26.469> have<00:02:26.709> another<00:02:26.859> whole<00:02:27.069> set<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.430> wheels
