00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:19.090
 [Music] 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.900
 all right 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 Y 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 [Music] 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.900
 i 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.440
 [Music] 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.440
 i 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.510
 [Music] 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.450
 well what it says here was to use a 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 series of arpeggios but in a way 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.839
 horizontal on the first rope 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.900
 For example, the first thing I did was 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.330
 play a C minor 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.320
 could this be 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.930
 [Music] 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 now like this vertically touched the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.820
 Notes are only two flats 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.409
 to touch it horizontally what 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.440
 I have to touch is everything 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.090
 fret 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.430
 everything in the first we have the eighth the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.550
 twelfth fret 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 so here in the twelfth I'm going to 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.980
 make the tap that is hitting that note 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 push it down 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.720
 and let it sound the back view that is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.260
 the 2nd 5th fret and then do a hammer 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.260
 ah 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.000
 Y 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 of your pair the C minor then which 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.980
 were those arpeggios 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.250
 we start with the C minor 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.150
 [Music] 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 greater sun 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.810
 returning lower 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.880
 May 9 major sun 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880
 sun 7 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.750
 then I repeat from the 2 minor 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:28.680
 I will have enough but now with 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.490
 this fingering 9 sound lower 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.640
 the flat major 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.319
 greater sun 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.409
 [Music] 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.409
 i 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.650
 then how did I put in the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.670
 first rope horizontally 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 all these arpeggios 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.460
 the first one we've already seen 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.530
 the second minor 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.990
 [Music] 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 then move the position of the hand 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.959
 left contrast back and that is 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.410
 would form with that a sun would form 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.410
 higher 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.850
 in 2000 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.850
 returning 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.069
 and now I move the tav to the 13th fret and 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.640
 the left hand to the frets 6 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.250
 and 10 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.610
 it's a bit long in the stretch of 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.610
 hand 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.920
 then he played the 12th fret but in the tap 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.920
 I let the string sound 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.430
 4 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.090
 [Music] 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.290
 there would be forming a greater sun and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.750
 then I change the tav to the 10 pinto fret 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.240
 the same 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.240
 [Music] 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.810
 in the second part what I do is something 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.390
 quite similar but with some 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.870
 variations then starts again in 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.870
 the C minor 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.780
 but I change the end 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.220
 then this is the tap on the 12th fret 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.160
 but first let's give the fret 8 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 and that is played twice 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 [Music] 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.930
 therefore it would be like this 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.120
 Y 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.460
 then I change the position of the hand 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.220
 left two frets up 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.620
 to touch the sun 7 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.620
 and I repeat what he says fairies 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.190
 with that little ornament at the end 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.190
 return in C minor 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.550
 and then changed the tav to the 13th fret and the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.730
 position of the left hand remains 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.590
 like that would be a flat E major 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:11.220
 [Music] 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.230
 and then I repeat both the sun greater than 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.600
 was 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.600
 in the air and in the fourth fret 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.890
 and the sun 7 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.590
 and ended 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:32.919
 this is all about this tutorial 

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:35.580
 I hope you like it and that it serves you and 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.580
 see you next
