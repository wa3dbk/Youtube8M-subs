00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you how 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.449
 make semi and beads from polymer clay 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.320
 we will need polymer clay red 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.160
 and black 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 golden nacre 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 unique gloss varnish such jars 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.280
 need to replace before light bulb and light bulb 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.600
 we also need jewelry cable 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 three round kontra different sizes 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.280
 emery sanding accessories 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.280
 paper 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.650
 texture sheet and liquid tools 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650
 plastic 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.460
 roll polymer clay thick 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.230
 about 2 millimeters 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.130
 we put some water on the texture sheet 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:18.610
 and we put clay well we press 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.690
 fingers or a rolling pin round which 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.690
 cut circle 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 this is the biggest circle and so 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.350
 I will put it on the bulb 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:07.920
 we put and we press on edge we put 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.920
 golden pearl on protruding parts 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.120
 we make such blanks of two colors one 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 big red circle 4 small 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.719
 black circles I took another 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.139
 drawing from the same stamp 4 medium 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:31.290
 black circles two medium 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.359
 a red circle and two small ones 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.129
 red circles 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.060
 bake it all at temperature 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:43.189
 indicated on your polymer clay 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.189
 then sandpaper sanding the edges 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.659
 Further we roll polymer clay 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.969
 about 1 millimeter thick on the side 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:58.379
 the edges of the workpiece apply liquid plastic 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:01.129
 and apply the clay blank well her 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.129
 pressing down 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.380
 further, using the blade cut by 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.380
 contour 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.570
 do the same with the rest 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:24.190
 blanks and bake again after 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.170
 baking also needs sanding the edges 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.610
 then we cover all the elements with glossy 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.220
 varnish in two layers further we still 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.560
 need a mini drill with 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.860
 whom we make a hole with two 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.860
 parties 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.800
 are you going to your knee right cable and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:05.570
 we string 2 strong and fuse from 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.570
 rubbing jewelry cable 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.200
 then the cable is passed back through 2 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.200
 climb and 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.720
 and we press 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.740
 we string on the ring 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.760
 gustatory jewelry cable leave 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.400
 small piece and pass it 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.860
 back bead 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:56.770
 then we move on in Korea and on the other 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.670
 the country is doing the same thing but already with 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.250
 a ring of chain and these are the beads 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.510
 they made me very beautiful 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.910
 look around your neck 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.850
 they can also be made in any color 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.900
 gamma and due to the fact that the beads are hollow 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.920
 the necklace turned out very light tanks 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.750
 Additions I made more such earrings 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.340
 I wish you a good mood and see you 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.940
 in the next video 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.940
 while only
