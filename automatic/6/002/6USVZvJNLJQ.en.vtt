00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
hated the Brazilian Blowout but with
this<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.190> hair<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.580> not<00:01:29.670> always<00:01:29.910> be<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
this my hair will not always be this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
this my hair will not always be this
straight

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
straight

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.750 
straight
and<00:01:31.050> supposedly<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.460> straight

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
and supposedly it will be this straight

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.620 
and supposedly it will be this straight
after<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> wash<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:36.270> will<00:01:36.450> be

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
after I wash it but it will be

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
after I wash it but it will be
manageable<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.620> will<00:01:37.800> still<00:01:38.010> be<00:01:38.159> able<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> curl

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
manageable I will still be able to curl

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
manageable I will still be able to curl
it<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.480> fixed<00:01:40.350> rate<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.590> an

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it so it's not fixed rate for an

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.790 
it so it's not fixed rate for an
investment<00:01:41.430> period<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.170> treatment

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
investment period but the treatment

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.620 
investment period but the treatment
costs<00:01:44.130> anywhere<00:01:44.490> from<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.180> hundred<00:01:45.510> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
costs anywhere from like two hundred to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.719 
costs anywhere from like two hundred to
five<00:01:45.810> hundred<00:01:45.840> dollars<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> salons

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
five hundred dollars and salons

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.080 
five hundred dollars and salons
um<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.860> supposed<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.400> last<00:01:50.700> anywhere

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
um and it's supposed to last anywhere

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
um and it's supposed to last anywhere
from<00:01:51.150> three<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> six<00:01:51.720> months<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.620> my

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
from three to six months and my

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
from three to six months and my
hairdresser<00:01:53.490> said<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.300> it's<00:01:54.600> been<00:01:54.840> lasting

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
hairdresser said that it's been lasting

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.940 
hairdresser said that it's been lasting
about<00:01:55.680> six<00:01:56.070> months<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.580> most<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.120> her<00:01:57.240> clients

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
about six months on most of her clients

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.990 
about six months on most of her clients
so<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.220> pretty<00:01:59.430> awesome

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so that's pretty awesome

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.680 
so that's pretty awesome
but<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.510> only<00:02:00.659> downfall<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.690> it's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
but the only downfall is that it's

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.960 
but the only downfall is that it's
Monday<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.650> really<00:02:04.920> can't<00:02:05.159> wash<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.520> hair

cool I guess for a change and but
hopefully<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.330> will<00:04:33.390> help<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.990> keep<00:04:34.140> my<00:04:34.320> hair
