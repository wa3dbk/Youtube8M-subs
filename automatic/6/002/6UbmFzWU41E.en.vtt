00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
going to extend around the garden and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
going to extend around the garden and
this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.879> really<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.449> that<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.720> nice<00:00:36.960> hot

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this is really so that in nice hot

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860 
this is really so that in nice hot
summer<00:00:37.620> weather<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.820> sit<00:00:39.090> back<00:00:39.330> in<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
summer weather we can sit back in a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.979 
summer weather we can sit back in a
recliner<00:00:40.320> catch<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.309> rays<00:00:41.660> sippin<00:00:42.660> gin<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
tonic and what trains go around the

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.020 
tonic and what trains go around the
garden<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.960> it'd<00:00:46.199> be<00:00:46.230> quite<00:00:46.470> nice<00:00:47.030> we're

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
garden I think it'd be quite nice we're

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
garden I think it'd be quite nice we're
going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.290> bit<00:00:49.410> unconventional

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
going to be a little bit unconventional

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
going to be a little bit unconventional
do<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> double-o<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.480> obviously<00:00:51.829> rest

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do it in double-o because obviously rest

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.200 
do it in double-o because obviously rest

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.690 
of the layouts in Dublin that's all the
stock<00:00:54.450> I've<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> possibly<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
stock I've got it is possibly a bit on

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.370 
stock I've got it is possibly a bit on
the<00:00:56.850> small<00:00:57.000> side<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.540> running<00:00:58.110> around<00:00:58.200> the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
the small side for running around the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.830 
the small side for running around the
garden<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.130> people<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.030> done<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> with

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
garden but people have done it with

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.569 
garden but people have done it with
great<00:01:01.140> effect<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:02.040> gonna<00:01:02.160> give<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> go

as well so what we've done outside in
the<00:01:05.759> garden<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.390> we've<00:01:06.869> laid<00:01:07.410> some

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the garden is we've laid some

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
the garden is we've laid some
foundations<00:01:08.399> now<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.270> garden<00:01:09.660> the<00:01:09.960> soil

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
foundations now the garden the soil

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
foundations now the garden the soil
where<00:01:10.560> the--<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.520> track<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.090> gonna<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.420> round

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
where the-- the track is gonna go round

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.510 
where the-- the track is gonna go round
slopes<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> didn't<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
slopes little bit and I didn't want to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.510 
slopes little bit and I didn't want to
have<00:01:14.759> wood<00:01:15.649> in<00:01:16.649> contact<00:01:17.190> with<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.369> ground

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
have wood in contact with the ground

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
have wood in contact with the ground
because<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.850> gets<00:01:18.030> rotten<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:19.050> I<00:01:19.170> can't<00:01:19.380> be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
because it gets rotten and I can't be

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
because it gets rotten and I can't be
bothered<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.550> I've<00:01:20.850> built<00:01:21.090> some

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
bothered with that so I've built some

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
bothered with that so I've built some
brick<00:01:21.750> piers<00:01:22.080> sat<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.190> concrete<00:01:23.700> Clint's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
brick piers sat on some concrete Clint's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.779 
brick piers sat on some concrete Clint's
and<00:01:24.660> these<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.709> then<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:26.069> have<00:01:26.459> some

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
and these are then gonna have some

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.480 
and these are then gonna have some
mounting<00:01:27.240> points<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.929> fence<00:01:28.679> type<00:01:29.009> posts

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
mounting points for fence type posts

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.699 
mounting points for fence type posts
very<00:01:29.759> short<00:01:30.000> fence<00:01:30.179> type<00:01:30.450> posts<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.560> will

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
very short fence type posts that will

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.520 
very short fence type posts that will
then<00:01:31.830> hold<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.490> wooden<00:01:32.849> frame<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:34.440> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
then hold the wooden frame that the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850 
then hold the wooden frame that the
track<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.069> laid<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.619> yeah<00:01:37.619> that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
track will be laid on and yeah that's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.650 
track will be laid on and yeah that's
that's<00:01:38.250> probably<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> easiest<00:01:38.910> but<00:01:39.119> easy<00:01:39.390> bit

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
that's probably the easiest but easy bit

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.270 
that's probably the easiest but easy bit
is<00:01:39.780> loading<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.080> track<00:01:40.319> what<00:01:40.770> we've<00:01:40.890> gotta<00:01:41.069> do

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
is loading the track what we've gotta do

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100 
is loading the track what we've gotta do
before<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:41.819> let's<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.539> all<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:42.780> done<00:01:42.929> so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
before then let's get all this done so

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
before then let's get all this done so
I've<00:01:43.410> laid<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.679> lot<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.190> brickwork<00:01:44.990> she's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I've laid a lot of the brickwork she's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.320 
I've laid a lot of the brickwork she's
got<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> finish<00:01:46.319> that<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:46.709> but<00:01:47.039> also<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:48.179> have

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
got to finish that off but also we have

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.150 
got to finish that off but also we have
to<00:01:48.479> make<00:01:48.660> some<00:01:48.840> holes<00:01:49.080> through<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> wall<00:01:49.920> in

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
to make some holes through the wall in

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.440 
to make some holes through the wall in
the<00:01:50.280> shed<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.580> this<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.849> be<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.149> daunting

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the shed and this can be a bit daunting

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
the shed and this can be a bit daunting
to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.140> honest<00:01:52.410> when<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.160> built<00:01:53.459> the<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:53.819> you've

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to be honest when I built the now you've

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
to be honest when I built the now you've
probably<00:01:54.360> noticed<00:01:54.660> from<00:01:55.229> previous<00:01:55.679> videos<00:01:55.860> at

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
probably noticed from previous videos at

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.370 
probably noticed from previous videos at
the<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.550> least<00:01:56.789> that<00:01:57.209> there<00:01:58.020> are<00:01:58.140> tracks

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

no idea the time really of even how I
was<00:02:07.890> gonna<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.520> certainly<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
was gonna do but certainly not the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.690 
was gonna do but certainly not the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
marches on and here we are so we've

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.510

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
started cutting through the shed I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760 
started cutting through the shed I
finished<00:02:18.300> one<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.989> way<00:02:19.140> through<00:02:19.560> we've

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
finished one of the way through we've

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.890 
finished one of the way through we've
literally<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.340> light<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.540> end<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
literally got light at the end of the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.220 
literally got light at the end of the
tunnel<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.390> we've<00:02:24.390> protected<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
tunnel and we've protected on the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920 
tunnel and we've protected on the
outside<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:25.920> sort<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.519> lean-to<00:02:27.030> roof<00:02:27.360> and

one side quite carefully but we haven't

hinges that can be locked shut I don't

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.039 
hinges that can be locked shut I don't
really<00:03:56.849> want<00:03:57.060> people<00:03:57.389> putting<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.689> hounds

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
really want people putting the hounds

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.360 
really want people putting the hounds
through<00:03:58.260> France<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.739> seeing<00:03:59.099> what<00:03:59.219> they<00:03:59.340> can

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
through France and seeing what they can

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.660 
through France and seeing what they can
steal<00:04:00.170> but<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.290> also<00:04:01.499> stops<00:04:01.980> vermin<00:04:02.459> from

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
steal but it also stops vermin from

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.860 
steal but it also stops vermin from
getting<00:04:02.909> into<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> sheds<00:04:03.389> we<00:04:03.540> don't<00:04:03.719> want

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
getting into the sheds we don't want

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.750 
getting into the sheds we don't want
that<00:04:03.959> either<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.889> we've<00:04:04.980> got<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.129> good<00:04:05.400> tight

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
that either so we've got a good tight

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.580 
that either so we've got a good tight
fit<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.329> fiberglass<00:04:06.749> on<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.170> track<00:04:07.409> also

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
fit and the fiberglass on the track also

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.099 
fit and the fiberglass on the track also
helps<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.310> seal<00:04:09.029> up<00:04:09.239> any<00:04:09.420> gaps<00:04:09.689> that<00:04:09.989> there

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
helps to seal up any gaps that there

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.390 
helps to seal up any gaps that there
would<00:04:10.230> be<00:04:10.260> around<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.799> rails<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.189> make<00:04:11.370> sure

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
would be around the rails but make sure

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.280 
would be around the rails but make sure
you<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.569> there<00:04:12.749> with<00:04:12.900> something<00:04:13.049> like<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
you get in there with something like a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.920 
you get in there with something like a
needle<00:04:13.769> file<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.639> clear<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.029> fibre<00:04:15.269> grass<00:04:15.599> off

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
needle file to clear the fibre grass off

the<00:04:16.079> rail<00:04:16.290> heads<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.459> inner<00:04:17.670> edges<00:04:17.880> so

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
the rail heads and the inner edges so

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.050 
the rail heads and the inner edges so
that<00:04:18.359> trains<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.989> still<00:04:19.500> pass<00:04:19.739> through

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
that trains can still pass through

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.760 
that trains can still pass through
without<00:04:21.060> any<00:04:21.329> problems<00:04:22.019> with<00:04:22.170> electrical
