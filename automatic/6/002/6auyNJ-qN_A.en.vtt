 so today we find ourselves on 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.270
 facebook one for the eye rubeiz cupcakes 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.030
 so let's go for the recipe of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.400
 angry birds cupcake you will need 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.400
 icing sugar and butter 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.960
 dyes for icing muffin therefore 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.150
 I took some chocolate you can 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.970
 take classics and for the decoration 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.750
 orange almond paste and a 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.190
 white marshmallow and the vallier pen 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 who simply for the decor at 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.960
 chocolate you put your butter that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.240
 you see is ointment that means who 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.460
 is very soft in a salad bowl 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 quantities it's a spoonful of butter 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.520
 for 3 of an icing sugar so the gemmi of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 qr of butter so I'm going to put six 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.390
 spoons of icing sugar 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.259
 So here and there you are well 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.420
 mix with spoon first and 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.729
 then whisk or beater 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.439
 electric if you wish and you 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.509
 can add a very small tip 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:43.060
 from the air and there you mix once that 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.219
 done you can add aromas in 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 according to your tastes and you go 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.920
 split in two and we will add the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.780
 dye so that's what I get 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.369
 I will add a little bit of flavor 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.579
 of vanilla seen I think it's great 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.280
 so in one we will put 2 3 drops 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.619
 red dye no more if ever 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.569
 it's too liquid you just add 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.110
 a little bit of icing sugar and you're 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.750
 mix 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.940
 and and then in the other of the dye 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 yellow and that's the result 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.950
 you just have to garnish the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.000
 cupcakes so let's go to garnish 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.480
 the cakes so you're going to put your 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.360
 icing on it and spread it well and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.340
 then it will be necessary to put the fine hands 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.040
 in the fridge for the icing to take 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.290
 well icing and well taken and we're going 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.110
 can now go to the decoration so 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 for that I took the malo sleeves and 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.459
 almond paste 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.410
 so I formed various small form to 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.270
 using the simple style as per 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.130
 example a sleeve socket 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.610
 so firstly what are we going to do 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.959
 it's just putting a 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:02.680
 half-match malo on the ba hung in fine 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:08.950
 like this then we will put the nose 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:12.190
 up the beak earlier so here you are 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 see huh it's not complicated and that 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.850
 takes shape very quickly and then 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:26.530
 you will take your eyes each time 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:34.120
 and you're going to marry him pretty close to 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:36.640
 beak like real angry birds here must 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:43.989
 well supported like that they are good 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.680
 stuck to the icing and it does not move so 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.280
 this is the first step is over 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.150
 and then you go beyond doing 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.430
 the finishes with the tube vahinÃ© nos 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.760
 for that it's very simple you go 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.260
 perform a weight in each eye 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.590
 and then there are only 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.590
 eyebrows 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:24.860
 and we can finish them by adding the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:28.680
 little wick k7 angry birds 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.139
 that's it the angry birds are finished 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.539
 so I particularly like them 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.400
 I find them super fun so here we go 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.120
 we will be able to go directly to 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.100
 tasting 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:45.840
 so let's go for the tasting 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.699
 if the recipe you have much more hesitates 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.169
