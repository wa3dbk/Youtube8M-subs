so<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:01.829> gonna<00:00:01.949> look<00:00:02.250> at<00:00:02.520> what<00:00:03.000> actually

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so we're gonna look at what actually

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.300 
so we're gonna look at what actually
happens<00:00:04.049> if<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.350> do<00:00:04.529> have<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> hole<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.069> your

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
happens if you do have a hole in your

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.049 
happens if you do have a hole in your
hull<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.899> much<00:00:07.309> pumping<00:00:08.309> capacity<00:00:08.460> you

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hull and how much pumping capacity you

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.459 
hull and how much pumping capacity you
really<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:10.050> all<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.280> your<00:00:11.639> pumps<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:13.170> down

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
really have in all of your pumps so down

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.980 
really have in all of your pumps so down
here<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.980> actually<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.700> my<00:00:15.120> bilge<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.839> have

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
here I actually have my bilge and I have

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.099 
here I actually have my bilge and I have
two<00:00:16.440> electric<00:00:17.039> pumps<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.699> two<00:00:18.359> hand<00:00:18.750> pumps<00:00:19.939> so

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
two electric pumps and two hand pumps so

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.240 
two electric pumps and two hand pumps so
first<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:24.140> only<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
first you can see I have only got one of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.250 
first you can see I have only got one of
my<00:00:26.400> bilge<00:00:26.760> pumps<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.769> on<00:00:28.769> auto<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.260> I've

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
my bilge pumps up on auto here and I've

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.569 
my bilge pumps up on auto here and I've
turned<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.710> off<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> idea<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
turned one off so the idea is here I'm

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
turned one off so the idea is here I'm
just<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> add<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> water

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
just going to add a bit of water

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
just going to add a bit of water
just<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.489> exactly<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.110> point<00:00:40.730> where<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
just to see exactly the point where it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
just to see exactly the point where it
starts<00:00:42.360> turning<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
starts turning on so there you go that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.720 
starts turning on so there you go that
blue<00:00:47.670> float<00:00:48.120> switch<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.800> has<00:00:49.800> activated<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
blue float switch there has activated it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
blue float switch there has activated it
and<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> chug<00:00:52.590> away<00:00:52.860> there

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and it's just going to chug away there

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.720 
and it's just going to chug away there
for<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> couple<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.820> seconds<00:00:54.270> and<00:01:00.079> now<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> stops

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
for a couple of seconds and now it stops

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
for a couple of seconds and now it stops
so<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.199> add<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so now what I'm going to do is add a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
so now what I'm going to do is add a
known<00:01:05.220> quantity<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.119> water<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.200> I'm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
known quantity of water and what I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
known quantity of water and what I'm
simply<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.040> there<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
simply going to do there is I'm going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.830 
simply going to do there is I'm going to
add<00:01:09.299> exactly<00:01:09.689> five<00:01:10.290> gallons<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:12.119> from

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
add exactly five gallons into that from

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.740 
add exactly five gallons into that from
here<00:01:16.369> okay<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.820> five<00:01:18.090> gallons<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
here okay so have my five gallons here

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
here okay so have my five gallons here
in<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.990> drug<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:20.040> I've<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:20.460> them<00:01:20.549> back<00:01:20.729> here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
in this drug if I've got them back here

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
in this drug if I've got them back here
that<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.420> pour<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> got<00:01:23.159> my

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that I'm just going to pour in I got my

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.090 
that I'm just going to pour in I got my
stopwatch<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.060> already<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.830> reason

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
stopwatch here already and the reason

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.940 
stopwatch here already and the reason
we're<00:01:26.250> doing<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> gallons

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
we're doing that is because the gallons

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
we're doing that is because the gallons
per<00:01:29.220> minute<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> packets

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
per minute that you see on the packets

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
per minute that you see on the packets
are<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.409> ideal

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
are really in very very very ideal

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
are really in very very very ideal
situations<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> lift<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:37.740> much

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
situations you have the lift of how much

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.410 
situations you have the lift of how much
hose<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> contend<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.329> all

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
hose you have to contend with in all

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.340 
hose you have to contend with in all
things<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:41.600> let's<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.229> long

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
things like this so let's see how long

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.450 
things like this so let's see how long
it<00:01:43.500> takes<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.890> pump<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.310> five<00:01:44.640> gallons<00:01:46.460> that's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it takes to pump out five gallons that's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.950 
it takes to pump out five gallons that's
that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.520 

today<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.530> working<00:01:58.799> away<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.530> with

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
today you see it's working away and with

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
today you see it's working away and with
timing<00:02:01.950> how<00:02:02.100> long<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.580> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> take<00:02:03.530> when

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
timing how long it's going to take when

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:17.270 
timing how long it's going to take when
I<00:02:04.560> stop<00:02:04.920> watch<00:02:05.130> yeah<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:17.010> we're

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
I stop watch yeah so here we go we're

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.479 
I stop watch yeah so here we go we're
getting<00:02:17.520> close<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.030> end<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:19.489> pumping

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
getting close to the end now pumping

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.120 
getting close to the end now pumping
away<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:22.080> we're<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> one

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
away and you can see we're up to one

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.670 
away and you can see we're up to one
minute<00:02:23.280> 18<00:02:23.640> seconds<00:02:28.730> almost<00:02:29.730> done<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
minute 18 seconds almost done so it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
minute 18 seconds almost done so it
should<00:02:31.920> turn<00:02:32.220> off<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:32.760> why<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.030> put

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
should turn off and that's why we put

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.020 
should turn off and that's why we put
the<00:02:33.660> initial<00:02:34.080> amount<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.489> 1<00:02:35.790> minute

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the initial amount in so it's 1 minute

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.840 
the initial amount in so it's 1 minute
30<00:02:36.510> seconds<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.010> that's<00:02:38.250> why<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.550> put<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
30 seconds and that's why we put the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240 
30 seconds and that's why we put the
initial<00:02:39.090> amount<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.600> water<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.100> could

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
initial amount of water in so we could

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.910 
initial amount of water in so we could
get<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.400> exactly<00:02:42.060> at<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.390> level<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.959> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
get it exactly at the level that that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.630 
get it exactly at the level that that
pump<00:02:44.280> turns<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:45.049> so<00:02:46.049> 1<00:02:46.350> minute<00:02:46.530> 30<00:02:46.980> seconds

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
pump turns off so 1 minute 30 seconds

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.750 
pump turns off so 1 minute 30 seconds
for<00:02:48.180> 5<00:02:48.450> gallons<00:02:50.750> that's<00:02:51.750> about<00:02:52.370> 3<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.489> 4

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
for 5 gallons that's about 3 to 4

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.789 
for 5 gallons that's about 3 to 4
gallons<00:02:54.299> per<00:02:54.810> minute<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.350> could<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.769> math

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
gallons per minute you could do the math

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.979 
gallons per minute you could do the math
we're<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.910> carry<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.540> test<00:02:57.720> some<00:02:57.959> of

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
we're going to carry on and test some of

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.090 
we're going to carry on and test some of
our<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.350> pumps<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.620> are<00:03:01.650> ready<00:03:01.950> to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
our other pumps so here we are ready to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.640 
our other pumps so here we are ready to
test<00:03:02.370> our<00:03:02.549> second<00:03:03.000> pump<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.410> see

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
test our second pump and you can see

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.819 
test our second pump and you can see
this<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.880> yellow<00:03:06.239> one<00:03:06.450> right<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:07.079> it's

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
this is this yellow one right here it's

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.550 
this is this yellow one right here it's
a<00:03:08.070> whale<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.959> how<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> surface

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
a whale and you can see how the surface

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.780 
a whale and you can see how the surface
of<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.920> water<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.670> actually

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
of the water this one is actually

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
of the water this one is actually
shallower<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.290> bilge<00:03:16.560> pump<00:03:16.859> is<00:03:17.010> further

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
shallower so this bilge pump is further

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.590 
shallower so this bilge pump is further
up<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.910> see<00:03:18.030> here<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.480> actual

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
up and you can see here is the actual

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.250 
up and you can see here is the actual
inlet<00:03:19.079> from<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> two<00:03:19.739> manuals<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.489> have

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
inlet from one of the two manuals I have

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.569 
inlet from one of the two manuals I have
and<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.560> actually<00:03:22.799> hasn't<00:03:23.070> rated<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
and so this actually hasn't rated on it

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.060 
and so this actually hasn't rated on it
so<00:03:23.760> let's<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.150> how<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.540> compares<00:03:24.690> I've<00:03:25.560> set<00:03:26.040> it

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
so let's see how it compares I've set it

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.360 
so let's see how it compares I've set it
up<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:26.760> all<00:03:27.530> right<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.739> level<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.190> just

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
up so it's all right at the level I just

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.099 
up so it's all right at the level I just
put<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> little<00:03:29.670> bit<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.970> water<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:30.870> here's

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
put a little bit of water in so here's

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.220 
put a little bit of water in so here's
my<00:03:31.260> same<00:03:31.620> 5<00:03:31.980> gallon<00:03:32.400> bucket<00:03:32.910> I'm<00:03:33.870> gonna<00:03:34.049> press

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
my same 5 gallon bucket I'm gonna press

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.500 
my same 5 gallon bucket I'm gonna press
Start<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.400> let's<00:03:35.730> see<00:03:35.910> how<00:03:36.090> long<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.390> guy

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
Start and let's see how long this guy

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.420 
Start and let's see how long this guy
takes

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.539 

and<00:03:43.719> there<00:03:44.719> he<00:03:44.810> goes

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
and there he goes

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.959 
and there he goes
starting<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.670> pump<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.340> I'm<00:03:52.459> gonna<00:03:52.609> pause

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:52.969 
starting to pump and I'm gonna pause

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.910 
starting to pump and I'm gonna pause
this<00:03:53.209> video<00:03:53.540> cuz<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.379> is<00:03:54.500> gonna<00:03:54.620> take<00:03:54.890> a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
this video cuz this is gonna take a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.479 
this video cuz this is gonna take a
little<00:03:55.129> while<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.340> think<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:57.950> go<00:03:58.129> we're

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
little while I think so here we go we're

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.759 
little while I think so here we go we're
starting<00:03:58.879> to<00:03:58.970> come<00:03:59.209> close<00:03:59.659> back<00:04:00.019> to<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.379> level

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
starting to come close back to the level

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.000 
starting to come close back to the level
we're<00:04:01.730> up<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:02.060> 115<00:04:04.870> that's<00:04:05.870> same<00:04:06.200> five<00:04:06.500> gallons

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
we're up to 115 that's same five gallons

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.490 
we're up to 115 that's same five gallons
the<00:04:07.939> light<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.299> coming<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.780> kind<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.079> tricky<00:04:09.469> to

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the light is coming in kind of tricky to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.500 
the light is coming in kind of tricky to
see<00:04:09.859> there<00:04:10.129> and<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:12.019> stops<00:04:12.379> at<00:04:12.620> 125<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.389> it's

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
see there and it stops at 125 so it's

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.599 
see there and it stops at 125 so it's
actually<00:04:14.629> about<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.200> same<00:04:15.439> so<00:04:16.220> now<00:04:16.370> let's

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
actually about the same so now let's

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.189 
actually about the same so now let's
look<00:04:16.699> at<00:04:17.000> some<00:04:17.209> math<00:04:19.449> okay<00:04:20.449> so<00:04:20.509> let's<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:20.989> some

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
look at some math okay so let's do some

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.900 
look at some math okay so let's do some
math<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.889> hope<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.310> see<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.610> on<00:04:22.789> this

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
math and I hope you can see this on this

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.600 
math and I hope you can see this on this
piece<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.210> paper<00:04:23.349> we<00:04:24.349> did<00:04:24.530> five<00:04:24.830> gallons<00:04:25.340> in

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
piece of paper we did five gallons in

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.210 
piece of paper we did five gallons in
about<00:04:26.120> one<00:04:26.419> minute<00:04:26.539> thirty<00:04:26.900> seconds<00:04:27.410> so

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
about one minute thirty seconds so

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.240 
about one minute thirty seconds so
that's<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.460> gallon<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.030> every<00:04:29.240> 18<00:04:29.570> seconds<00:04:30.250> you

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
that's a gallon in every 18 seconds you

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.270 
that's a gallon in every 18 seconds you
can<00:04:31.400> work<00:04:31.580> out<00:04:31.789> how<00:04:31.820> many<00:04:32.270> gallons<00:04:32.570> per<00:04:32.840> minute

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
can work out how many gallons per minute

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.510 
can work out how many gallons per minute
60<00:04:34.280> divided<00:04:35.000> by<00:04:35.030> 18<00:04:35.599> so<00:04:36.590> our<00:04:36.710> pumps<00:04:37.130> both<00:04:37.370> of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
60 divided by 18 so our pumps both of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.700 
60 divided by 18 so our pumps both of
those<00:04:37.639> are<00:04:37.849> about<00:04:38.000> 3<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:38.570> 1/3<00:04:38.660> gallons<00:04:39.440> per

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
those are about 3 and 1/3 gallons per

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.520 
those are about 3 and 1/3 gallons per
minute<00:04:39.940> which<00:04:40.940> works<00:04:41.210> out<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.449> 200<00:04:42.349> gallons

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
minute which works out to 200 gallons

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.430 
minute which works out to 200 gallons
per<00:04:42.979> hour<00:04:43.190> if<00:04:43.520> we<00:04:43.639> multiply<00:04:44.060> by<00:04:44.210> 60<00:04:44.690> that's

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
per hour if we multiply by 60 that's

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.820 
per hour if we multiply by 60 that's
considerably<00:04:46.310> less<00:04:46.820> than<00:04:47.419> all<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.229> thousand

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
considerably less than all the thousand

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.439 
considerably less than all the thousand
1,500<00:04:49.729> gph<00:04:50.360> you'll<00:04:50.720> see<00:04:50.930> on<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.199> boxes<00:04:52.449> now

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
1,500 gph you'll see on the boxes now

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.370 
1,500 gph you'll see on the boxes now
let's<00:04:53.599> see<00:04:53.780> what<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:53.960> actually<00:04:54.139> means<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
let's see what that actually means the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.170 
let's see what that actually means the
amount<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.680> water<00:04:57.919> coming<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.580> hole<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:58.849> can

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
amount of water coming in a hole you can

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.960 
amount of water coming in a hole you can
find<00:04:59.479> by<00:04:59.690> multiplying<00:05:00.199> 20<00:05:00.740> by<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.340> diameter

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
find by multiplying 20 by the diameter

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.089 
find by multiplying 20 by the diameter
of<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> hole<00:05:02.120> by<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.960> square<00:05:03.349> root<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.770> the

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
of the hole by the square root of the

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.089 
of the hole by the square root of the
depth<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.639> hole<00:05:04.669> H<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.630> my<00:05:06.500> boat<00:05:06.710> if<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:06.949> got

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
depth of the hole H and my boat if I got

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.439 
depth of the hole H and my boat if I got
a<00:05:07.130> hole<00:05:07.310> right<00:05:07.340> on<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.789> bottom<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.210> would<00:05:08.300> be

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
a hole right on the bottom that would be

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.290 
a hole right on the bottom that would be
4<00:05:08.720> feet<00:05:08.960> down<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:10.430> let's<00:05:10.580> make<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.789> one-inch

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
4 feet down so let's make a one-inch

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.480 
4 feet down so let's make a one-inch
diameter<00:05:11.510> hole<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.919> water<00:05:13.130> coming

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
diameter hole so the water coming

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.980 
diameter hole so the water coming
through<00:05:13.520> will<00:05:13.760> be<00:05:13.789> 20<00:05:14.500> times<00:05:15.500> 1<00:05:16.000> times<00:05:17.000> 2<00:05:17.449> which

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
through will be 20 times 1 times 2 which

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.680 
through will be 20 times 1 times 2 which
is<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.260> square<00:05:18.530> root<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.830> 4<00:05:19.070> which<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.940> 40

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
is the square root of 4 which is 40

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.600 
is the square root of 4 which is 40
gallons<00:05:21.260> per<00:05:21.560> minute<00:05:23.500> my<00:05:24.500> pumps<00:05:24.860> do<00:05:25.039> 3<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.520> 1/3

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
gallons per minute my pumps do 3 and 1/3

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.600 
gallons per minute my pumps do 3 and 1/3
gallons<00:05:26.300> per<00:05:26.539> minute<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.830> that's<00:05:27.949> for<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.340> hole

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
gallons per minute so that's for a hole

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.060 
gallons per minute so that's for a hole
this<00:05:29.449> size<00:05:31.000> 40<00:05:32.000> gallons<00:05:32.330> per<00:05:32.510> minute<00:05:33.070> two

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
this size 40 gallons per minute two

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.029 
this size 40 gallons per minute two
electric<00:05:34.490> pumps<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.090> two<00:05:35.659> hand<00:05:35.930> pumps<00:05:36.320> aren't

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
electric pumps and two hand pumps aren't

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.550 
electric pumps and two hand pumps aren't
gonna<00:05:37.280> be<00:05:37.400> anywhere<00:05:37.699> near<00:05:37.940> enough<00:05:38.289> to<00:05:39.289> stop

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
gonna be anywhere near enough to stop

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.970 
gonna be anywhere near enough to stop
that<00:05:39.830> sinking<00:05:40.699> the<00:05:40.820> boat
