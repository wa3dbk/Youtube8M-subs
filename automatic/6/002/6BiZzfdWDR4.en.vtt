of rocket loose because these are pretty

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.400 
of rocket loose because these are pretty
flimsy<00:02:35.800> pieces<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.730> plastic<00:02:37.300> as<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:38.200> see

flimsy pieces of plastic as you see

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.070 
flimsy pieces of plastic as you see
doing<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:39.070> before<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.850> kind<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.840> put<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.020> little

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
doing this before I kind of put a little

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.020 
doing this before I kind of put a little
bit<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.410> crack<00:02:41.650> right<00:02:41.890> here<00:02:42.100> where<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> micro

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
bit of crack right here where the micro

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.300 
bit of crack right here where the micro
USB<00:02:43.450> slot<00:02:43.480> comes<00:02:43.960> through<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.190> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
USB slot comes through so you do have to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.330 
USB slot comes through so you do have to
be<00:02:45.460> really<00:02:45.700> careful<00:02:46.470> put<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.650> down<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.100> and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
be really careful put that down here and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580 
be really careful put that down here and
this<00:02:49.030> one<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.300> even<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:50.020> little<00:02:50.140> bit<00:02:50.350> more

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
this one is even a little bit more

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.460 
this one is even a little bit more
difficult<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.250> take<00:02:51.430> off<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.300> your<00:02:53.110> best<00:02:53.320> bet

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
difficult to take off so your best bet

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.850 
difficult to take off so your best bet
is<00:02:53.620> probably<00:02:54.040> starting<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.030> corners<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
is probably starting at the corners and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.730 
is probably starting at the corners and
then<00:02:56.860> rocking<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.520> down<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:59.110> this<00:02:59.410> came<00:02:59.590> out

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
then rocking it down now this came out

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.490 
then rocking it down now this came out
pretty<00:02:59.890> easily<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.810> I've<00:03:01.810> done<00:03:02.050> this<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
pretty easily because I've done this a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.710 
pretty easily because I've done this a
couple<00:03:02.590> times<00:03:03.250> already<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:03.880> generally

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
couple times already but generally

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.120 
couple times already but generally
you're<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.020> want<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.170> go<00:03:05.320> very<00:03:05.770> slowly

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
you're going to want to go very slowly

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.250 
you're going to want to go very slowly
with<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.120> lest<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.990> crack

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
with this you know lest you you crack

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.100 
with this you know lest you you crack
the<00:03:08.410> plastic<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:09.210> all<00:03:10.210> right<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.630> let<00:03:10.990> me

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
read it or to be able to format it into

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.569 
read it or to be able to format it into
usable<00:04:06.980> condition<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:09.190> that's<00:04:10.190> something<00:04:10.430> to

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
usable condition so that's something to

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.860 
usable condition so that's something to
know<00:04:10.790> when<00:04:10.970> you're<00:04:11.090> going<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.239> swap<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.569> cards

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
know when you're going to swap the cards

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.110 
know when you're going to swap the cards
out<00:04:12.019> now<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.530> didn't<00:04:12.799> have<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:12.950> 32<00:04:13.250> gigabyte<00:04:13.670> card

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
out now I didn't have a 32 gigabyte card

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.610 
out now I didn't have a 32 gigabyte card
lying<00:04:14.390> around<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.900> I'm<00:04:15.109> just<00:04:15.230> going<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.410> use

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
lying around so I'm just going to use

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.390 
lying around so I'm just going to use
another<00:04:15.829> 16<00:04:16.459> gig<00:04:16.699> here<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:18.229> will<00:04:18.590> still

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
another 16 gig here but you will still

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.480 
another 16 gig here but you will still
get<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.989> gist

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 
get the gist

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.320 
get the gist
so<00:04:22.490> once<00:04:22.910> we<00:04:23.060> have<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.360> card<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.870> just<00:04:25.150> pop<00:04:26.150> it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
so once we have the card we just pop it

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.590 
so once we have the card we just pop it
back<00:04:26.360> in<00:04:26.720> here<00:04:27.669> then<00:04:28.669> you<00:04:28.910> want<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.150> put<00:04:29.389> the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
back in here then you want to put the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.230 
back in here then you want to put the
pieces<00:04:29.900> back<00:04:30.199> in<00:04:30.260> in<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.949> reverse<00:04:31.789> order<00:04:34.240> now

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
pieces back in in the reverse order now

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.940 
pieces back in in the reverse order now

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
Windows Phone 7 devices I found it just

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.600 
Windows Phone 7 devices I found it just
using<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.590> regular<00:04:48.710> card<00:04:49.190> worked<00:04:49.639> out<00:04:49.820> fine<00:04:50.500> but

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
using a regular card worked out fine but

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.279 
using a regular card worked out fine but
you<00:04:52.610> know<00:04:52.729> Microsoft<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.599> AT&amp;T<00:04:53.900> they

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
you know Microsoft and AT&amp;T they

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.190 
you know Microsoft and AT&amp;T they
recommend<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.039> you<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.630> use<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.020> ones

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
recommend that you that you use the ones

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.409 
recommend that you that you use the ones
that<00:04:57.410> are<00:04:57.500> certified<00:04:57.979> so<00:04:58.880> once<00:04:59.210> we've<00:04:59.389> got

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
that are certified so once we've got

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.990 
that are certified so once we've got
this<00:04:59.720> back<00:04:59.960> together<00:05:01.000> put<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.120> battery<00:05:02.510> in

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
this back together put the battery in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.129

now<00:05:05.000> one<00:05:05.180> thing<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.419> would<00:05:05.570> recommend<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:06.080> that

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
now one thing I would recommend is that

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.170 
now one thing I would recommend is that

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
you don't put the screws in back in

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.850 
you don't put the screws in back in
until<00:05:08.510> you've<00:05:08.720> tested<00:05:09.169> this<00:05:09.260> out<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.710> make

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
until you've tested this out and make

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.830 
until you've tested this out and make
