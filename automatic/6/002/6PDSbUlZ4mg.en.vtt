cars and I got three videos here for

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.400 
cars and I got three videos here for
this<00:04:27.400> one<00:04:27.610> people<00:04:28.390> driving<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.050> many<00:04:29.140> some

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
this one people driving as so many some

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.260 
this one people driving as so many some
of<00:04:29.530> these<00:04:29.620> but<00:04:29.950> apparently<00:04:30.730> people<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.180> to

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
of these but apparently people like to

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.670 
of these but apparently people like to
drive<00:04:31.450> around<00:04:31.510> in<00:04:31.780> Europe<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.290> wrecked<00:04:32.590> cars

drive around in Europe and wrecked cars

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.650 
drive around in Europe and wrecked cars
because<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.190> think<00:04:33.520> it's<00:04:34.000> Europe<00:04:34.240> that's<00:04:34.450> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
because I think it's Europe that's the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:54.960 
because I think it's Europe that's the
least<00:04:34.810> what<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.080> looks<00:04:35.230> like<00:04:35.440> but<00:04:35.740> yeah
