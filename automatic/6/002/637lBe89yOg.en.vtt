00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.730
 And then everyone here is Tony. 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.680
 now I'm back here bringing another 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.210
 game play so for you guys 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.090
 This time it was a way I got 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.750
 underground and playing that as I 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.739
 I was with the radio with red dot 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.020
 silencer 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.940
 prices do not want to sell them. 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.360
 So and marketing and follow play I 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.579
 I caught occasionally I did not go by 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.609
 today this Friday that this video to 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.760
 scene or fado and I got kind of 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.159
 wrong was a call on skype 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.769
 with my friends that we were 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.289
 doing there sting on the black ops 2 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.969
 in the hayashi channel and after it's over 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.640
 the time we exchanged ideas 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.000
 Christmas and today I started playing the cup. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.140
 throwing the towel so much that I do not 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.229
 ps 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.270
 the full gameplay because when 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.670
 I started when I got on the map. 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.820
 The game was already in progress and my father 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.730
 called me and I had to answer and I 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.290
 I was like 3 minutes 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:29.510
 died I think about four times 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.160
 I do not remember well I did not die seven times I 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.920
 had died since I had been 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.630
 stopped in that time all that now 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 I remembered the coffee I do not think 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 died and seven times and playing totally 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.360
 just so the students in Paris in no one 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.130
 My team I think had one or two 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.640
 people with and vicky occasionally 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.010
 appeared in the air and I died 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 I 'm going to die will not be almost died 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.030
 several times there trying to get the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.950
 I think I think I did like it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.780
 to try to play and play to catch 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 coins just as I said on the first map 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.220
 For you, I usually play for 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.860
 to pick up mode liked to play the assault 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.970
 but I've been playing specialist now and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.129
 I saw that even it is easy depends on the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.430
 team you play against looks there almost 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.110
 I died but I still managed to escape. 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.080
 I found the guy but managed to get away from him. 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.220
 but coming back and after you handle 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.100
 kind of ethics 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.250
 It's very easy that you do not become mortal anymore. 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.680
 Pimp helps, even with equal to 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 to make a robbery was half way where 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.050
 I like russcha, I do not like it very much. 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 stopped then he was trying not to pull 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.400
 pull but I did not stand in one place 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.940
 I always tried to die 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.970
 new 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.010
 I was always looking for the enemies in the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.690
 they hoped they would come and have friends back 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.500
 of them and the stop happens is I do not know if 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.600
 I tell you that it's epic to be ugly in the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.480
 end'll let it go all the way to 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.010
 You see there you comment there that you 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.580
 They think it was an ugly one. 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.440
 I think it was was vacillating, my I was 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.040
 on the call with the guys I had 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.690
 I talked to them before and I even talked to them. 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.780
 for a little lack to get the way here 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.080
 playing exchanging ideas with them and me 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.180
 I took a flower got caught rj fla 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.430
 you have to try to get a 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.650
 terminal habit such I downloaded today from 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.060
 I used the terminal but I downloaded it yesterday 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.310
 It still has not dropped for me to play. 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.670
 Until now I'm not in a hurry to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.560
 play I played this very number 2 map 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.550
 I'm not in too much of a hurry to 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 play at the time the game fell and then 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.340
 I joined the oab I did not get the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.290
 people change their mind when it comes to the end 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.070
 I'll get to you soon enough. 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.440
 hour 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.670
 Look, I'm trying to get the pec scheme . 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.670
 of the floor without catching the tag but ugly too 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.900
 And now I think I'm missing a little now. 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.989
 I leave now 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.109
 was one of those guys now that the team 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:23.210
 showed and was not down there now it was 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.110
 at the time I saw my face I was watching 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.760
 who have fixed the game is very tight and 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.820
 I think you get a better way 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.160
 lost the itaÃº move you get the mode but 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.099
 Lost the map to me, it's not long ago. 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.740
 and I was looking at the business. 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.320
 that's when I went to see myself I went to pick up 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.910
 the tag when I remembered 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.580
 the radio in my hand did not forget to 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.140
