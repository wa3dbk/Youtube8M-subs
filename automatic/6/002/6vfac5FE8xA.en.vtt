I'm gonna grab a little piece of some
hairs<00:00:57.530> icedove<00:00:58.530> here<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:03.780> will<00:01:03.960> build<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
hairs icedove here and we will build a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.130 
hairs icedove here and we will build a
little<00:01:05.129> segment<00:01:06.740> dubbing<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
little segment dubbing in the back and I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.949 
little segment dubbing in the back and I
will<00:01:13.289> dub<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.579> about<00:01:14.819> the<00:01:15.240> hook<00:01:15.420> point<00:01:15.689> here

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
will dub up to about the hook point here

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.279 
will dub up to about the hook point here
I've<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.709> a<00:01:16.950> piece<00:01:17.249> of<00:01:17.429> foam<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.149> that<00:01:19.109> I've

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
I've got a piece of foam here that I've

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.160 
I've got a piece of foam here that I've
pre-cut<00:01:19.709> you<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.700> there's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.969> taper<00:01:21.179> taper<00:01:21.899> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pre-cut you see there's a taper taper to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.330 
pre-cut you see there's a taper taper to
the<00:01:22.289> back<00:01:22.499> a<00:01:22.950> small<00:01:23.639> taper<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> front<00:01:25.340> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the back a small taper at the front you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
the back a small taper at the front you
can<00:01:26.369> always<00:01:26.639> just<00:01:26.850> tie<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.659> piece<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> foam

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
can always just tie in a piece of foam

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
can always just tie in a piece of foam
here<00:01:28.499> and<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.829> back<00:01:28.859> cut<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.459> later<00:01:29.639> so<00:01:30.200> we're

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
here and go back cut it later so we're

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.769 
here and go back cut it later so we're
gonna<00:01:31.289> set<00:01:31.529> that<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.889> front<00:01:32.600> I'll<00:01:33.600> show

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:33.779 
gonna set that on the front I'll show

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.690 
gonna set that on the front I'll show
you<00:01:33.869> from<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.109> bottom<00:01:34.499> Lingle<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.459> I<00:01:35.490> lay

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you from the bottom Lingle when I lay

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.889 
you from the bottom Lingle when I lay
this<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.119> want<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> centered<00:01:37.289> on<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.709> hook

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
this on I want it centered on the hook

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.169 
this on I want it centered on the hook
so<00:01:39.899> just<00:01:40.349> eyeball<00:01:40.709> that<00:01:40.889> I'm<00:01:41.819> gonna<00:01:41.969> begin

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
so just eyeball that I'm gonna begin

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.830 
so just eyeball that I'm gonna begin
wrapping<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.929> thread<00:01:42.959> over<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> top<00:01:43.859> of<00:01:43.889> it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
wrapping the thread over the top of it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
wrapping the thread over the top of it
the<00:01:45.840> trick<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.109> putting<00:01:46.469> foam<00:01:47.039> on<00:01:47.219> the<00:01:47.310> hook

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the trick to putting foam on the hook

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.269 
the trick to putting foam on the hook
with<00:01:47.819> heavy<00:01:48.420> thread<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.079> don't<00:01:49.829> crank<00:01:50.099> down

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
with heavy thread is don't crank down

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.719 
with heavy thread is don't crank down
too<00:01:50.549> fast<00:01:50.899> at<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.109> beginning<00:01:52.229> turn<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.219> on<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
too fast at the beginning turn it on you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.149 
too fast at the beginning turn it on you
want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.999> gradually<00:01:55.729> tighten<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:58.049> tension

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
want to gradually tighten up the tension

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.340 
want to gradually tighten up the tension
if<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:00.670> do<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.909> too<00:02:01.240> fast<00:02:01.270> at<00:02:01.780> first<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.170> lot<00:02:02.290> of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
if you do it too fast at first a lot of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.969 
if you do it too fast at first a lot of
times<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.710> cup<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.549> foam<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.830> can

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
times you a cup of the foam so you can

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.660 
times you a cup of the foam so you can
get<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> lot<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.640> wraps<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.150> there<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:09.429> from

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
get a lot of wraps on there I do from

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
get a lot of wraps on there I do from
there<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.209> build<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.080> small<00:02:11.530> base<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:13.750> set<00:02:13.989> some

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
there is build a small base to set some

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.680 
there is build a small base to set some
legs<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.819> wrap<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.540> wrap

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
legs in so I will wrap you can wrap

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.420 
legs in so I will wrap you can wrap
forward<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.680> right<00:02:17.830> back

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
forward your right back

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.990 
forward your right back
just<00:02:18.640> build<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> small<00:02:19.300> thread<00:02:19.720> base<00:02:19.959> here<00:02:20.290> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
just build the small thread base here I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750 
just build the small thread base here I
will<00:02:22.000> put<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.420> set<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.380> legs<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.069> side<00:02:24.340> away

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
will put in set of legs on the side away

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.979 
will put in set of legs on the side away
from<00:02:25.030> me<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.770> will<00:02:29.980> put<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.580> set<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.090> legs

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.580 

towards<00:02:34.989> me

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.220 

so<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.489> will<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:40.730> an<00:02:40.880> X<00:02:41.300> like<00:02:41.630> pattern<00:02:42.050> with

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
so you will have an X like pattern with

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.180 
so you will have an X like pattern with
the<00:02:42.349> legs<00:02:45.370> some<00:02:46.370> more<00:02:46.640> dubbing<00:02:47.360> here<00:02:48.190> this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the legs some more dubbing here this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.680 
the legs some more dubbing here this
time<00:02:49.370> we're<00:02:49.520> gonna<00:02:49.580> use<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> fair<00:02:50.510> amount

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
time we're gonna use it a fair amount

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:01.630 
time we're gonna use it a fair amount
more<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:59.470> then<00:03:00.470> take<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> couple<00:03:00.980> wraps<00:03:01.340> in
