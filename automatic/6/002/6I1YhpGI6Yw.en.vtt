00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
that the European Union isn't popular

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.690 
that the European Union isn't popular
amongst<00:01:21.380> our<00:01:21.530> electorate<00:01:21.829> that<00:01:22.100> there<00:01:22.640> are

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
amongst our electorate that there are

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.099 
amongst our electorate that there are
many<00:01:22.880> issues<00:01:23.060> about<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.630> way<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109 
many issues about the way in which the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.510 
many issues about the way in which the
EU<00:01:24.350> has<00:01:24.469> run<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.740> way<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.039> UK<00:01:25.369> government

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
EU has run the way the UK government

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.190 
EU has run the way the UK government
operates<00:01:26.030> which<00:01:26.179> gives<00:01:26.420> rise<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.630> doubts<00:01:26.990> in

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
the electorate and I don't think the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.819 
the electorate and I don't think the

full-blown but the measure the question
why<00:01:40.729> we<00:01:40.909> lost<00:01:41.149> they<00:01:41.299> argue<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.659> question<00:01:41.990> is

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
why we lost they argue the question is

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.690 
why we lost they argue the question is
whether<00:01:42.200> that's<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.499> realistic<00:01:42.770> alternative
