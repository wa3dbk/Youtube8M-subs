00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
I got the biggest shock of my life when

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.360 
I got the biggest shock of my life when
I<00:00:49.270> started<00:00:49.660> working<00:00:49.840> on<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.110> roller<00:00:51.010> tiller

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
I started working on this roller tiller

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.700 
I started working on this roller tiller
I<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:54.250> pulled<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.820> pool<00:00:55.780> cover<00:00:56.019> off<00:00:56.199> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
I just pulled the pool cover off and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:06.870 
I just pulled the pool cover off and
started<00:00:57.250> Rico<00:00:57.850> cover<00:00:58.120> off<00:00:58.239> and<00:01:05.310> that<00:01:06.310> stuff<00:01:06.640> is

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
started Rico cover off and that stuff is

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.039 
started Rico cover off and that stuff is
mangled<00:01:07.450> I'm<00:01:08.220> hoping<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.520> can<00:01:10.030> salvage<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.780> with

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
mangled I'm hoping I can salvage it with

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.050 
mangled I'm hoping I can salvage it with
cleaning<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.830> maybe<00:01:11.950> Sameera<00:01:12.280> muriatic<00:01:12.970> acid

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
cleaning and maybe Sameera muriatic acid

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.190 
cleaning and maybe Sameera muriatic acid
or<00:01:13.540> something<00:01:15.510> I'll<00:01:16.510> have<00:01:16.659> to<00:01:16.810> see<00:01:16.960> about<00:01:17.049> that

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
or something I'll have to see about that

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.490 
or something I'll have to see about that
now<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.040> biggest<00:01:18.310> shock<00:01:18.729> I<00:01:19.150> am<00:01:20.049> pulled<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
now the biggest shock I am pulled the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.250 
now the biggest shock I am pulled the
flywheel<00:01:21.369> off<00:01:21.520> here<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.060> already<00:01:22.299> already

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
flywheel off here it's already already

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.870 
flywheel off here it's already already
loose<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:23.799> just<00:01:24.520> pull<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.479> off<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:26.640> decided<00:01:27.640> to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
loose so just pull that off I decided to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.260 
loose so just pull that off I decided to
try<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.479> check<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.720> points<00:01:29.110> now<00:01:30.240> bear<00:01:31.240> in

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
try and check the points now bear in

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.060 
try and check the points now bear in
mind<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.570> has<00:01:31.780> been<00:01:31.960> stored<00:01:32.260> outside

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
mind this has been stored outside

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.400 
mind this has been stored outside
without<00:01:33.610> used<00:01:34.060> for<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.330> least<00:01:34.630> four<00:01:35.140> years<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
without used for at least four years and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.260 
without used for at least four years and
as<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:38.470> can<00:01:38.680> see<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.370> some<00:01:39.700> grease<00:01:40.000> and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
as you can see it's just some grease and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.000 
as you can see it's just some grease and
oil<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.870> then<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.950> comes<00:01:42.160> off<00:01:42.310> pretty<00:01:42.340> shiny

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
oil and then it comes off pretty shiny

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.290 
oil and then it comes off pretty shiny
but<00:01:45.010> when<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.220> pulled<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.580> cover<00:01:45.790> off<00:01:45.940> for<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
but when I pulled the cover off for the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.910 
but when I pulled the cover off for the
points<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:48.010> what<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.220> found<00:01:48.400> now<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
points this is what I found now it's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.360 
points this is what I found now it's
pretty<00:01:54.160> incredible<00:01:58.800> this<00:01:59.800> has<00:01:59.950> been<00:02:00.100> stored

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
pretty incredible this has been stored

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.730 
pretty incredible this has been stored
outside<00:02:01.050> without<00:02:02.050> protection<00:02:03.900> for<00:02:04.900> at<00:02:05.560> least

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
outside without protection for at least

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.490 
outside without protection for at least
four<00:02:06.070> years<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.270> coil<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.840> everything

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
four years now the coil and everything

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.170 
four years now the coil and everything
is<00:02:08.649> very<00:02:08.950> rusty<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.790> believe<00:02:16.030> those

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
is very rusty and I really believe those

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.720 
is very rusty and I really believe those
points<00:02:16.599> are<00:02:16.750> salvageable<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:18.459> hope<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.700> can

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
points are salvageable I just hope I can

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.110 
points are salvageable I just hope I can
salvage<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.360> piston<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.780> cylinder<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
salvage the piston and cylinder the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780

flywheel<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:22.780> well

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.040 

with<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> fair<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.239> cleaning<00:02:27.510> Angus<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.900> can

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
with a fair bit of cleaning Angus I can

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.589 
with a fair bit of cleaning Angus I can
make<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> work<00:02:28.739> but<00:02:28.890> still<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:30.209> just<00:02:30.450> so

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.410 
make that work but still I was just so
shocked<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.349> those<00:02:31.530> points<00:02:35.150> sort<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.239> hard

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
shocked to see those points sort of hard

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.880 
shocked to see those points sort of hard
to<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.900> some<00:02:37.080> real<00:02:37.230> focus<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> anyways

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
to get some real focus here so anyways

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
to get some real focus here so anyways
the<00:02:44.430> big<00:02:44.640> problem<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.569> think<00:02:45.690> is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the big problem with this one I think is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.559 
the big problem with this one I think is
the<00:02:46.260> cylinder<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.250> looks<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.790> jammed

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the cylinder it looks like it's jammed

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.860 
the cylinder it looks like it's jammed
full<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.489> don't<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.550> what<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.880> but

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870

gonna<00:02:57.900> try<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.290> take<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.560> all<00:02:58.769> off<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.100> one

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
gonna try and take it all off in one
