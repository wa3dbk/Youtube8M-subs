00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.339
 from under them and ace of hearts get any card 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.669
 from the deck can be any of our case 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:35.600
 these are 4 kings now we lay them in 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.320
 special order is like we have 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.390
 black red black put them off 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.980
 turn it over and put it in to the workers for 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.880
 edge working and now we are all 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:12.020
 must decompose kings here workers we 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 remove to the side and now decompose 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.880
 pack into several pieces 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.970

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 spread out on the king for each pile 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 the first king is red 2 black and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.790

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.750
 take the first pile and the king 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.460

 snow a couple of times now we have to 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.870
 shuffle one pile with another we 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.540
 we can ask the viewer to specify which 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.550
 piles with which to shuffle but now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.550
 I will do it on my own 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.770
 and then half a deck on the floor 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.990
 all now see we take a deck and 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.320
 take a randomly chosen map for example 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.800
 Ace we put here and further to find 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.330
