I<00:00:15.570> remember<00:00:15.960> having<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.830> nail<00:00:17.039> polishes

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I remember having little nail polishes

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
I remember having little nail polishes
similar<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> kid<00:00:18.990> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
similar to this when I was a kid that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.310 
similar to this when I was a kid that
you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.300> paint<00:00:21.300> your<00:00:21.359> nails<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.020> peel

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you can paint your nails and then peel

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.009 
you can paint your nails and then peel
the<00:00:23.070> Polish<00:00:23.820> right<00:00:24.090> off<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.779> go

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the Polish right off so we're gonna go

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.180 
the Polish right off so we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.650> into<00:00:25.710> it

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:01:14.610 

you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.540 

and<00:01:15.620> now<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> think<00:01:16.040> they're<00:01:16.460> thinking<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:19.490> you

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
and now I think they're thinking so you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.219 
and now I think they're thinking so you
can<00:01:19.790> see<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.210> they're<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> little<00:01:20.660> bit<00:01:20.900> chunky

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
can see that they're a little bit chunky

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.310 
can see that they're a little bit chunky
but<00:01:21.740> for<00:01:22.250> kids<00:01:22.400> polishes<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.479> think<00:01:24.170> it's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
but for kids polishes I think it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.750 
but for kids polishes I think it's
really<00:01:24.680> cool<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:27.170> on<00:01:27.860> her<00:01:28.070> nails<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.460> really

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
really cool and on her nails you really

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:48.330 
really cool and on her nails you really
can't<00:01:29.000> see<00:01:29.270> how<00:01:30.110> chunky<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.740> or<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.899 

so<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.909> Boko<00:01:50.360> nail-polish<00:01:50.930> and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
so that's the Boko nail-polish and

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.980 
so that's the Boko nail-polish and
they're<00:01:52.909> pretty<00:01:53.150> cool<00:01:53.360> because<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.750> peel

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
they're pretty cool because they peel

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.200 
they're pretty cool because they peel
off<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.670> Allison<00:01:55.670> what<00:01:55.759> do<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.880> think<00:01:56.030> about
