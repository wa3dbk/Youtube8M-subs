00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.150
 [Music] 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.549
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.360
 [Music] 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.949
 dieudonné had been very clear he 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.900
 told me listen you will be the director 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.020
 insurance and an exposed position 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.100
 it's dangerous I'm counting on you because 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.230
 that you have strong shoulders 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.490
 it is clear that it is dangerous to leave 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.110
 when you start to have to manage 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 millions of euros that are used 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.010
 against the system 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.859
 we are a target that's normal so 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.329
 Obviously there is a salary that goes with 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.739
 in my family situation you have to be 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.719
 it must be known one thing is that I 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.030
 am the only one who can work my 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.940
 girl requires a lot of care 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.409
 my wife devote herself entirely and 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.800
 I welcome it and I do not want it 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.269
 exchange 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.170
 I think it's the role of a 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.179
 family to be there to help his child 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.530
 and then I do not have to dwell on 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.909
 the question because my goal is not 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.549
 to shed tears in the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.559
 homes my family is such that she is 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.089
 and that does not finally look at anyone 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.320
 I'm the only one who has to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.100
 able to work so the only one to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.530
 to be able to go back healthy saleh and he was 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.850
 agreed with given that here it is 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.620
 was going to offer me a salary that was going 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.080
 to help my family live but 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.420
 also to finance my fighting fights 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.390
 political fight with standing belgians 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.830
 etc., etc 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.340
 dieudonné had always been clear if 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.560
 this 8000 euros per month a housing 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 etc., etc 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.400
 he has the right to propose what he wants in 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.060
 anyway that's what made me like 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.770
 proposal after noemi came back on 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.689
 the promises of giving and obviously 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 all that I was offered his 2000 euros 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.850
 per month and a caravan a mobile home 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.890
 if you want me for me it's still 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
 always a house that moves that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.399
 it is a caravan or a mobile home at 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.840
 I do not want to live in a mobile 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.920
 home it's my right I mean everyone 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.060
 does what he wants and it's not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.869
 data that will still say where I have to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 inhabited so I'm tall I'm I 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.229
 am I am an adult so it's still 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.229
 who choose where I live
