00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.299 
style we have this very same art style a
few<00:00:53.170> issues<00:00:53.350> who<00:00:53.649> I<00:00:53.679> think<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.039> was<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:54.280> a

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
few issues who I think it was like a

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.889 
few issues who I think it was like a
round<00:00:54.670> issue<00:00:54.909> 10<00:00:55.329> or<00:00:55.449> something<00:00:55.719> like<00:00:55.839> that

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
round issue 10 or something like that

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.689 
round issue 10 or something like that
and<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.530> was<00:00:56.620> when<00:00:56.800> Pizza<00:00:57.129> was<00:00:57.280> having<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.519> dream

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
and it was when Pizza was having a dream

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.279 
and it was when Pizza was having a dream
about<00:00:57.819> his<00:00:58.059> Uncle<00:00:58.300> Ben<00:00:58.510> being<00:00:58.749> murdered<00:00:58.989> and

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
about his Uncle Ben being murdered and

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.319 
about his Uncle Ben being murdered and
cept<00:00:59.769> this<00:00:59.920> time<00:01:00.190> it's<00:01:00.399> about<00:01:00.489> him<00:01:00.789> wearing

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
cept this time it's about him wearing

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.299 
cept this time it's about him wearing
the<00:01:01.510> Venom<00:01:01.899> symbiote<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.499> of<00:01:02.800> course<00:01:03.010> nearly

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
the Venom symbiote and of course nearly

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.280 
the Venom symbiote and of course nearly
killing<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.909> criminal<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.870> actually

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
killing this criminal it's actually

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.630 
killing this criminal it's actually
really<00:01:05.500> interesting<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:06.159> me<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.280> they<00:01:06.550> can

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
really interesting to me that they can

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.760 
really interesting to me that they can
actually<00:01:06.820> no<00:01:07.420> rate<00:01:07.690> through<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.229> look<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
actually no rate through the look of the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.650 
actually no rate through the look of the
art<00:01:08.920> style<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.490> obviously<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.360> know<00:01:10.480> it's<00:01:10.600> a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
art style so obviously we know it's a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.180 
art style so obviously we know it's a
dream<00:01:10.930> sequence<00:01:11.140> because<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.650> art<00:01:11.800> style<00:01:12.100> is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
dream sequence because the art style is

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.040 
dream sequence because the art style is
a<00:01:12.250> little<00:01:12.550> bit<00:01:12.670> more<00:01:13.000> like<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.240> metallic<00:01:13.690> look

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
a little bit more like a metallic look

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.780 
a little bit more like a metallic look
it<00:01:14.290> looks<00:01:14.740> very<00:01:14.980> much<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.490> ultimate

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
it looks very much like the ultimate

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.700 
it looks very much like the ultimate
spider-man<00:01:16.060> comic<00:01:16.450> book<00:01:16.570> front<00:01:16.900> cover<00:01:17.320> which

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
spider-man comic book front cover which

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.860 
spider-man comic book front cover which
is<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> very<00:01:18.160> refreshing<00:01:18.580> change<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:19.390> art<00:01:19.540> style

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
is a very refreshing change of art style

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.230 
is a very refreshing change of art style
in<00:01:19.990> my<00:01:20.110> opinion<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:21.040> we<00:01:21.160> can<00:01:21.280> see<00:01:21.460> Peter<00:01:21.700> waking

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
in my opinion so we can see Peter waking

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.150 
in my opinion so we can see Peter waking
up<00:01:22.330> out<00:01:22.510> of<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:22.840> nightmare<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.830> course

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
up out of this nightmare and of course

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.980 
up out of this nightmare and of course
the<00:01:24.280> only<00:01:24.460> person<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:25.000> feels<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.510> can<00:01:25.660> truly

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
the only person I feels that I can truly

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.680 
the only person I feels that I can truly
talk<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.620> is<00:01:26.740> Mary<00:01:26.980> Jane<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.880> pizza<00:01:28.210> actually

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
talk to is Mary Jane so pizza actually

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.360 
talk to is Mary Jane so pizza actually
wakes<00:01:28.960> up<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.320> heads<00:01:29.560> over<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.920> Mary<00:01:30.070> Jane's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
house wakes her up by banging on a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.160 
house wakes her up by banging on a

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
crucial part of the comic in my opinion

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.210 
crucial part of the comic in my opinion
because<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.739> forget<00:02:31.890> about

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
Mary Jane and that is why nothing is

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.660 
Mary Jane and that is why nothing is
ever<00:02:52.379> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.739> happen<00:02:52.920> between<00:02:53.069> him<00:02:53.519> and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
ever going to happen between him and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.150 
ever going to happen between him and
Gwen<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.569> honestly<00:02:54.690> believe<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
Gwen and I honestly believe that this is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.190 
Gwen and I honestly believe that this is
the<00:02:56.310> perfect<00:02:56.579> time<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.000> actually<00:02:57.420> say<00:02:57.959> this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
the perfect time to actually say this

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720 
the perfect time to actually say this
and<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.920> writer<00:02:59.160> Brian<00:02:59.579> Michael

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
and I think the writer Brian Michael

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.250 
and I think the writer Brian Michael
Bendis<00:03:00.060> knows<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.450> as<00:03:00.569> well<00:03:00.750> because<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
Bendis knows this as well because if you

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
Bendis knows this as well because if you
think<00:03:01.500> about<00:03:01.590> where<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.099> late<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:02.940> night

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
think about where it's late at night

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.539 
think about where it's late at night
it's<00:03:03.510> raining<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.290> stormy<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.340> think

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it's raining it's stormy and I think

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.430 
it's raining it's stormy and I think
it's<00:03:05.700> actually<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.090> given<00:03:06.510> fact<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.140> people

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
it's actually a given fact that people

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080 
it's actually a given fact that people
tend<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.769> open<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.129> about<00:03:08.250> their<00:03:08.489> emotions<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090

to Eddie who has been devoured by the
Venom<00:03:48.840> symbiote<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.349> someone<00:03:50.010> actually

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
Venom symbiote and someone actually

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.050 
Venom symbiote and someone actually
finds<00:03:50.639> Eddie

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
finds Eddie

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.789 
finds Eddie
stuck<00:03:51.629> in<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> symbiote<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.319> actually<00:03:52.590> wants

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
stuck in the symbiote and actually wants

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.559 
stuck in the symbiote and actually wants
to<00:03:52.919> help<00:03:53.160> him<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:54.030> isn't<00:03:54.480> actually

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.539 
to help him and it isn't actually
looking<00:03:55.079> too<00:03:55.230> good<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.040> think<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.400> just

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
looking too good and I think it's just

one<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.819> those<00:03:56.910> things<00:03:57.209> we're<00:03:57.419> in<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.720> wrong

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
place at the wrong time and this person

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.789 
place at the wrong time and this person
who's<00:04:00.299> trying<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.569> help<00:04:00.750> him<00:04:00.959> actually<00:04:01.379> goes

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
who's trying to help him actually goes

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.159 
who's trying to help him actually goes
to<00:04:01.829> touch<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.489> symbiote<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:03.989> he

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169

vows him it just takes him and it's
looking<00:04:06.870> pretty<00:04:07.139> promising<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:07.769> Eddie<00:04:07.949> is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
looking pretty promising that Eddie is

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.039 
looking pretty promising that Eddie is
probably<00:04:08.430> killed<00:04:08.699> this<00:04:08.849> person<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.510> already

probably killed this person so already
Eddie<00:04:10.260> hasn't<00:04:10.500> had<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.859> symbiote<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.430> two

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
Eddie hasn't had the symbiote for two

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.460 
Eddie hasn't had the symbiote for two
seconds<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.269> he's<00:04:12.359> already<00:04:12.840> caused<00:04:13.169> someone

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
seconds and he's already caused someone

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.650 
seconds and he's already caused someone
else<00:04:13.680> harm<00:04:14.069> now<00:04:14.549> we<00:04:14.609> flick<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.120> over<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.449> page

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
else harm now we flick on over the page

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.360 
else harm now we flick on over the page
and<00:04:15.930> we<00:04:15.989> go<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.169> Eddie<00:04:16.440> struggling<00:04:17.099> to<00:04:17.220> hold

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and we go to Eddie struggling to hold

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.339 
and we go to Eddie struggling to hold
the<00:04:17.549> symbiote<00:04:17.910> together<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.660> feels<00:04:18.959> like<00:04:19.109> it's

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
the symbiote together it feels like it's

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.930 
the symbiote together it feels like it's
eating<00:04:19.590> any<00:04:19.919> feels<00:04:20.160> like<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:20.609> taking

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
eating any feels like that it's taking

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.620 
eating any feels like that it's taking
over<00:04:21.030> his<00:04:21.209> body

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
over his body

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.420 
over his body
but<00:04:21.989> he's<00:04:22.229> trying<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:22.680> about<00:04:22.860> Peter<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
but he's trying to think about Peter and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.459 
but he's trying to think about Peter and
how<00:04:23.669> he<00:04:23.729> did<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.389> that's<00:04:25.020> giving<00:04:25.380> him

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
how he did it and that's giving him

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.740 
how he did it and that's giving him
confidence<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.280> he<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.610> also<00:04:26.849> control<00:04:27.479> this

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
confidence that he can also control this

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.570 
confidence that he can also control this
something<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.560> actually<00:04:28.950> made<00:04:29.099> me<00:04:29.130> luck

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
something that actually made me luck

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.900 
something that actually made me luck
quite<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.030> lot<00:04:30.300> when<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.479> was<00:04:30.630> read

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
quite a lot when I was read

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.520 
quite a lot when I was read
this<00:04:31.120> was<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.420> part<00:04:31.630> where<00:04:31.780> Eddie<00:04:31.990> says<00:04:32.320> I'll

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
this was the part where Eddie says I'll

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.900 
this was the part where Eddie says I'll
kill<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:33.040> Peter<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.430> then<00:04:33.670> all<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.880> sudden

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
kill you Peter and then all of a sudden

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.420 
kill you Peter and then all of a sudden
he<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.270> says<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:35.080> frisbee<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.980> obviously

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
he just says my frisbee now obviously

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.730 
he just says my frisbee now obviously
that's<00:04:36.640> going<00:04:36.970> back<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.210> when<00:04:38.170> Peter<00:04:38.560> and

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that's going back to when Peter and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.500 
that's going back to when Peter and
Eddie<00:04:38.890> were<00:04:39.040> kids<00:04:39.280> under<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.700> frisbee<00:04:40.030> agile<00:04:40.450> a

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
Eddie were kids under a frisbee agile a

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.780 
Eddie were kids under a frisbee agile a
hit<00:04:40.720> Peter<00:04:40.960> in<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.650> side<00:04:41.890> of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.100> head<00:04:42.310> but<00:04:42.730> I

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
hit Peter in the side of the head but I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.580 
hit Peter in the side of the head but I
just<00:04:43.030> felt<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.300> was<00:04:43.390> incredibly<00:04:43.930> random<00:04:44.440> for

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
just felt that was incredibly random for

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.610 
just felt that was incredibly random for
Eddie<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> just<00:04:45.160> think<00:04:45.700> oh<00:04:45.910> my<00:04:46.540> frisbee<00:04:46.960> mid

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
Eddie to just think oh my frisbee mid

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.350 
Eddie to just think oh my frisbee mid
thinking<00:04:48.100> about<00:04:48.280> killing<00:04:48.520> Peter<00:04:48.850> Parker

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
thinking about killing Peter Parker

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.000 
thinking about killing Peter Parker
I<00:04:49.390> suppose<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.110> also<00:04:50.260> suggests<00:04:50.920> that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
I suppose that it also suggests that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.920 
I suppose that it also suggests that
maybe<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.400> symbiote<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.970> some<00:04:52.210> kind<00:04:52.480> of<00:04:52.600> drug

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
maybe the symbiote is some kind of drug

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.450 
maybe the symbiote is some kind of drug
like<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.260> messes<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:53.680> your<00:04:53.890> mind<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.280> really

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
like it messes with your mind it really

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.460 
like it messes with your mind it really
messes<00:04:55.090> up<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.480> inner<00:04:55.690> workings<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.410> your

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
messes up the inner workings of your

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.560 
messes up the inner workings of your
brain<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.490> doesn't<00:04:58.060> make<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.330> see

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
brain and just doesn't make you see

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.180 
brain and just doesn't make you see
straight<00:04:58.900> at<00:04:59.020> all<00:04:59.200> now<00:04:59.650> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.920> see<00:05:00.100> on

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
straight at all now you can see on
