00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 because several people have 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.000
 asked how is he painting me 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 purple or light purple hair 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 so I decided to make this video for 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.340
 make a count of the procedure 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.619
 that I use mostly because although 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 I know there are many videos on the internet and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.560
 many tutorials this is not always 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.430
 it works because we do not find the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 products that are mentioned and I know my 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 own recipe could be said with 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 products that I found here in tijuana 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.399
 the dax store or worse and supplies that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 there is around here and I think that the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 results were very good 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.140
 Now I have a super color 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 tax-exempt 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.740
 yellow and some pieces 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.900
 the purple ones but well I'm going to give 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.060
 one so you have 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.300
 the discoloration and we're going to see that 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.300
 as well 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.440
 The first thing we are going to use is 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.680
 products to decorate the hair yo 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
 I use the dust and draft of these 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.570
 encounters in any glass supply 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.090
 that goes between 35 and 40 pesos after 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.050
 we're going to need peroxide in cream and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.280
 I use this one that are intact 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.820
 comes a presentation also more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.820
 little girl 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.659
 and then it's 20 volumes of the shot are 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.990
 stronger 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.609
 I also dye and use the lowey brand 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.649
 that you also find in dax and it's very 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.649
 economic has the tubes 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:38.070
 and then happened to need conditioner 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 I have done I am using it 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240
 the prayer of Jesus 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:50.020
 and also your container where you go to 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.079
 mix it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.539
 peroxide and then his little stick in some 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.329
 occasion he says use this they sell in 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.340
 give and give it I do not recommend it I did not like it 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.920
 the result so much that with him so 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 It is definitely better to use ida in 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.289
 peroxide I would also like to use 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.289
 hydra but it has worked well 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.180
 and well the first thing we are going to do is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.440
 mix our peroxide in cream with the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.440
 color to dye so let's go to the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.350
 times in our next while 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.960
 that there are some measures 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.600
 they say so many grams of that how many 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.960
 milliliters of the other request at least I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 it does not work like that, what I do is that 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.219
 I'm getting more or less 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.870
 the amount of each other until 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.969
 I consider that the mixture of enzymes 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.250
 adequate and very thick or very liquid 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.530
 so I guess that does not help 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.560
 to the base of the experience but if you 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.989
 you have never tried you can review 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.180
 to and do a search on the internet and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.780
 surely you will find some table of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.200
 enap of good proportions and this is the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.959
 final mix that I'm going to use for 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 Apply directly on my hair 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.410
 we go with the next step 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.540
 the first thing you have to be 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.599
 exceptional the hair that you are going to 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.130
 discolor and the rest move it feels 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.640
 some movement reacted to the part 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.010
 I'm going to paint but I already brought it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.910
 of color what I do decide in my 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.110
 make extra hair 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.810
 then start 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
 in the root if it comes first enjoy 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.150
 blue color hair recommended that the 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.660
 red root until the last because it is the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.110
 part that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.069
 where you get faster results 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.049
 and so briefly the rich 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.600
 applied on one side since he has pleaded 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.440
 divide 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.990
 but no 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.590
 you are going to divide and you are going to apply the other 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.200
 side 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.000
 uniformly and so you will continue with 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.250
 all your hair good dressed 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 applied dye you will have something 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.200
 more or less like this families are going to see 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.090
 blonde hair I 'll wait a few 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.070
 minutes and it 's the first time that you 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.010
 you're going to bleach probably you have to 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.519
 wait approximately 30 to 40 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.200
 minutes however, as I already know 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.810
 I have colorado goes and I'm from your 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.850
 party then nothing more to clarify it 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.250
 a little more I'll wait around 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.590
 10 15 minutes and I'm going to remove it 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.290
 that my hair is already damaged by 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.150
 the previous times once that 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.340
 color of your hair and that you go the mother 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.380
 you will have something like that 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.140
 so I stay super yellow which is 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.570
 fabra that you even have my orange and 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.130
 it's normal not always going to be positive 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.940
 a super clear result because it 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.000
 they need enough 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.950
 from Colorado for me this is the fourth 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.590
 if I'm not wrong but possible I had 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.819
 several colors before then first 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.349
 how to get those colors to 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.800
 once we have colors of our 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.469
 hair and as this dries we go to 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.189
 make two months mild of conditioned 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.639
 with purple tint I will apply a 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.069
 little bit more 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.030
 enough let's go measuring I'm going to 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.030
 beat with a little theme 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.169
 and well then once you've 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.439
 bleached your hair this has 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.749
 dried and have this appearance that 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.909
 is super fried with a potato can be 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:52.679
 it's time to put the dye we have 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.679
 mixed with the conditioner 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.900
 let's wait about an hour 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.569
 and then we're going to withdraw we're going to 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.389
 the bathrooms super well and you're going to have the 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.250
 final color then I will do everything 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.420
 this process and good to see how I 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.970
 remains 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.540
 and good of this is the final result 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.490
 I'm very happy that it really is 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.110
 better than last time because in addition 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.510
 parejitos and although there are some 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.720
 still half yellow shades out there 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.580
 mean I think your prized with the 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.310
 following is that less retouching and 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.870
 with shaded or spicy shampoo 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.870
 to solve this 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.190
 I hope you have served them something this 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.510
 brief mini tutorial I did and then if 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.640
 have any doubt or something 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.210
 talking about it and I'll help you in 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.210
 what I can
