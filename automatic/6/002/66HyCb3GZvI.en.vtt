00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
easy to level up how can you complain

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.910 
easy to level up how can you complain
about<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
about that

other week or last week and what it did

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.050 
other week or last week and what it did
was<00:02:36.150> make<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.989> harder<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> level<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.670> not

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
was make it harder to level up not not

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.210 
was make it harder to level up not not
pre-big<00:02:39.630> bang<00:02:39.630> level<00:02:40.410> harder<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.920> level<00:02:41.130> up

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
pre-big bang level harder to level up

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.270 
pre-big bang level harder to level up
but<00:02:41.819> still<00:02:42.209> pretty<00:02:42.480> damn<00:02:42.780> difficult<00:02:43.080> are<00:02:44.069> not

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
but still pretty damn difficult are not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.949 
but still pretty damn difficult are not
difficult<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.480> takes<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
difficult but just it just takes a

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.410 
difficult but just it just takes a
little<00:02:46.200> bit<00:02:46.410> longer<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.220> sucks<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.209> much

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
little bit longer and it sucks so much

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.590 
little bit longer and it sucks so much
because<00:02:49.170> there's<00:02:49.530> no<00:02:49.739> way<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> counter<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.700> you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
because there's no way to counter it you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600 
because there's no way to counter it you
can<00:02:51.750> go<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.140> 2x<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.680> whatnot<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.160> i<00:02:53.370> don't

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
can go for 2x and whatnot but i don't

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.840 
can go for 2x and whatnot but i don't
want<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> pay<00:02:53.819> an<00:02:53.970> axe<00:02:55.340> yeah<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.580> no<00:02:56.730> way

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
want to pay an axe yeah there's no way

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.680 
want to pay an axe yeah there's no way
to<00:02:56.910> counter<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:58.580> once<00:02:59.580> Big<00:02:59.790> Bang<00:02:59.970> came<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.390> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
to counter it once Big Bang came out you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.360 
to counter it once Big Bang came out you
could<00:03:00.870> counter<00:03:01.230> leveling<00:03:01.680> up<00:03:01.769> too<00:03:01.920> fast<00:03:01.950> by

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
could counter leveling up too fast by

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.729 
could counter leveling up too fast by
training<00:03:02.760> somewhere<00:03:03.150> or<00:03:03.330> doing<00:03:04.230> quests<00:03:04.530> or

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
training somewhere or doing quests or

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.949 
training somewhere or doing quests or
something<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.150> you'll<00:03:06.569> level<00:03:06.810> up

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
something like that and you'll level up

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.809 
something like that and you'll level up
a<00:03:07.049> lot<00:03:07.200> slower<00:03:07.380> if<00:03:07.739> that's<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.430> want<00:03:08.670> if

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
a lot slower if that's what you want if

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.789 
a lot slower if that's what you want if
you<00:03:08.850> want<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> challenge<00:03:09.440> for<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.560> reason

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
you want to challenge for some reason

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.309 
you want to challenge for some reason
you<00:03:10.890> find<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> challenge<00:03:12.750> level<00:03:13.260> of

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
you find that to be a challenge level of

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.340 
you find that to be a challenge level of
so<00:03:13.620> slower<00:03:14.310> all<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.390> can<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.660> all<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.110> had<00:03:16.260> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
so slower all you can do all you had to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.460 
so slower all you can do all you had to
do<00:03:16.470> was<00:03:16.910> uh<00:03:17.910> what<00:03:18.269> was<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.810> train<00:03:19.140> somewhere

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
do was uh what was the train somewhere

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.970 
do was uh what was the train somewhere
that<00:03:19.709> gave<00:03:19.890> crappy<00:03:20.269> experience<00:03:21.269> now<00:03:21.989> good

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
that gave crappy experience now good

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.190 
that gave crappy experience now good
experience<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:23.910> given<00:03:24.329> anywhere<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.049> now

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
experience is not given anywhere so now

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.250 
experience is not given anywhere so now
we're<00:03:25.380> stuck<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.420> lazy<00:03:27.420> ass<00:03:27.720> or<00:03:28.049> just
