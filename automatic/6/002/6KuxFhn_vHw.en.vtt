00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.070
 I am black alastor and today I bring you another video which worsened 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.520
 good let's start at once 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.420
 have you ever wondered if the things that are written in the bible 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.129
 Are true 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.939
 Well, I will not tell you yes or no 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.699
 it will only give them 100% real information 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.220
 No tricks or tricks 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.579
 only information 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.579
 then you draw your own conclusions 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 this book is about supposedly miraculous stories that supposedly happened 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.860
 centuries ago when men were easily deceived by smoke and 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.670
 mirrors thanks to your great ignorance 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.150
 the bible has an infinity of stories 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.420
 that even contradict themselves 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 well let's start from the beginning of the bible 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 you sincerely believe that we were created from earth and that the first woman 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.780
 It was created with a rib 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 jajajaj huasca jajajajajaja 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.180
 you believe that a flood killed every living being that did not believe in god 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 except to move threads of his boat 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 if so 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.300
 then as there are nowadays the millions of types of trees and plants 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.050
 what is in the world after this flood 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.250
 yes they were 40 days and 40 nights underwater how the species survived 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.330
 vegetables 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 with that and because it's in the roots 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.909
 or perhaps the trees also dreamed of the flood and grabbed paws and 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.909
 then they got into the boat just like the animals 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.680
 why talk about moses and their mystic super powers 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.300
 this one was quite a character 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.670
 in the bible it also says 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.650
 Jesus is the one sent from God and who sent him to this world to bring love and 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.870
 to save us 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.320
 but then he says that God is a barrier to all 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.200
 with the broom of annihilation and that also completely destroyed this 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.080
 world with the apocalypse 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.360
 perhaps he sent Jesus to earth 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.450
 so that he would do totally the opposite of his will 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.420
 or is it that he regretted saving us after sending us his 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 supposed son 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 what more tests do they want? 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.810
 one more sample than those who wrote the bible 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.000
 more than prophets 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.170
 they were ignorant unemployed who did not even know how to invent 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.809
 some divine interpretations that had more credibility 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:17.039
 as in that time everything was believed any hoax could not be noticed 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.269
 of deceits and fictitious interpretations 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.760
 these are just some of the infinities of contradictions that are 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.679
 you can find in the bible 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.779
 if you want to check it yourself 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.999
 I do not swallow the false stories 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.059
 as for example that jesus is the son of god 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.120
 that multiplied loaves and fish 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.989
 that cleansed the impure and that raised a dead 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.549
 how they come out in those religious films misinterpreted by their 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.649
 producers 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.629
 and you know why I do not think so 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.530
 because the bible is full of metaphors and parables that went wrong 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.760
 interpreted by most people 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.499
 with the passage of time 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.769
 causing that nowadays things are created that did not really happen 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.099
 I came to the conclusion that Jesus was just another prophet 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.119
 just one hand 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.269
 you will ask yourself 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.189
 how I came to this conclusion 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.259
 it's because the ancient Hebrews told him in quotation marks son of god 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.469
 to those who preached the word of jehovah 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.529
 and then they got a lot of followers for it 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.019
 Of course this does not say the Bible for the following two reasons 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.669
 the first and original bible that existed was written in a mixture of 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.169
 Aramaic and ancient Hebrew 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.199
 which caused the mistranslation and interpretation of this 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.180
 in Roman and other languages 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.370
 which generated a series of inconsistencies and versions that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.230
 simply 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.729
 they were not true 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.219
 I will give you an example so that they understand me 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.219
 the word that Jesus was put on the cross 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.979
 means two different things in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.290
 for the convenience of the church itself that manipulated and modified the bible 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.690
 rewriting the in order to achieve profit 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.659
 thanks to the fear they inflicted on people 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.139
 telling them lies 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.169
 like the next if they refuse to give money to the church 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.650
 they will not be able to cleanse their sins and they will be thrown into hell forever 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.359
 at the time of the final judgment 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.849
 obviously as people were ignorant they believed everything and did what 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.910
 who will order the holy church and the holy risi sea bible 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:22.300
 now he explained to them about the metaphors of the bible with a real example 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.330
 when in the bible it says 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.869
 Then Jesus multiplied the bread and the fish to feed his followers 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.460
 this means that while Jesus preached for the towns and cities 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 the believers in him and in God multiplied rapidly 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.179
 do you really believe that the best-selling book in the world does not have 

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.699
 false stories 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.699
 Well, they tell me now after everything I said 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.960
 to see if they understand me with some questions 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.189
 so that they believe me once 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.129
 how many innocent lives were lost to no avail 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.149
 fighting for a simple commonplace in the wars of the Crusades 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.520
 how many people were killed by the church just for having another religion 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.479
 that they called Sinica mente 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.589
 pagan 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.709
 how much money was forced on people to pay the church up to only about 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:13.069
 centuries ago 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.749
 how many people were burned at the stake because of the ignorance of 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.099
 followers of the church 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.449
 how many people died in total for this damn religion 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.469
 just think about it for a moment 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.679
 it is worth thinking fervently about something that has caused so much suffering to the 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:30.650
 humanity 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.039
 and the worst of all is that there are chronically 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.289
 the bible has made people throughout history make almost 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.479
 totally the opposite of what it tries to promote 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.069
 it does not seem weird 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.240
 Well, me too 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.979
 but even weirder it seems to me that in a part of the bible Jesus says 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.099
 I come to bring the light 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.199
 and coincidentally the name of the devil is lucifer 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.319
 what light means 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.529
 that Jesus would bring us to the devil 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.029
 this left me thinking that jesus maybe is not what it appeared to be 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.659
 but something darker and more evil 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.000
 all the information that I gave them 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.340
 I got it myself 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.699
 reading a bible to borrow from a Catholic neighbor and also 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.819
 conversing with experts in the subject 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.819
 I only leave this information to your own criteria 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.539
 judge it as you see fit 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.789
 but before that I only ask you to ask these questions and to answer 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.909
 yourselves sincerely 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.610
 you are willing to take the blindfold and accept the truth of a time 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.979
 or you have to necessarily believe what you think most 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.659
 because that's what you're getting into your head 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.800
 since you were a child 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.199
 the choice is yours 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.219
 I noticed I will impose nothing by force 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.939
 I just ask you to reflect if I see if you're brave enough to admit 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.059
 the truth 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.180
 I do not say that there is no god 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.610
 I say that you believe what you want to believe 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.580
 not what others impose on you 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.349
 I'll let you process all this 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:06:59.139
 until next time
