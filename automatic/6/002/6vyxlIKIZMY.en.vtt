00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.170 
but I never putting the battery up here
this<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:10.979> way<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.580> stable<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> air

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
this thing is way more stable in the air

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.740 
this thing is way more stable in the air
now

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
now

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.660 
now
you<00:02:13.140> still<00:02:13.380> land<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> back<00:02:14.040> every<00:02:14.370> single

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
you still land on the back every single

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.280 
you still land on the back every single
time<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:16.190> got<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.760> electronics<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:19.610> 2055

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
time I got a for electronics just 2055

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.390 
time I got a for electronics just 2055
steering<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.410> throttle<00:02:22.440> servo<00:02:22.890> nothing

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
steering and throttle servo nothing

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.450 
steering and throttle servo nothing
special<00:02:24.200> plastic<00:02:25.200> years<00:02:25.590> they've<00:02:26.310> been

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
special plastic years they've been

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.060 
special plastic years they've been
lasting<00:02:26.940> surprisingly<00:02:27.590> even<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> stock

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
lasting surprisingly even the stock

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.040 
lasting surprisingly even the stock
drive<00:02:29.370> shafts<00:02:29.850> last<00:02:30.090> I'm<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.720> surprised

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
drive shafts last I'm really surprised

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.230 
drive shafts last I'm really surprised
because<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> brushless<00:02:32.730> tracks

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
because when you have a brushless tracks

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.940 
because when you have a brushless tracks
that's<00:02:33.480> nothing<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.930> destroys<00:02:34.380> driveshaft

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that's nothing just destroys driveshaft

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.440 
that's nothing just destroys driveshaft
so<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.250> must<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.770> slower<00:02:38.450> slower

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
so it must be the the slower slower

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.260 
so it must be the the slower slower
torque<00:02:39.840> curve<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> Nitro<00:02:40.620> motor<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.270> just

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
torque curve of the Nitro motor I just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.860 
torque curve of the Nitro motor I just
noticed<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.840> shock<00:02:43.970> shock<00:02:44.970> was<00:02:45.240> been<00:02:45.480> have

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
noticed this shock shock was been have

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.620 
noticed this shock shock was been have
to<00:02:45.990> fix<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:47.270> motors<00:02:48.270> all<00:02:48.420> stock<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:50.600> mean<00:02:51.600> I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
to fix that motors all stock I mean I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.090 
to fix that motors all stock I mean I
could<00:02:51.990> make<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> little<00:02:52.290> bit<00:02:52.500> lighter<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:53.010> I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
could make it a little bit lighter if I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.190 
could make it a little bit lighter if I
wanted<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.580> by<00:02:54.209> putting<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.510> pole<00:02:54.690> star<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
wanted to by putting a pole star but I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.160 
wanted to by putting a pole star but I
hate<00:02:55.890> having<00:02:56.100> yank<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> nitro<00:02:56.910> motor<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
hate having yank on a nitro motor so I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.220 
hate having yank on a nitro motor so I
got<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.410> stock<00:02:58.650> easy<00:02:59.220> start<00:03:01.970> gladiator<00:03:03.230> 2.8

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
got the stock easy start gladiator 2.8

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.260 
got the stock easy start gladiator 2.8
rear<00:03:04.470> tires<00:03:04.770> these<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> most

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
rear tires these are like the most

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.570 
rear tires these are like the most
aggressive<00:03:06.950> tires<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.160> get<00:03:08.430> they're

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
aggressive tires you can get they're

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.699 
aggressive tires you can get they're
still<00:03:09.110> low-profile<00:03:10.110> because<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.470> want<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
still low-profile because I want this

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.350 
still low-profile because I want this
thing<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:11.010> fast<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.490> possible<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.000> handle<00:03:12.270> as

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
thing as fast as possible to handle as

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
thing as fast as possible to handle as
good<00:03:12.480> as<00:03:12.570> possible<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.650> don't<00:03:13.860> really<00:03:13.920> want

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
good as possible so I don't really want

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.250 
good as possible so I don't really want
monster<00:03:14.640> truck<00:03:14.820> tires<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.300> there<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.050> these

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
monster truck tires on there and these

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.640 
monster truck tires on there and these
work<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.530> good<00:03:18.110> that's<00:03:19.110> about<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
work really good that's about it it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.840 
work really good that's about it it
doesn't<00:03:19.830> take<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.070> lot<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.310> upgrades<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.760> make

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
doesn't take a lot of upgrades to make

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.050 
doesn't take a lot of upgrades to make
this<00:03:21.060> thing<00:03:21.769> durable<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.920> stable<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.670> don't

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
this thing durable and stable I don't

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.600 
this thing durable and stable I don't
have<00:03:24.150> many<00:03:24.330> nitros<00:03:24.780> left<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:26.250> keeping

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
have many nitros left but I'm keeping

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.550 
have many nitros left but I'm keeping
this<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:26.760> because<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.900> fun<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
this one because it's just really fun to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.540 
this one because it's just really fun to
jump<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.070> drive<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:30.180> pretty<00:03:30.390> good
