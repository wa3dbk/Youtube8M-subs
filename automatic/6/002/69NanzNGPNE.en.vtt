00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
two combinations I can think of well in

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
two combinations I can think of well in
terms<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> San<00:00:33.210> Francisco<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> gives<00:00:34.050> us<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
terms of San Francisco it gives us a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.700

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
race often and create some pretty

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
race often and create some pretty
awesome<00:00:39.510> visuals<00:00:40.110> reason<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> Frostbite

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
awesome visuals reason the Frostbite

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.770 
awesome visuals reason the Frostbite
engine<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.329> some<00:00:42.510> pretty<00:00:42.690> cool

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
engine so we get to do some pretty cool

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.500 
engine so we get to do some pretty cool
stuff<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> cool<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.160> honorific

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
stuff with the cool like an honorific

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.490 
stuff with the cool like an honorific
iconography<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.719> terms<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
iconography in terms of the the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
iconography in terms of the the
landmarks<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> San<00:00:48.210> Francisco

landmarks that are in San Francisco

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
landmarks that are in San Francisco
that's<00:00:48.719> probably<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> biggest<00:00:49.170> reason<00:00:49.469> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that's probably the biggest reason we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
that's probably the biggest reason we
started<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> terms<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.420> finishing

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
started there and in terms of finishing

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
started there and in terms of finishing
in<00:00:51.870> New<00:00:51.930> York<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.250> city<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
want to finish in on the East Coast like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
want to finish in on the East Coast like
New<00:00:55.860> York<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> center<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> world<00:00:57.090> in

New York is the center of the world in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.630 
New York is the center of the world in
many<00:00:57.510> people's<00:00:57.870> minds<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:59.010> wouldn't<00:00:59.489> we

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
many people's minds so why wouldn't we

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
many people's minds so why wouldn't we
finish<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.329> made<00:01:00.539> sense<00:01:00.750> how

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
finish there it just made sense how

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.080 
finish there it just made sense how
about<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> cities<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.489> between<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.940> did

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
about all the cities in between how did

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
about all the cities in between how did
you<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.329> deciding<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.110> which<00:01:04.589> slices

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you go about deciding which which slices

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
you go about deciding which which slices
of<00:01:05.700> America<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.540> wanted<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> feature<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.890> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of America you wanted to feature in this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.870 
of America you wanted to feature in this
road<00:01:08.250> trip<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.549> look

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
road trip you know it's I think we look

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
road trip you know it's I think we look
at<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> from<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> gameplay<00:01:12.630> perspective<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
at it from a gameplay perspective is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
at it from a gameplay perspective is
where<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.040> create<00:01:14.310> cool<00:01:14.580> moments<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
where can we create cool moments and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.609 
where can we create cool moments and
make<00:01:15.420> cool<00:01:15.630> drives<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.409> probably

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
make cool drives and that's probably

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.649 
make cool drives and that's probably
where<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.040> started<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
where we started and so that kind of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
where we started and so that kind of
naturally<00:01:19.110> takes<00:01:19.320> us<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.710> various<00:01:20.009> parts

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
naturally takes us through various parts

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
naturally takes us through various parts
of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> country<00:01:20.869> obviously<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.080> other

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
of the country obviously we got other

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
of the country obviously we got other
big<00:01:22.470> cities<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.830> Chicago<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> were<00:01:23.700> going

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
big cities like Chicago that were going

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
big cities like Chicago that were going
through<00:01:24.000> Las<00:01:24.600> Vegas<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> might<00:01:25.560> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
through Las Vegas that we might be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
through Las Vegas that we might be
driving<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.390> there's<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> there's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
driving by so there's a there's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
driving by so there's a there's
definitely<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:29.070> real<00:01:29.700> sense<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.150> thought

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
definitely a real sense of what thought

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.880 
definitely a real sense of what thought
we<00:01:30.659> thought<00:01:30.840> would<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.049> cool<00:01:31.380> gameplay<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
we thought would make cool gameplay and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
we thought would make cool gameplay and
also<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.520> cool<00:01:32.700> environments<00:01:33.270> for

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
also make just cool environments for

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
also make just cool environments for
people<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.659> drive<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
people to drive through and you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.230

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
been like taking this engine that's you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.740 
been like taking this engine that's you
know<00:01:44.670> traditionally<00:01:45.149> been<00:01:45.270> used<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.600> these

first-person shooters and adapting it
for<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.329> racing<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.930> imagine<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.649> come

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
for a racing game I imagine that's come

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
for a racing game I imagine that's come
with<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.250> some<00:01:51.060> hurdles<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> guys

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
with some some hurdles that you guys

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
with some some hurdles that you guys
have<00:01:51.899> overcome<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.530> well<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.159> definitely

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
have overcome right well we definitely

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.160 
have overcome right well we definitely
had<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> help<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> guys<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:54.840> dice

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
had a lot of help from the guys at dice

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.649 
had a lot of help from the guys at dice
which<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.649> been<00:01:55.799> great<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:57.060> certainly<00:01:57.479> it's

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
which has been great and certainly it's

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.880 
which has been great and certainly it's
been<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> challenge<00:01:58.229> turning<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> into<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
been a challenge turning it into a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.350 
been a challenge turning it into a
driving<00:01:59.310> engine<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.180> kind

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
driving engine but you know we're kind

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
driving engine but you know we're kind
of<00:02:00.479> seeing<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.899> light<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> end<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of seeing the light at the end of that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
of seeing the light at the end of that
tunnel<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.280> point<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.790> game<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
tunnel at this point with this game and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
tunnel at this point with this game and
it<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.710> opened<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.159> whole<00:02:05.280> new

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it just really opened up a whole new

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.520 
it just really opened up a whole new
world<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> opportunities<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.509> terms<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.960> what

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
world of opportunities in terms of what

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.570 
world of opportunities in terms of what
we<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> engine<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
we can do with the engine the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
we can do with the engine the
flexibility<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> tool<00:02:09.539> set<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:09.959> then

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
flexibility of the tool set and then

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.280 
flexibility of the tool set and then
what<00:02:10.500> comes<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
what comes with it is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.440 
what comes with it is
even<00:02:11.500> even<00:02:11.920> better<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.370> terms<00:02:12.519> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.209> hot

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
even even better in terms of the hot

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.209 
even even better in terms of the hot
visuals<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.290> get<00:02:14.500> an<00:02:14.680> obviously<00:02:14.980> great

where are you guys trying to aim with
this<00:02:34.930> game<00:02:35.260> we're<00:02:35.890> trying<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.220> aim<00:02:36.340> right

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
this game we're trying to aim right

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.819 
this game we're trying to aim right
around<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> middle<00:02:37.239> between<00:02:37.959> arcade<00:02:38.620> and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
around in the middle between arcade and

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.339 
around in the middle between arcade and
simulation<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.549> think<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:41.049> know<00:02:41.139> based

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
simulation I think just you know based

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.509 
simulation I think just you know based
on<00:02:41.500> where<00:02:41.620> we're<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:41.769> now<00:02:41.829> I<00:02:42.010> feel<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.310> we've

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
on where we're at now I feel like we've

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.330 
on where we're at now I feel like we've
struck<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.849> balance<00:02:42.909> pretty<00:02:43.450> effectively

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
struck that balance pretty effectively

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.170 
struck that balance pretty effectively
obviously<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.639> know<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.909> end<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
obviously you know one end of the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.699 
obviously you know one end of the
spectrum<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.720> may<00:02:46.930> look<00:02:47.049> at<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> game<00:02:47.379> like<00:02:47.500> hot

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
spectrum you may look at a game like hot

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.740 
spectrum you may look at a game like hot
pursuit<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.250> has<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.120> pretty<00:02:49.269> Arkady

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
pursuit that has you know pretty Arkady

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.539 
pursuit that has you know pretty Arkady
sort<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.620> controls<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> then<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.519> other

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
sort of controls and then on the other

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.069 
sort of controls and then on the other
end<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.909> the<00:02:51.970> spectrum<00:02:52.060> game<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.659> ship<00:02:52.870> which

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
end of the spectrum game like ship which

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.720 
end of the spectrum game like ship which
is<00:02:53.230> much<00:02:53.530> more<00:02:53.709> simulation<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.459> realism

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is much more simulation and realism

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.699 
is much more simulation and realism
focused<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.989> we<00:02:56.109> try<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.349> obviously

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
focused and so we try to obviously

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.559 
focused and so we try to obviously
strike<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.099> balance<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.459> between<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:58.000> cars

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
strike the balance in between so cars

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.849 
strike the balance in between so cars
that<00:02:58.750> are<00:02:58.840> easy<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.109> pick<00:02:59.349> up<00:02:59.379> and<00:02:59.620> play

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
that are easy to pick up and play

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.319 
that are easy to pick up and play
controls<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.400> are<00:03:00.459> easy<00:03:00.669> to<00:03:00.760> sort<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.120> get

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329

you're<00:03:21.010> sort<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.310> jumping<00:03:21.639> around<00:03:21.760> these

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you're sort of jumping around these

different<00:03:22.389> automobiles<00:03:22.840> well<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> lot<00:03:23.859> of<00:03:23.889> its

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
different automobiles well a lot of its

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.800

going<00:03:24.159> to<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.310> driven<00:03:24.489> by<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:24.729> story<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.510> I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
going to be driven by the story so I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.379 
going to be driven by the story so I
think<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.169> we<00:03:26.290> showed<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.829> Chicago<00:03:27.459> is<00:03:28.000> where

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
think what we showed in Chicago is where

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.210 
think what we showed in Chicago is where
you<00:03:28.690> know<00:03:28.780> jackets<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.620> knocked<00:03:29.829> out<00:03:29.949> of<00:03:30.129> his

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.159 
you know jackets get knocked out of his
car<00:03:30.489> through<00:03:30.729> an<00:03:30.879> accident<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.510> he<00:03:31.870> just

car through an accident and he just

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.569 
car through an accident and he just
basically<00:03:32.319> has<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.859> figure<00:03:33.010> out<00:03:33.220> how<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> get

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
basically has to figure out how to get

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.339 
basically has to figure out how to get
out<00:03:33.729> of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.909> city<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.870> there's<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.199> to<00:03:35.290> be

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
experience where he's going to be forced

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.140 
experience where he's going to be forced
to<00:03:38.349> adapt<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.010> story<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.549> situation

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150
