00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.250
 Well I'm tactile and I bring you a new 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.410
 trick of t5 online version 1.20 is 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.240
 say for the new generation which 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.849
 will allow us to gain infinite respect 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 without help completely alone and it will be a 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.419
 race like the previous group that I went up 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.340
 in the previous channel it is worth so that as 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.070
 you see we 're going to create by rockstar and you 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.740
 call in the races so nothing 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.050
 let's go over there 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.940
 as well we appear as always is a 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.440
 normal career and the only 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.600
 trick here is the world record 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.820
 it appears as you see us down 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.620
 world record with which he will put it 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.210
 as a world record what we do in the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.010
 first round so what we have 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.230
 what to do to improve ourselves all the time 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.300
 is to make a bad return is worth the first 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.400
 once in a bad lap so as you see 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.460
 I believe that if he does not have cocks for 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.310
 treat I knight and all that me but 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.890
 a little and nothing kids is like this all the 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.809
 It's worth as long as you know, I went up a 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.270
 well but good is still working the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.400
 theory does not work that's why it was and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.630
 As you can see in this race, you have to 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.040
 do two laps to count as 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 one is very rare but good as you see 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.700
 we are back quickly and it gives us 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.660
 5000 pp what has been in an hour 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 500,000 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.450
 rp more or less so kids is a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.090
 very good race to do it all 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.470
 the time and earn a lot much level like 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.910
 you see now we have to overcome 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.710
 so that you do not notice is the fast lap 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.479
 and then we'll wait for the next 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.820
 again and so all the kids to 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.369
 pressure will not be 5,000 tcp what's coming 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 being as I already say between 300 thousand and 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.090
 50 thousand x 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.830
 so it's not going to level up all a 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.520
 greeting and until next time 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.520
 goodbye
