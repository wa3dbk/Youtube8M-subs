Scorpion<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.559> actually<00:00:45.309> took<00:00:45.519> me<00:00:45.790> let<00:00:46.030> me<00:00:46.120> see

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
Scorpion it actually took me let me see

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.390 
Scorpion it actually took me let me see
let<00:00:46.330> me<00:00:46.480> bring<00:00:46.720> it<00:00:46.840> up<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.260> actually<00:00:47.680> didn't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
let me bring it up it actually didn't

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.579 
let me bring it up it actually didn't
well<00:00:49.150> I<00:00:49.180> guess<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.660> could<00:00:49.809> consider<00:00:50.080> that<00:00:50.440> it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
well I guess you could consider that it

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.250 
well I guess you could consider that it
took<00:00:50.710> me<00:00:50.920> about<00:00:51.159> 34<00:00:52.030> minutes<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:52.540> 12<00:00:52.780> seconds

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
took me about 34 minutes and 12 seconds

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.009 
took me about 34 minutes and 12 seconds
to<00:00:53.799> record<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.729> good<00:00:55.150> gameplay<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:55.750> that's

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
to record a good gameplay so that's

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.780 
to record a good gameplay so that's
about<00:00:56.320> what<00:00:56.589> two<00:00:56.830> or<00:00:56.860> three<00:00:57.159> gameplays<00:00:57.549> I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
about what two or three gameplays I

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.469 
about what two or three gameplays I
think<00:00:58.299> that's<00:00:58.479> three<00:00:58.809> games<00:00:59.080> i<00:00:59.320> think<00:00:59.559> but<00:01:00.479> i'm

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
think that's three games i think but i'm

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.670 
think that's three games i think but i'm
going<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.690> tell<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:01.900> guys<00:01:02.049> how<00:01:02.199> long<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.500> takes

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
going to tell you guys how long it takes

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.410 
going to tell you guys how long it takes
for<00:01:02.860> each<00:01:02.979> episode<00:01:03.430> because<00:01:03.909> it's<00:01:04.180> kind<00:01:04.360> of

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
for each episode because it's kind of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.330 
for each episode because it's kind of
funny<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.049> Scorpion<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:05.650> actually<00:01:06.010> a<00:01:06.040> pretty

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
funny the Scorpion is actually a pretty

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.800 
funny the Scorpion is actually a pretty
horrible<00:01:06.700> weapon<00:01:06.940> when<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.360> really<00:01:07.659> comes

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
horrible weapon when it really comes

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.770 
horrible weapon when it really comes
down<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:09.670> close<00:01:09.940> range<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.390> probably

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
down to it at close range it's probably

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.210 
down to it at close range it's probably
the<00:01:10.930> best<00:01:11.110> gun<00:01:11.290> in<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.470> game<00:01:11.619> because<00:01:11.799> it<00:01:12.070> does

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
the best gun in the game because it does

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.340 
the best gun in the game because it does
50<00:01:12.549> damage<00:01:12.760> at<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.330> cat<00:01:13.630> like<00:01:13.869> shotgun

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
50 damage at really cat like shotgun

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.920 
50 damage at really cat like shotgun
distance<00:01:14.710> range<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.580> i<00:01:15.610> mean<00:01:15.820> it's<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:16.659> no

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
distance range so i mean it's it's no

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.750 
distance range so i mean it's it's no
it's<00:01:17.200> no<00:01:17.290> coincidence<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:18.040> i<00:01:18.189> did<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
it's no coincidence that i did get the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's no coincidence that i did get the
gameplay<00:01:19.150> here<00:01:19.330> on<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.659> map<00:01:19.810> nuketown

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
gameplay here on the map nuketown

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.860 
gameplay here on the map nuketown
obviously<00:01:21.820> it's<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:21.970> smallest<00:01:22.270> map<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
obviously it's the smallest map it's the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.330 
obviously it's the smallest map it's the
most<00:01:23.020> closed<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.830> Scorpion<00:01:24.250> is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
most closed in so the Scorpion is

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.800 
most closed in so the Scorpion is
actually<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.730> good<00:01:25.060> choice<00:01:25.330> on<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.660> map

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
actually a good choice on the map

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.110 
actually a good choice on the map
newtown<00:01:26.230> but<00:01:26.890> for<00:01:27.040> any<00:01:27.160> other<00:01:27.310> weapon<00:01:27.730> I<00:01:27.910> mean

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
newtown but for any other weapon I mean

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.000 
newtown but for any other weapon I mean
for<00:01:28.270> any<00:01:28.420> other<00:01:28.510> map<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.960> would<00:01:29.230> probably<00:01:29.620> not

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
for any other map I would probably not

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.400 
for any other map I would probably not
use<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.400> weapon<00:01:30.610> at<00:01:30.850> all<00:01:31.030> um<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:32.080> know<00:01:32.200> at

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
use this weapon at all um you know at

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.320 
use this weapon at all um you know at
long<00:01:32.650> distance<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.220> can<00:01:33.250> be<00:01:33.460> up<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.970> five

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
long distance it can be up to a five

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.660 
long distance it can be up to a five
shot<00:01:34.360> kill<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.230> i<00:01:35.350> mean<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.550> that's

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
shot kill and i mean that's like that's

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.130 
shot kill and i mean that's like that's
like<00:01:37.030> pistol<00:01:37.510> damage<00:01:37.810> you're<00:01:37.930> better<00:01:38.080> off

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
like pistol damage you're better off

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440 
like pistol damage you're better off
with<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.470> pistol<00:01:38.800> at<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.430> at<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.730> distance<00:01:40.090> i

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
with a pistol at that at that distance i

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.500 
with a pistol at that at that distance i
mean<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:40.750> like<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.400> like<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.970> said<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.420> know

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
mean it's like so like I said you know

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.300 
mean it's like so like I said you know
the<00:01:43.750> scorpions<00:01:44.200> not<00:01:44.380> really<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.740> best<00:01:44.770> gun<00:01:45.160> to

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
the scorpions not really the best gun to

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.430 
the scorpions not really the best gun to
choose<00:01:45.580> um<00:01:45.940> but<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.720> did<00:01:46.840> not<00:01:46.870> take<00:01:47.200> me

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
choose um but it did not take me

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.649 
choose um but it did not take me
actually<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:48.040> long<00:01:48.250> I've<00:01:49.090> been<00:01:49.120> actually

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
actually that long I've been actually

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.600

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
know it was a little obviously the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.320

series

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
series

series
gonna<00:02:32.450> be<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> little<00:02:32.720> bit<00:02:32.930> stressful<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.440> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
gonna be a little bit stressful when it

gonna be a little bit stressful when it
comes<00:02:33.710> down<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.070> harder<00:02:34.340> weapons<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.850> you

comes down to the harder weapons but you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.240 
comes down to the harder weapons but you
know<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.360> shouldn't<00:02:35.630> be<00:02:35.690> too<00:02:35.840> hard<00:02:36.160> when<00:02:37.160> it

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
know it shouldn't be too hard when it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.800

like I said I wouldn't really recommend

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
like I said I wouldn't really recommend
the<00:02:49.100> scorpion<00:02:49.520> but<00:02:49.670> if<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.120> use<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.360> I

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
the scorpion but if you do use it I

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.230 
the scorpion but if you do use it I
would<00:02:50.780> definitely<00:02:51.020> put<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:52.030> extended<00:02:53.030> mags

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240

good aim with the rapid fire um it goes
through<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.600> bullets<00:02:59.930> really<00:03:00.350> fast<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:00.830> if

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
through the bullets really fast but if

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.160

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
you know just my opinion more bolts to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.729 
you know just my opinion more bolts to
shoot<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.640> stuff<00:03:34.850> less<00:03:35.150> reloading<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.810> slide

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
think attacker because in team

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.830 
think attacker because in team
deathmatch<00:03:40.700> there's<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.180> lot<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.360> claim<00:03:41.630> wears

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
deathmatch there's a lot of claim wears

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.660 
deathmatch there's a lot of claim wears
a<00:03:41.900> lot<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.260> motion<00:03:42.739> sensors<00:03:43.250> stuff<00:03:43.489> like<00:03:43.640> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
a lot of motion sensors stuff like that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.090 
a lot of motion sensors stuff like that
and<00:03:44.050> i'm<00:03:45.050> actually<00:03:45.260> using<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.769> piece<00:03:45.980> of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
and i'm actually using this piece of

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.479 
and i'm actually using this piece of
equipment<00:03:46.190> called<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.790> jammer<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:48.310> if<00:03:49.310> you

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
equipment called a jammer and if you

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.030 
equipment called a jammer and if you
guys<00:03:49.610> don't<00:03:50.000> really<00:03:50.330> try<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.660> if<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.989> don't<00:03:51.500> if

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
guys don't really try it if you don't if

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.320 
guys don't really try it if you don't if
you<00:03:52.100> don't<00:03:52.310> have<00:03:52.550> it<00:03:52.730> or<00:03:52.850> don't<00:03:53.030> buy<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.239> think

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
you don't have it or don't buy I think

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.870 
you don't have it or don't buy I think
it's<00:03:53.630> worthless<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.260> actually<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.700> like

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.640 
it's worthless I actually really like
this<00:03:56.030> jammer<00:03:56.300> if<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.570> set<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.900> down<00:03:56.989> in<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.500> nice

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
this jammer if you set it down in a nice

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.320 
this jammer if you set it down in a nice
spot<00:03:57.950> especially<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.550> Nuketown<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:58.970> takes<00:03:59.150> up

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
spot especially on Nuketown it takes up

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.840 
spot especially on Nuketown it takes up
like<00:03:59.510> half<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.170> map<00:04:00.350> really<00:04:00.739> ticket<00:04:01.489> can<00:04:01.640> take

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
like half the map really ticket can take

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.570 
like half the map really ticket can take
up<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.120> whole<00:04:02.239> building<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.620> one<00:04:03.769> side<00:04:03.800> so

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
up a whole building on the one side so

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.890 
up a whole building on the one side so
if<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.820> plant<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.239> baby<00:04:05.480> right<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
if you plant this baby right in the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.360 
if you plant this baby right in the
middle<00:04:06.050> of<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.230> map<00:04:06.410> or<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.830> know<00:04:06.950> hide<00:04:07.220> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
middle of the map or you know hide it

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.520 
middle of the map or you know hide it
somewhere<00:04:07.580> in<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.850> building<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:09.140> actually

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
somewhere in the building it's actually

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.620 
somewhere in the building it's actually
pretty<00:04:09.680> effective<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> takes<00:04:10.489> out<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.000> it

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
pretty effective it takes out all the it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.500 
pretty effective it takes out all the it
jams<00:04:11.930> all<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.350> enemy<00:04:12.650> radars<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.820> that<00:04:14.269> area

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
jams all the enemy radars in that area

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.409 
jams all the enemy radars in that area
ended<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.590> breaks<00:04:16.459> all<00:04:16.729> claymores<00:04:17.239> in

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
ended and it breaks all claymores in

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.900 
ended and it breaks all claymores in
motion<00:04:17.840> sensor<00:04:18.169> stuff<00:04:18.440> like<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.070> most<00:04:19.790> of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
motion sensor stuff like that so most of

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.060 
motion sensor stuff like that so most of
the<00:04:19.970> time<00:04:20.150> you'll<00:04:21.049> see<00:04:21.260> me<00:04:21.410> here<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:21.830> see<00:04:22.040> a

the time you'll see me here if I see a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.040 
the time you'll see me here if I see a
couple<00:04:22.340> claymores<00:04:23.060> or<00:04:23.210> something<00:04:23.540> in<00:04:23.660> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
couple claymores or something in the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.450 
couple claymores or something in the
building<00:04:24.350> before<00:04:24.530> I<00:04:24.710> go<00:04:24.890> in<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.100> building<00:04:25.250> I

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
building before I go in the building I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.760

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.710 
and what I'm thinking about doing is
maybe<00:05:00.550> what<00:05:01.550> I'm<00:05:01.670> thinking<00:05:02.030> about<00:05:02.120> doing<00:05:02.300> as

maybe what I'm thinking about doing as

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.630 
maybe what I'm thinking about doing as
far<00:05:02.900> as<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.140> controllers<00:05:03.710> go<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.550> know

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
far as the controllers go you know

kind<00:06:20.720> of<00:06:20.810> sucks<00:06:21.050> um<00:06:21.380> but<00:06:21.650> I<00:06:21.680> believe<00:06:21.950> my<00:06:22.100> final

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
kind of sucks um but I believe my final

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.600 
kind of sucks um but I believe my final
score<00:06:22.610> was<00:06:22.730> like<00:06:22.910> 34<00:06:23.630> and<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.100> for<00:06:25.100> I<00:06:25.130> think<00:06:25.430> or

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
score was like 34 and and for I think or

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.730 
score was like 34 and and for I think or
32<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:26.480> for<00:06:26.660> something<00:06:27.080> like<00:06:27.169> that<00:06:27.230> somewhere

32 and for something like that somewhere

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.770 
32 and for something like that somewhere
around<00:06:27.890> there<00:06:28.190> still<00:06:29.150> a<00:06:29.180> pretty<00:06:29.240> decent

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780
