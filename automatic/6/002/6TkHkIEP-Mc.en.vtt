ease<00:01:05.229> anymore<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.090> think<00:01:07.329> if<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.570> could

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
ease anymore and I think if I could

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.840 
ease anymore and I think if I could
catch<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.049> on<00:01:08.140> tape<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:09.340> mean<00:01:09.520> if<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.729> could

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
catch it on tape and I mean if I could

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.310 
catch it on tape and I mean if I could
maybe<00:01:10.210> I'll<00:01:10.390> just<00:01:10.509> know<00:01:10.780> it's<00:01:10.990> like<00:01:11.110> maybe

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
maybe I'll just know it's like maybe

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.600 
maybe I'll just know it's like maybe
it's<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.560> neighborhood<00:01:11.920> kids<00:01:12.189> maybe<00:01:12.399> they're

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
it's the neighborhood kids maybe they're

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's the neighborhood kids maybe they're
just<00:01:12.759> pulling<00:01:13.000> tricks<00:01:13.329> on<00:01:13.479> me<00:01:13.509> or<00:01:13.600> something
