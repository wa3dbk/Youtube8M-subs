feeling it's going to be tough today
Chris<00:00:46.289> yeah<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> be

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Chris yeah I think it is going to be

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.850 
Chris yeah I think it is going to be
tough<00:00:47.579> i<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:49.710> some

tough i think if we can just put some

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
tough i think if we can just put some
more<00:00:49.950> PVA<00:00:50.309> bags<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.879> show<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.210> fish<00:00:51.420> maybe<00:00:51.780> glug

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
more PVA bags to show in fish maybe glug

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.340 
more PVA bags to show in fish maybe glug
bags<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.649> high<00:00:53.430> attract<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.960> try<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.170> nikka
