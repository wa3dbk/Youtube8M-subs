the<00:00:27.580> game<00:00:27.730> yet<00:00:28.029> then<00:00:28.270> this<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.900> video<00:00:29.200> you

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
the game yet then this is the video you

the game yet then this is the video you
really<00:00:29.710> need<00:00:29.829> to<00:00:29.860> be<00:00:29.980> looking<00:00:30.189> at<00:00:30.279> before<00:00:30.400> you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
really need to be looking at before you

really need to be looking at before you
actually<00:00:30.730> get<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.060> game<00:00:31.300> because<00:00:31.689> they<00:00:31.810> are

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
actually get the game because they are

got a team set up which has 100%

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.569 
got a team set up which has 100%
chemistry<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.470> some<00:00:38.710> very<00:00:38.920> decent<00:00:39.280> chemistry

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
chemistry and some very decent chemistry

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.490 
chemistry and some very decent chemistry
styles<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:40.000> there<00:00:40.180> as<00:00:40.300> well<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:40.989> feel<00:00:41.170> free<00:00:41.199> to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
works really well it's not perfect but

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.639 
works really well it's not perfect but

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.570 

okay<00:00:57.470> so<00:00:57.530> starting<00:00:57.920> off<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:58.100> goalkeeping

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
okay so starting off with goalkeeping

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.980 
okay so starting off with goalkeeping
the<00:00:58.700> first<00:00:58.940> chemistry<00:00:59.300> hour<00:00:59.510> we'll<00:00:59.720> look<00:00:59.840> at

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
the first chemistry hour we'll look at

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.220 
the first chemistry hour we'll look at
his<00:01:00.140> wall<00:01:00.170> which<00:01:01.210> advances<00:01:02.210> dive<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:02.780> handling

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
his wall which advances dive in handling

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.780 
his wall which advances dive in handling
and<00:01:03.440> kicking<00:01:03.740> it's<00:01:03.890> not<00:01:04.010> perfect<00:01:04.550> but<00:01:04.670> it's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
and kicking it's not perfect but it's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.640 
and kicking it's not perfect but it's
okay<00:01:05.210> for<00:01:05.270> sort<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.600> generic<00:01:05.960> goalkeepers

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
okay for sort of generic goalkeepers

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.840 
okay for sort of generic goalkeepers
that<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.860> just<00:01:07.010> can<00:01:07.160> have<00:01:07.280> any<00:01:07.430> squad<00:01:07.670> from

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
that you just can have any squad from

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.900 
that you just can have any squad from
time<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.150> time<00:01:08.350> shield<00:01:09.350> boost<00:01:09.980> kicking<00:01:10.490> speed

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
time to time shield boost kicking speed

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.370 
time to time shield boost kicking speed
and<00:01:11.150> reflexes<00:01:11.270> that's<00:01:11.780> better<00:01:11.960> for<00:01:12.200> you

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
and reflexes that's better for you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.140 
and reflexes that's better for you
slower<00:01:13.160> goalkeepers<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> want<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.120> a

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
slower goalkeepers you want to have a

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.050 
slower goalkeepers you want to have a
bit<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.390> kick<00:01:14.540> in<00:01:14.720> speed<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.200> reflex<00:01:15.710> boost

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
bit of a kick in speed and reflex boost

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.700 
bit of a kick in speed and reflex boost
cat<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.330> good<00:01:17.690> for<00:01:17.900> reflexive<00:01:18.380> speed<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
cat is good for reflexive speed and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.020 
cat is good for reflexive speed and
positioning<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.490> check<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:19.880> works

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
positioning so with check it works

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.370 
positioning so with check it works
pretty<00:01:20.540> well<00:01:20.660> it<00:01:20.870> makes<00:01:20.960> me<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.140> little<00:01:21.230> bit

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
pretty well it makes me a little bit

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.900 
pretty well it makes me a little bit
quicker<00:01:21.620> but<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.190> does<00:01:22.310> fumble<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.700> ball<00:01:22.730> a

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
quicker but it does fumble the ball a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.750 
quicker but it does fumble the ball a
lot<00:01:23.120> more<00:01:23.470> moving<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.070> next<00:01:25.370> one<00:01:25.460> which

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
lot more moving on to the next one which

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.820 
lot more moving on to the next one which
is<00:01:25.790> glove<00:01:26.120> which<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.390> my<00:01:26.510> personal<00:01:26.750> favor<00:01:27.140> that

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
is glove which is my personal favor that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.410 
is glove which is my personal favor that
does<00:01:28.010> dive<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.460> handling<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.000> positioning

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
does dive in handling and positioning

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420 
does dive in handling and positioning
which<00:01:29.600> absolutely<00:01:29.920> fantastically<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:31.040> use<00:01:31.280> it

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
which absolutely fantastically I use it

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.130 
which absolutely fantastically I use it
on<00:01:31.520> new<00:01:31.670> enough<00:01:31.910> all<00:01:32.090> my<00:01:32.270> keepers<00:01:32.660> apart<00:01:33.020> from

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
on new enough all my keepers apart from

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.310 
on new enough all my keepers apart from
boo<00:01:33.290> from<00:01:33.500> which<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.830> pop<00:01:34.060> shield<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.300> basic<00:01:36.170> it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
boo from which a pop shield on basic it

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.780 
boo from which a pop shield on basic it
doesn't<00:01:36.560> alter<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.830> stats<00:01:37.160> at<00:01:37.400> all<00:01:37.580> so<00:01:37.729> you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
doesn't alter the stats at all so you

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.609 
doesn't alter the stats at all so you
keep<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.150> basic<00:01:38.600> keeper<00:01:39.050> but<00:01:39.410> obviously

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
keep your basic keeper but obviously

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.230 
keep your basic keeper but obviously
will<00:01:39.890> fall<00:01:40.100> down<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.460> certain<00:01:40.760> areas<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.119> his

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
will fall down in certain areas of his

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.590 
will fall down in certain areas of his
stats<00:01:41.510> that<00:01:41.660> are<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.810> bit<00:01:41.960> weaker

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.760 

defendant<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.630> always<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.900> tricky<00:01:51.080> subject

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
defendant is always a tricky subject

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.459 
defendant is always a tricky subject
a<00:01:51.829> bird<00:01:52.219> here<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:52.939> go<00:01:53.200> Sentinel<00:01:54.200> boost

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
a bird here we go Sentinel boost

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.840 
a bird here we go Sentinel boost
defending<00:01:54.979> head<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:55.429> you<00:01:55.520> can<00:01:55.579> use<00:01:55.729> that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
maestro so they've got a bit creativity

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.610 
maestro so they've got a bit creativity
going<00:05:24.150> in<00:05:24.270> now<00:05:24.510> or<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.080> can<00:05:25.230> actually<00:05:25.500> use

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
going in now or you can actually use

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.550 
going in now or you can actually use
dead<00:05:25.890> i<00:05:25.920> which<00:05:26.250> i<00:05:26.460> have<00:05:26.900> tried<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.930> use<00:05:28.230> now<00:05:28.410> and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
dead i which i have tried to use now and

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.910 
dead i which i have tried to use now and
again<00:05:28.770> i<00:05:29.300> give<00:05:30.300> my<00:05:30.510> cam<00:05:30.810> an<00:05:31.050> engine<00:05:31.590> because

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
again i give my cam an engine because

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.010 
again i give my cam an engine because
he's<00:05:32.250> up<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.670> down<00:05:32.850> all<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.060> time<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.630> the

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
he's up and down all the time and the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.410 
he's up and down all the time and the
forwards<00:05:34.440> as<00:05:34.650> i<00:05:34.770> mentioned<00:05:35.130> earlier<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.970> hawk

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
forwards as i mentioned earlier a hawk

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.590 
forwards as i mentioned earlier a hawk
now<00:05:37.410> will<00:05:37.620> distress<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.520> boosts<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.360> are

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
now will distress the boosts that are

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.110 
now will distress the boosts that are

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
show you now what would happen if I was

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.350 
show you now what would happen if I was
to<00:05:52.770> put<00:05:52.950> Giovinco<00:05:53.520> in<00:05:53.640> there<00:05:53.820> for<00:05:53.940> example<00:05:54.270> it

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
to put Giovinco in there for example it

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.480 
to put Giovinco in there for example it
can<00:05:54.540> and<00:05:54.780> show<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.530> his<00:05:55.740> chemistry<00:05:56.160> which<00:05:56.340> is

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
can and show you his chemistry which is

whatsoever<00:06:02.670> and<00:06:03.090> he'd<00:06:03.390> actually<00:06:03.540> played<00:06:03.840> very

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
whatsoever and he'd actually played very

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.470 
whatsoever and he'd actually played very
very<00:06:04.110> poorly<00:06:04.560> in<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.920> match<00:06:05.340> itself<00:06:05.550> also

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
very poorly in the match itself also

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.970 
very poorly in the match itself also
affects<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.140> others<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.470> doesn't<00:06:07.500> affect<00:06:07.860> him

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
affects the others it doesn't affect him

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.320 
affects the others it doesn't affect him
too<00:06:08.130> much<00:06:08.280> because<00:06:08.460> they've<00:06:08.670> got<00:06:08.820> four<00:06:09.030> green

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
too much because they've got four green

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.410 
too much because they've got four green
links<00:06:09.690> but<00:06:10.190> Giovinco<00:06:11.190> himself<00:06:11.610> would<00:06:11.970> play

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
links but Giovinco himself would play

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.440 
links but Giovinco himself would play
absolutely<00:06:13.580> atrociously<00:06:14.580> so<00:06:15.120> there's<00:06:15.330> not

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
absolutely atrociously so there's not

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.970 
absolutely atrociously so there's not
really<00:06:15.750> any<00:06:16.020> point<00:06:16.260> in<00:06:16.380> having<00:06:16.500> him<00:06:16.680> in<00:06:16.770> there

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
really any point in having him in there

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.470 
really any point in having him in there
it's<00:06:17.460> always<00:06:17.580> make<00:06:17.820> sure<00:06:17.850> you've<00:06:18.150> got<00:06:18.180> for

it's always make sure you've got for

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.870 
it's always make sure you've got for
chemistry<00:06:18.870> as<00:06:19.110> much<00:06:19.410> as<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:19.620> can<00:06:19.800> so<00:06:20.370> pop<00:06:20.700> back

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
chemistry as much as you can so pop back

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.270 
chemistry as much as you can so pop back
