it online so i figured i'd post one of
my<00:00:09.179> own<00:00:09.330> look<00:00:10.320> around<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.679> outside<00:00:11.070> really

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
my own look around the outside really

quickly<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> front<00:00:12.179> here<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.630> mesh<00:00:13.340> pops

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

open<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.450> couple<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.560> fans<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.850> lint

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
guess you could just vacuumed them if

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.420 
guess you could just vacuumed them if
you<00:00:22.350> want<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> install<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:22.859> hard<00:00:23.160> drives

through the slot here on the bottom but
it<00:01:22.680> won't<00:01:22.890> allow<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> side<00:01:24.720> panel

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it won't allow you to put the side panel

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.880 
it won't allow you to put the side panel
back<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:28.159> looking<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> other<00:01:29.520> side<00:01:29.850> now

there's<00:01:31.890> plenty<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> room<00:01:33.560> again<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.770> main

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there's plenty of room again my main

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
there's plenty of room again my main
power<00:01:35.400> cable<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> pretty<00:01:36.299> stiff<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
power cable here is pretty stiff so I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
power cable here is pretty stiff so I
couldn't<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.409> much<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.490> terms<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
couldn't do much with that in terms of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
couldn't do much with that in terms of
cable<00:01:39.570> management<00:01:39.750> otherwise<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.560> could

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cable management otherwise you could

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560 
cable management otherwise you could
probably<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.310> through<00:01:41.670> around<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> back

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
probably put it through around the back

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
probably put it through around the back

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
really see it through the jumble but I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
really see it through the jumble but I
have<00:01:48.390> two<00:01:48.570> hard<00:01:48.810> drives<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
have two hard drives down here on the

plastic tray system that xbo seems to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.999 
plastic tray system that xbo seems to
use<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.799> snapping<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.270> hard<00:02:00.860> almost<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
use the snapping really hard almost to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.810 
use the snapping really hard almost to
the<00:02:02.100> point<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.670> you're

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the point that you would think you're

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
the point that you would think you're
going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> break<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.600> little<00:02:03.810> bracket<00:02:04.259> form

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
going to break the little bracket form

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.029 
going to break the little bracket form
but<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.899> guess<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> way<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.710> designed

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
but I guess that's the way they designed

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.930 
but I guess that's the way they designed
it<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.340> reason<00:02:08.959> another<00:02:09.959> fan<00:02:10.319> up<00:02:10.530> top<00:02:10.879> or<00:02:11.879> on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it for a reason another fan up top or on

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
it for a reason another fan up top or on
the<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.360> rather

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the back rather

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.020 
the back rather
to<00:02:12.930> fans<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> top<00:02:16.670> quick<00:02:17.670> look<00:02:17.849> at<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
to fans on the top quick look at the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.199 
to fans on the top quick look at the
bottom<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.950> dust<00:02:20.580> filter<00:02:20.970> for

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
bottom here this is the dust filter for

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.150 
bottom here this is the dust filter for
the<00:02:21.239> power<00:02:21.930> supply<00:02:22.230> unit<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.099> of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the power supply unit just kind of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.070 
the power supply unit just kind of
slides<00:02:23.459> out<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.209> could<00:02:24.390> clean<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.660> off<00:02:24.870> if

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
slides out and you could clean it off if

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.460 
slides out and you could clean it off if
you<00:02:25.200> need<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.560> need<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:30.230> quick<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.440> while

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you need to need to quick look while

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.500 
you need to need to quick look while
while<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> lights<00:02:32.580> are<00:02:32.790> still<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> it's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
while the lights are still on and it's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.199 
while the lights are still on and it's
all<00:02:33.660> lit<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.340> fan<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.580> bottom<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.120> the

all lit up the fan on the bottom in the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.600 
all lit up the fan on the bottom in the
front<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> fan<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> back<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.489> can

front and the fan in the back as you can

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.920 
front and the fan in the back as you can
see<00:02:38.819> are<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> ones<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.239> light<00:02:39.540> up<00:02:39.569> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
see are the ones that light up and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.620 
see are the ones that light up and
change<00:02:40.170> colors<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.709> well<00:02:40.739> as<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> four

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
change colors as well as the four

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
lights on topper from the motherboard

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.490 
lights on topper from the motherboard
but<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:48.630> kind<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.140> looks<00:02:49.319> like

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
but that's kind of what it looks like

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.690 
but that's kind of what it looks like
see<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.600> colors<00:02:51.600> slowly<00:02:51.959> shift<00:02:52.350> through<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
see the colors slowly shift through the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.770 
see the colors slowly shift through the
whole<00:02:53.880> rainbow<00:02:54.150> all<00:02:54.840> kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.230> magical<00:02:59.780> and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
whole rainbow all kind of magical and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140 
whole rainbow all kind of magical and
then<00:03:00.810> one<00:03:01.410> last<00:03:01.590> look<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.160> with<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.519> lights<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
then one last look now with the lights a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.070 
then one last look now with the lights a
little<00:03:03.750> bit<00:03:04.080> more<00:03:04.260> off

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.660 

I<00:03:09.200> don't<00:03:09.740> know<00:03:09.800> how<00:03:09.890> much<00:03:09.980> noise<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.520> getting

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
I don't know how much noise is getting

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.300 
I don't know how much noise is getting
picked<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.090> by<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.330> microphone<00:03:11.900> but<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.530> case

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
picked up by the microphone but the case

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
picked up by the microphone but the case
fans<00:03:13.670> are<00:03:13.940> pretty<00:03:14.720> quiet<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.410> loudest<00:03:16.130> fan

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
fans are pretty quiet the loudest fan

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.550 
fans are pretty quiet the loudest fan
and<00:03:16.550> my<00:03:16.640> computer<00:03:17.330> here<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> CPU<00:03:18.320> fan

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
and my computer here is the CPU fan

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.340 
and my computer here is the CPU fan
nothing<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.130> can<00:03:19.280> really<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.610> about<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:20.350> if

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
nothing I can really do about that if

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.950 
nothing I can really do about that if
you<00:03:21.530> press<00:03:21.800> this<00:03:22.180> left<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.360> button<00:03:23.660> here

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
you press this left the button here

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.040 
you press this left the button here
it'll<00:03:24.590> actually<00:03:24.830> lock<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.550> color<00:03:26.050> wherever

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
it'll actually lock the color wherever

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.600 
it'll actually lock the color wherever
they<00:03:27.230> are<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:27.680> if<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:27.920> like<00:03:28.070> yours<00:03:28.340> being

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
they are so if you like yours being

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.820 
they are so if you like yours being
orange<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.840> guess<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.380> could<00:03:30.410> leave<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.800> like

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
orange I guess you could leave it like

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:40.250 
orange I guess you could leave it like
that<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.860> can<00:03:34.010> also<00:03:34.630> cut<00:03:35.630> them<00:03:35.750> all<00:03:35.840> off

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.320 

so<00:03:40.860> that's<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> Nighthawk<00:03:41.549> collar<00:03:41.790> not<00:03:42.060> too

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
so that's the Nighthawk collar not too

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.580 
so that's the Nighthawk collar not too
bad<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.599> don't<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.930> any<00:03:43.140> other<00:03:43.319> computer

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
bad I don't have any other computer

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.890 
bad I don't have any other computer
cases<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.220> compare<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.849> but<00:03:45.299> I'm<00:03:45.599> pleased

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
cases to compare it to but I'm pleased

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.409 
cases to compare it to but I'm pleased
with<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.200> one
