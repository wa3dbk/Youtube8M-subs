00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I did play for 424 discord because I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
I did play for 424 discord because I
felt<00:00:50.129> those<00:00:50.250> best<00:00:50.460> formation<00:00:51.000> forgiving<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

players they had they'd no outstanding

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670 
players they had they'd no outstanding
