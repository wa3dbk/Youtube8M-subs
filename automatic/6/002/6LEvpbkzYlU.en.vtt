at<00:00:40.860> first<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> thought<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:42.989> way<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
at first I thought there is no way you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
at first I thought there is no way you
can<00:00:43.500> add<00:00:43.680> additional<00:00:43.860> action<00:00:44.460> bars<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
can add additional action bars but that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
can add additional action bars but that
is<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.300> true<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
is not true all you have to do is go to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.729 
is not true all you have to do is go to
your<00:00:46.920> interface<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.629> vanilla<00:00:49.170> action

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

makes it look rather neat so my opinion

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.430 
makes it look rather neat so my opinion
on<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.489> UI<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.060> very<00:02:10.390> good<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.170> UI

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
on this UI is a very good one this UI

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.699 
on this UI is a very good one this UI
looks<00:02:12.040> very<00:02:12.459> pretty<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.420> very<00:02:13.780> stylized<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.250 
looks very pretty it's very stylized and
it's<00:02:14.890> also<00:02:15.160> very<00:02:15.519> functional<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.540> think<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
it's also very functional I think the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.410 
it's also very functional I think the
addition<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.860> cool<00:02:18.280> line<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> good<00:02:19.209> one

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420

because<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.840> think<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.230> fits<00:02:20.590> with<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.370> theme

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800 
because I think it fits with the theme
