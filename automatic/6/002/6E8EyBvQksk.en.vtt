00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.930 
the German Grand Prix are you last year
and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> thought<00:00:48.540> I'm<00:00:48.660> gonna<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.960> round<00:00:49.140> yeah

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
and I thought I'm gonna go round yeah

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
and I thought I'm gonna go round yeah
get<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.690> these<00:00:51.840> massive<00:00:52.470> jumps

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
get there and I got these massive jumps

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.450 
get there and I got these massive jumps
and<00:00:53.540> but<00:00:54.540> having<00:00:55.260> said<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> see

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and but having said that as you can see

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.100 
and but having said that as you can see
I<00:00:56.490> think<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> kids<00:00:57.090> probably<00:00:57.240> prefer<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
I think the kids probably prefer it I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.360 
I think the kids probably prefer it I
think<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.680> probably<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.010> they'd<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.310> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
think that's probably what they'd like a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.729 
think that's probably what they'd like a
real<00:00:59.640> f1<00:00:59.970> race<00:01:00.150> to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.570> yeah<00:01:00.810> yeah<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
real f1 race to be like yeah yeah the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
real f1 race to be like yeah yeah the
loops<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.280> leave<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.820> loops<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> can

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
loops and leave the loops and all I can

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170 
loops and leave the loops and all I can
like<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.290> crazy<00:01:04.589> skidding<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.940> never

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like just crazy skidding and they never

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.770 
like just crazy skidding and they never
done<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.200> taken<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> f1<00:01:08.369> formula<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.940> sort

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
done it's taken the f1 formula and sort

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.109 
done it's taken the f1 formula and sort
of<00:01:09.810> injected<00:01:10.500> Mario<00:01:10.830> Kart<00:01:11.130> sort<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> type<00:01:11.850> kart

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
of injected Mario Kart sort of type kart

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.639 
of injected Mario Kart sort of type kart
racing<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.690> four<00:01:12.869> players<00:01:13.050> so<00:01:13.500> we've

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
racing and so it's four players so we've

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:14.660 
racing and so it's four players so we've
all<00:01:13.740> been<00:01:13.860> four<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.190> us<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.369> been<00:01:14.490> playing

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
all been four of us have been playing

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600 
all been four of us have been playing
together<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.440> was<00:01:16.710> quite<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.399> try

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
together and it was quite a lot to try

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
together and it was quite a lot to try
to<00:01:17.670> help<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> players<00:01:18.300> behind<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.899> catch<00:01:19.050> up

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to help the players behind to catch up

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.300 
to help the players behind to catch up
so<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.770> make<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.220> bit

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so as well as make them a little bit

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
so as well as make them a little bit
faster<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.600> gives<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:21.930> better

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
faster it also gives them better

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.139 
faster it also gives them better
power-ups<00:01:22.649> so<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.670> you've<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.910> younger

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
power-ups so if you've got younger

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.300 
power-ups so if you've got younger
members<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> family<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.409> works<00:01:25.740> try<00:01:26.190> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
members of the family it works try and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.260 
members of the family it works try and
include<00:01:26.490> them<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.760> what's<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.120> I<00:01:27.210> think

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
include them in what's going on I think

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.390 

they've<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.680> said<00:02:34.890> they're<00:02:35.130> really<00:02:35.220> enjoying

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
they've all said they're really enjoying

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.900 
they've all said they're really enjoying
it<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.360> think<00:02:37.350> when<00:02:38.220> you've<00:02:38.340> had<00:02:38.520> enough<00:02:38.580> of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
it I think when you've had enough of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.460 
it I think when you've had enough of
playing<00:02:39.120> like<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> formula<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.320> your<00:02:40.440> own

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
playing like the formula one on your own

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.280 
playing like the formula one on your own
and<00:02:40.770> being<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.010> bit<00:02:41.190> hardcore<00:02:41.790> racer<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:43.110> this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
and being a bit hardcore racer then this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
and being a bit hardcore racer then this
is<00:02:43.470> something<00:02:43.740> which<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.460> actually

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
is something which you can actually

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
is something which you can actually
still<00:02:45.030> pretend<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.870> you're<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.470> know

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
still pretend that you're you know

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.320 
still pretend that you're you know
having<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.370> bit<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.550> f1<00:02:47.850> yeah<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.240> you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
having a little bit of f1 yeah so you

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.740 
having a little bit of f1 yeah so you
pay<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.660> pay<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.930> f1<00:02:49.380> 2011<00:02:50.310> 2012<00:02:50.910> game<00:02:51.270> yeah

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
pay you pay the f1 2011 2012 game yeah

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.170 
pay you pay the f1 2011 2012 game yeah
which<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.200> proper<00:02:52.620> serious<00:02:53.280> simulation

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
which is the proper serious simulation

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.180 
which is the proper serious simulation
so<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.360> should<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.600> exactly<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.050> anyways<00:02:55.860> but

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
so it should be exactly like anyways but

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.770 
so it should be exactly like anyways but
it's<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.520> accessible<00:02:56.910> yeah<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.630> it's<00:02:57.750> not

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it's not accessible yeah so it's not

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's not accessible yeah so it's not
ideal<00:02:57.990> for<00:02:58.200> kids<00:02:58.320> no<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:58.800> no

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
ideal for kids no there's no

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
ideal for kids no there's no
split-screen<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.370> think<00:02:59.550> actually<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.850> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
split-screen I think actually in the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.950 
split-screen I think actually in the
latest<00:03:00.120> game<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.810> play<00:03:00.900> two

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
latest game is it that you can play two

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.410 
latest game is it that you can play two
player<00:03:01.290> split-screen<00:03:01.620> okay<00:03:02.240> but<00:03:03.240> it's<00:03:03.330> not

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
player split-screen okay but it's not

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.949 
player split-screen okay but it's not
the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.630> people

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the same people

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.750 
the same people
so<00:03:04.470> all<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.800> no<00:03:04.980> ladles<00:03:05.340> are<00:03:05.430> licensed

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so all that no ladles are licensed

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.160 
so all that no ladles are licensed
saying<00:03:06.000> okay<00:03:06.330> all<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.570> background<00:03:06.810> in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
saying okay all that background in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.600 
saying okay all that background in
actually<00:03:07.440> creating<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.739> proper<00:03:08.070> racing<00:03:08.250> game

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
actually creating a proper racing game

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.830 
actually creating a proper racing game
it's<00:03:08.880> gone<00:03:08.970> into<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.209> that's<00:03:09.420> what<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.570> quite

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's gone into this that's what I quite

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.110 
it's gone into this that's what I quite
like<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.830> numerical<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.700> fine<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.030> if

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
like the numerical it's fine but if

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.160 
like the numerical it's fine but if
you're<00:03:12.209> not<00:03:12.270> care<00:03:12.510> if<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:12.989> about

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
you're not care if it's just all about

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.990 
you're not care if it's just all about
what<00:03:13.350> power-ups<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.580> felt<00:03:14.850> like

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
what power-ups you get and it felt like

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.350 
what power-ups you get and it felt like
this<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.239> more<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.600> erasers<00:03:16.320> kart<00:03:16.680> game<00:03:16.890> yes

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
this is more of a erasers kart game yes

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.610 
this is more of a erasers kart game yes
yes<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.480> once<00:03:18.660> you've<00:03:18.810> finished<00:03:18.989> paying<00:03:19.350> or

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
yes so once you've finished paying or

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020 
yes so once you've finished paying or
had<00:03:19.800> enough<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> multiplayer<00:03:20.489> there's<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
had enough of the multiplayer there's a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.120 
had enough of the multiplayer there's a
queer<00:03:21.270> mode<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.600> well<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.890> take<00:03:23.100> a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
queer mode as well so you can take a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.300 
queer mode as well so you can take a
single<00:03:23.400> racer<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.420> work<00:03:24.780> them<00:03:24.959> through<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
single racer and work them through a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.410 
single racer and work them through a
career<00:03:26.310> track<00:03:26.640> where<00:03:27.150> they're<00:03:27.239> getting

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
career track where they're getting

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.690 
career track where they're getting
better<00:03:27.540> cars<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.230> actual<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.190> stats<00:03:29.489> of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
better cars and the actual the stats of

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.430 
better cars and the actual the stats of
the<00:03:29.790> racer<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.330> proving<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.020> saying<00:03:31.230> because

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the racer I'm proving and saying because

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.040 
the racer I'm proving and saying because
they're<00:03:31.709> cars<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.220> think<00:03:32.510> maybe<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.840> mean

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
they're cars you think maybe what I mean

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.780 
they're cars you think maybe what I mean
maybe<00:03:34.620> time<00:03:34.920> would<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.370> yeah

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
maybe time would really like that yeah

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.310 
maybe time would really like that yeah
it<00:03:36.030> still<00:03:36.270> be<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> current<00:03:36.690> racing<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.110> yeah

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
it still be a current racing game yeah

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.710 
it still be a current racing game yeah
but<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.580> give<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.000> reason<00:03:39.360> if

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
but it was to give you that reason if

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.460 
but it was to give you that reason if
you're<00:03:39.840> anything<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.200> your<00:03:40.290> own

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
gives you the meat of the game on you

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.670 
gives you the meat of the game on you
yeah<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.750> mean<00:03:45.870> like<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.110> America<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:46.650> not

if<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.830> anything<00:03:55.980> like<00:03:56.070> merica<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.910> gets

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
if it's anything like merica and it gets

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.210 
if it's anything like merica and it gets
addictive<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.780> timings<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.590> laps

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
addictive on the timings of the laps

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.640 
addictive on the timings of the laps
they're<00:03:59.519> not<00:03:59.670> used<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:02.630> as<00:04:03.630> well<00:04:03.870> yeah<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:04.500> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
they're not used to as well yeah so that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.050 
they're not used to as well yeah so that
I<00:04:04.680> think<00:04:04.800> that<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.280> could<00:04:05.519> get<00:04:05.700> highly

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060

addicted<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.680> go<00:04:07.770> any<00:04:07.920> kind<00:04:08.010> of

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160
