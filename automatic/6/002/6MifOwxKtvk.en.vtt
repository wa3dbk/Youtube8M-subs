00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello you love as promised 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.050
 now the video about the festival 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.120
 survival tips especially for 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 vegan and especially for vegan because 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 This is also a three-part one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.609
 please, and indeed, the three parts 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 are first time I so 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.390
 take what enters eat technically 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
 the monument to both genders very much 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.600
 interesting then what I clothing excessively 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 take 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 which is rather uninteresting there 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 really bad weather is and me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 the not so fashionable things somehow 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 He's so easy with takers 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 functional things warm things and so on 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.350
 and the third part will be what then 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 I come to take cosmetics moderately with me 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 Of course I will not take that much 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 that's just a festival just like that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 couple stuff around me myself 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 to feel a little bit better and with it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 Let's start now how much 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 that's exactly what I call technically 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.079
 with that once that show up 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.879
 I have ice hockey in the last time 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.379
 Enocean then showed the spelled waffles 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.210
 I find that between hunger then have 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.830
 I have tea and my daily 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.479
 I took it for the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 I have decided on green fresh tea 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.330
 once again turned to it also gets 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.420
 soon something fresh and indeed practical and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.939
 banal but I think they hold the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 Keep up quite good is kitchen roll 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.369

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 small part of dink with detergent 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.509
 I have made garlic and salt here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.979

 You should always use tea towels 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.140
 have along 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:19.970
 still such a swarm to clean up 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.010
 patties and sausages 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.840
 here are such little ones such a small one 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.380

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.690
 with it 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.950
 The toothpicks are mainly for 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 most of the ones I take with me 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.260
 I also have vegetables on July 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.910

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.380
 actually a cutlery us something in it 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.459
 that means different bowls and 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.910
 knife opener and nothing anyway 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.470
 special and quite often I have 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.390
 here is a larger bag the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.980
 Cooler bag and there I still have to alcoa 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.530
 chocolate milk inside and out of the rice 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.790
 milk and this also without sugar so the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.410
 Farmers really perfect because too 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.450
 to eat in the morning so first 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.230
 but here you can still cool so 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.519
 I once limp myself technically 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.299
 still a little camping matter 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.430
 bought and thus meaning that 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.540
 the niso part of the bottom and above 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.310
 I would be such a big one here 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.900
 gymnastics mat that is just thicker 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.700
 Yes back problems that's why I have there 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.200
 I took what then 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.910
 a sleeping bag I bought I just have 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.070
 none had the offer in 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.019
 holland then i have that here and 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.579
 pillow and there is a blanket inside the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.320
 were right and I already have 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.420
 qvc the love are really nice 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.790
 soft and fluffy that's why it comes 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.579
 even more and a big fat one 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.810
 Pillow what so memory hardly has in it because 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.519
 I just have back problems and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.709
 somehow my head a bit too 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.880
 should be supported yes and then 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.560
 we are also getting tough with the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.459
 Clothes were very much less 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.810
 spectacular 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.690
 These are really a big one here 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.730

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.709
 even a thicker sweatpants some 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.540
 leggins I think that the most comfortable one 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.030
 can not pull down some shirts 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.940

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.079
 With that I will sleep eating a suit 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.940
 just another bikini somehow 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.440
 is pretty washed out when I'm there 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.030
 That's why it wants to go showering 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.379
 behind the flip flops and mine 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.620
