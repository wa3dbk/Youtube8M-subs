00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.040 

a<00:00:09.110> few<00:00:10.040> notes<00:00:10.220> on<00:00:10.460> the<00:00:10.910> nature<00:00:11.240> of<00:00:11.270> vibration

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
a few notes on the nature of vibration

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.920 
a few notes on the nature of vibration
the<00:00:12.980> reciprocating<00:00:13.550> engines<00:00:14.030> and<00:00:14.270> single

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
the reciprocating engines and single

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.020 
the reciprocating engines and single
cylinder<00:00:15.260> engines<00:00:15.710> in<00:00:15.860> particular<00:00:16.430> have

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030 
cylinder engines in particular have

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.410 
cylinder engines in particular have
inherent<00:00:17.660> imbalance<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.029> imbalance<00:00:20.029> causes

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
inherent imbalance and imbalance causes

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.380 
inherent imbalance and imbalance causes
things<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.869> shake<00:00:21.310> shaking<00:00:22.310> requires<00:00:22.880> energy

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
things to shake shaking requires energy

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.409 
things to shake shaking requires energy
so<00:00:24.380> when<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:24.650> have<00:00:24.800> imbalance<00:00:25.400> we<00:00:25.910> have<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.119> loss

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
so when we have imbalance we have a loss

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.080 
so when we have imbalance we have a loss
of<00:00:26.630> power<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.740> power<00:00:27.950> goes<00:00:28.279> into<00:00:28.310> shaking

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
of power the power goes into shaking

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.350 
of power the power goes into shaking
things<00:00:29.419> of<00:00:30.259> course<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:31.040> best<00:00:31.360> conservation

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
things of course the best conservation

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.970 
things of course the best conservation
of<00:00:32.419> power<00:00:32.660> in<00:00:32.900> a<00:00:32.960> case<00:00:33.170> like<00:00:33.350> this<00:00:33.410> is<00:00:33.800> to

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
of power in a case like this is to

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.060 
of power in a case like this is to
restrain<00:00:34.460> things<00:00:34.850> from<00:00:35.270> vibrating<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:36.770> force

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
restrain things from vibrating the force

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.220 
restrain things from vibrating the force
is<00:00:37.310> still<00:00:37.520> there<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.570> if<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.780> force<00:00:39.020> isn't

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
is still there but if a force isn't

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.860 
is still there but if a force isn't
dissipated<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.220> shaking<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.820> object<00:00:41.239> there

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
dissipated and shaking the object there

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.479 
dissipated and shaking the object there
is<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.019> chance<00:00:42.350> you'll<00:00:42.620> save<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.039> little<00:00:43.280> bit<00:00:43.399> of

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
is a chance you'll save a little bit of

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.939 
is a chance you'll save a little bit of
power<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.120> maybe<00:00:44.660> even<00:00:44.930> print<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.350> where<00:00:45.649> and

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
power and maybe even print and where and

noise to some degree I have air pressure
connected<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:48.920> I've<00:00:49.100> got<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.370> hose<00:00:49.519> pinched

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
connected here I've got the hose pinched

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.250 
connected here I've got the hose pinched
off<00:00:50.179> let's<00:00:50.750> see<00:00:51.050> oh<00:00:51.289> we<00:00:52.190> want<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.429> talk<00:00:52.519> about

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
off let's see oh we want to talk about

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.950 
off let's see oh we want to talk about
resonance<00:00:54.260> critical<00:00:55.160> vibration<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:56.600> as

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
resonance critical vibration that is as

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
resonance critical vibration that is as
things<00:00:57.230> come<00:00:57.500> up<00:00:57.649> through<00:00:57.949> certain<00:00:58.339> speeds<00:00:58.699> or

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
things come up through certain speeds or

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.880 
things come up through certain speeds or
reciprocation<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.850> vibrating<00:01:02.359> force

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
reciprocation of the vibrating force

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.130 
reciprocation of the vibrating force
depending<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.220> mass<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.540> attachment

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
depending on the mass and the attachment

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.800 
depending on the mass and the attachment
of<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> object<00:01:06.710> that's<00:01:07.190> affected<00:01:07.760> you'll<00:01:08.570> get

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
of the object that's affected you'll get

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.330 
of the object that's affected you'll get
a<00:01:08.840> critical<00:01:09.320> vibration<00:01:09.860> you'll<00:01:10.010> see<00:01:10.159> what<00:01:10.310> I

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
a critical vibration you'll see what I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.740 
a critical vibration you'll see what I
mean<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.730> moment<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:11.090> have<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.450> engine

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
mean in a moment I have the engine

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.860 
mean in a moment I have the engine
blocked<00:01:12.530> up<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:13.010> fluffy<00:01:13.730> paper<00:01:14.150> towels<00:01:14.540> so

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
blocked up on fluffy paper towels so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.490 
blocked up on fluffy paper towels so
that<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.110> can<00:01:15.260> shake<00:01:15.560> freely<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:21.020> there<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.350> are

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
that it can shake freely so there we are

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.410 
that it can shake freely so there we are
I've<00:01:21.770> got<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.160> hose<00:01:22.340> pinched<00:01:22.820> off<00:01:22.970> most<00:01:23.300> of

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
I've got the hose pinched off most of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.260 
I've got the hose pinched off most of
the<00:01:23.510> way<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.440> it's<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.680> ticking<00:01:25.010> over<00:01:25.270> let's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
the way so it's just ticking over let's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.550 
the way so it's just ticking over let's
see<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.480> we<00:01:26.600> can<00:01:26.750> make<00:01:26.870> you<00:01:26.990> go<00:01:27.140> find<00:01:27.440> a

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
see if we can make you go find a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.950 
see if we can make you go find a
critical<00:01:28.280> resonance<00:01:28.940> its<00:01:29.480> increase<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
critical resonance its increase the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.480 
critical resonance its increase the
speed<00:01:30.140> gradually

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.109 

and<00:01:35.920> there's<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.100> first<00:01:37.340> major<00:01:37.670> resonance

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
and there's the first major resonance

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.690 
and there's the first major resonance
point

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.760 

two<00:01:44.329> laterals<00:01:44.810> back<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.350> back<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.710> forth

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
two laterals back to back and forth

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.560 
two laterals back to back and forth
motion<00:01:46.399> now<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.299> we<00:01:47.450> speed<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:47.930> up<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
motion now as we speed it up the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.050 
motion now as we speed it up the
disturbing<00:01:51.079> forces<00:01:51.350> get<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:52.460> be<00:01:52.549> faster<00:01:53.030> than

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
disturbing forces get to be faster than

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.240 
disturbing forces get to be faster than
the<00:01:53.240> resonance<00:01:54.200> period<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.799> weight<00:01:55.009> the

full<00:02:07.130> right

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.000 

that's<00:02:10.830> about

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that's about

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.720 
that's about
30<00:02:12.610> psi<00:02:13.150> as<00:02:13.300> opposed<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.830> engine<00:02:15.129> has<00:02:15.280> silent

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
bearings and that's why you don't hear

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.860 
bearings and that's why you don't hear
much<00:02:17.110> noise<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.700> vibrating<00:02:19.120> force<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.629> still

much noise the vibrating force is still

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.170 
much noise the vibrating force is still
here<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.129> not<00:02:21.310> moving<00:02:21.670> things<00:02:22.030> as

finger<00:02:26.349> on<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:27.269> get<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.299> heavy<00:02:28.540> slapping

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
finger on this I get a heavy slapping

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.809 
finger on this I get a heavy slapping
sensation<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.739> vibration<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.370> still<00:02:30.580> there

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
sensation the vibration is still there

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.910 
sensation the vibration is still there
just<00:02:30.849> isn't<00:02:31.299> making<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.049> thing<00:02:32.319> dance<00:02:32.650> like

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
just isn't making the thing dance like

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.339 
just isn't making the thing dance like
it<00:02:33.040> was<00:02:33.250> at<00:02:34.000> its<00:02:34.180> critical<00:02:34.629> eye<00:02:34.720> position<00:02:37.349> when

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
it was at its critical eye position when

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.520 
it was at its critical eye position when
there's<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.680> critical<00:02:39.069> vibration<00:02:40.530> idea

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
there's the critical vibration idea

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.080 
there's the critical vibration idea
there's<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.860> critical<00:02:42.280> speed<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.760> course<00:02:42.970> if

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
there's the critical speed of course if

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.050 
there's the critical speed of course if
the<00:02:43.180> engine<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.569> mounted<00:02:43.989> solidly<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.940> you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the engine is mounted solidly and you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.059 
the engine is mounted solidly and you
aren't<00:02:46.180> going<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.390> see<00:02:46.599> this<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.860> power

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
aren't going to see this and the power

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.680 
aren't going to see this and the power
that's<00:02:48.310> being<00:02:48.430> wasted<00:02:48.730> right<00:02:49.090> now<00:02:49.299> by<00:02:49.510> this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
that's being wasted right now by this

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.039 
that's being wasted right now by this
moving<00:02:50.170> back<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.590> forth<00:02:51.599> will<00:02:52.599> be<00:02:52.690> largely

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
moving back and forth will be largely

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.400 
moving back and forth will be largely
saved

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.030 

okay<00:02:57.070> there<00:02:57.400> we<00:02:57.490> go<00:02:57.850> enough<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.630> that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
okay there we go enough of that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.040 
okay there we go enough of that
vibration

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
vibration

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.010
