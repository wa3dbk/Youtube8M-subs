unexpected move it stabbed it should do

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.940

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and I know I can't probably kill it in

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
and I know I can't probably kill it in
one<00:01:17.790> hit<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.390> banded<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.110> I'll<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.409> how

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
one hit but it is banded so I'll see how

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
one hit but it is banded so I'll see how
much<00:01:19.590> damage<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.729> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
much damage I can do and see what this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.670 
much damage I can do and see what this
as<00:01:21.000> Romero<00:01:21.299> locks<00:01:21.600> himself<00:01:21.810> into<00:01:22.290> since<00:01:22.500> most

as Romero locks himself into since most

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
as Romero locks himself into since most
as<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.040> mayor<00:01:23.189> rolls<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> choice<00:01:23.700> banded<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
as your mayor rolls of choice banded and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.480 
as your mayor rolls of choice banded and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
he goes from a giga impact which really

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
he goes from a giga impact which really
surprised<00:01:26.939> me<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> whole<00:01:27.659> lot<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.900> um<00:01:28.229> as

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
surprised me not a whole lot of um as

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
surprised me not a whole lot of um as
you<00:01:28.729> Merrill's<00:01:29.729> carry<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> figure

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you Merrill's carry that so I figure

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
you Merrill's carry that so I figure

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it's like free setup fodder so I'm going

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
it's like free setup fodder so I'm going

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to bronze on but this bronzong happen to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.880 
to bronze on but this bronzong happen to
have<00:01:47.700> reflect<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.899> he<00:01:49.020> sets<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> reflect

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
have reflect so he sets up the reflect

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950

as<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.159> trying<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> focus<00:01:50.640> punch<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.689> means

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
as I'm trying to focus punch which means

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.139 
as I'm trying to focus punch which means
focus<00:01:52.799> punch<00:01:52.950> won't<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> whole<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
focus punch won't do a whole lot to
bronzong<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> hit<00:01:55.799> him<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.460> less

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
bronzong so I hit him and it does less

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
bronzong so I hit him and it does less
than<00:01:57.030> half<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.020> does<00:01:58.259> de<00:01:58.469> does<00:01:58.829> actually

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
than half well it does de does actually

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.039 
than half well it does de does actually
more<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.460> expected<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.180> actually

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
more than I expected it to do actually

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
more than I expected it to do actually
but<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:02.009> less<00:02:02.130> than<00:02:02.310> half<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> I'm

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
here and he breaks my sub simply because

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.770 
here and he breaks my sub simply because
um<00:02:52.480> now<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.230> has<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.409> swords<00:02:54.310> dance<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.389> go

for<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.959> focus<00:02:56.290> punch<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.680> he<00:02:56.739> decides<00:02:57.010> not

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
for the focus punch and he decides not

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.770 
for the focus punch and he decides not
to<00:02:57.459> set<00:02:57.609> up<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.790> reflect<00:02:58.120> again<00:02:58.359> which<00:02:58.540> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
to set up the reflect again which you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.360 
to set up the reflect again which you
probably<00:02:59.079> should<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.650> he<00:02:59.859> should<00:02:59.889> have<00:03:00.069> set

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
probably should have he should have set

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.369 
probably should have he should have set
up<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.549> reflect<00:03:00.879> their<00:03:01.090> again<00:03:01.359> because<00:03:01.720> even

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
up the reflect their again because even

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.800 
up the reflect their again because even
if<00:03:02.500> bronzong<00:03:02.919> died<00:03:03.189> in<00:03:03.370> two<00:03:03.519> turns<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.120> mean<00:03:04.720> at

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
if bronzong died in two turns I mean at

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.179 
if bronzong died in two turns I mean at
least<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.109> would<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.379> reflect<00:03:05.799> up<00:03:05.980> for

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
least you would have a reflect up for

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.280 
least you would have a reflect up for
his<00:03:06.280> neck<00:03:06.400> pokemon<00:03:06.879> but<00:03:07.659> he<00:03:07.780> doesn't<00:03:08.139> and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
his neck pokemon but he doesn't and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.720 
his neck pokemon but he doesn't and
instead<00:03:08.590> he<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:08.709> breaks<00:03:09.099> my<00:03:09.220> sub<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.519> goes

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
instead he just breaks my sub and goes

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.280 
instead he just breaks my sub and goes
no<00:03:09.879> Luke<00:03:10.090> which<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.629> good<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.959> forcing

he'll lock himself into and he locks
himself<00:03:17.079> into<00:03:17.500> psychic<00:03:17.889> which<00:03:18.639> doesn't<00:03:19.000> quite

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
himself into psychic which doesn't quite

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.059 
himself into psychic which doesn't quite
kill<00:03:19.419> me<00:03:19.540> cuz<00:03:20.109> like<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:20.409> said<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.680> pollito

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
kill me cuz like i said this pollito

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.229 
kill me cuz like i said this pollito
special<00:03:21.579> wall<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:23.049> um<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.699> a<00:03:24.729> to<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> KO

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
special wall but um it it is a to a KO

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.930 
special wall but um it it is a to a KO
so<00:03:25.569> there<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.840> go<00:03:25.949> I<00:03:26.949> probably<00:03:27.549> should<00:03:27.790> have

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
so there you go I probably should have

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.539 
so there you go I probably should have
just<00:03:28.090> went<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.299> tyranitar<00:03:28.930> now<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:30.340> yeah<00:03:30.519> I

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
just went to tyranitar now but yeah I

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.589 
just went to tyranitar now but yeah I
probably<00:03:30.729> should<00:03:30.879> have<00:03:31.000> went<00:03:31.150> into<00:03:31.269> it's<00:03:31.419> a

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
probably should have went into it's a

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.300 
probably should have went into it's a
politoed<00:03:32.049> for<00:03:32.199> later<00:03:32.349> but<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.620> guess<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.280> just

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
politoed for later but I guess I just

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.219 
politoed for later but I guess I just
didn't<00:03:33.729> so<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.879> go<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.090> at<00:03:34.239> ever<00:03:34.389> antar<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.989> he

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
didn't so I go in at ever antar and he

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.689 
didn't so I go in at ever antar and he
has<00:03:35.319> to<00:03:35.440> switch<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.859> he's<00:03:36.280> locked<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.579> a

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
has to switch because he's locked in a

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.420 
has to switch because he's locked in a
psychic<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:37.930> go<00:03:38.260> for<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.500> dragon<00:03:38.949> dance<00:03:39.159> and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
psychic so I go for the dragon dance and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.520 
psychic so I go for the dragon dance and
because<00:03:40.299> i<00:03:40.359> know<00:03:40.419> he's<00:03:40.659> locked<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.139> psychic

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
because i know he's locked in a psychic

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.819 
because i know he's locked in a psychic
and<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.669> free<00:03:43.060> set<00:03:43.900> up<00:03:44.019> for<00:03:44.199> me<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.590> i

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
and it's like a free set up for me and i

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.199 
and it's like a free set up for me and i
go<00:03:44.949> for<00:03:45.099> a<00:03:45.159> stone<00:03:45.310> age<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.579> i<00:03:45.609> miss<00:03:45.879> I'm<00:03:46.030> like

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
go for a stone age and i miss I'm like

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.869 
go for a stone age and i miss I'm like
come<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.859> now<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.099> Gliscor<00:03:48.519> goes<00:03:48.669> for<00:03:48.819> the

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
come on so now the Gliscor goes for the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.339 
come on so now the Gliscor goes for the
earthquake<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:49.750> super<00:03:50.049> effective

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
earthquake and that's super effective

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.819 
earthquake and that's super effective
and<00:03:51.810> ya<00:03:52.810> know<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:53.019> whole<00:03:53.139> lot<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:53.349> say<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:53.709> me

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
and ya know a whole lot to say it's me

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.490 
and ya know a whole lot to say it's me
down<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.159> 117<00:03:54.879> roughly<00:03:55.449> and<00:03:55.689> I'm<00:03:55.989> just<00:03:56.169> hoping

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
down to 117 roughly and I'm just hoping

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.369 
down to 117 roughly and I'm just hoping
my<00:03:56.680> other<00:03:56.859> stone<00:03:57.099> edge<00:03:57.280> will<00:03:57.459> hit<00:03:57.669> and<00:03:58.349> yeah<00:03:59.349> I

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
my other stone edge will hit and yeah I

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.439 
my other stone edge will hit and yeah I

thank<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.989> God<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:03.129> now<00:04:03.370> he<00:04:03.430> goes<00:04:03.729> back<00:04:04.180> into

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
thank you God so now he goes back into

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.719 
thank you God so now he goes back into
it<00:04:06.699> was<00:04:06.849> back<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.180> luke<00:04:07.479> and<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:08.859> know<00:04:09.340> they

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
it was back in a luke and I know they

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.789 
it was back in a luke and I know they
can<00:04:09.970> carry<00:04:10.209> vacuum<00:04:10.689> wave<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.079> most<00:04:11.259> bec<00:04:11.500> sets

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
can carry vacuum wave and most bec sets

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.740 
can carry vacuum wave and most bec sets
do<00:04:12.099> but<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:12.669> just<00:04:12.970> didn't<00:04:13.299> want<00:04:13.419> to<00:04:13.479> switch

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
do but I just didn't want to switch

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.960 
do but I just didn't want to switch
because<00:04:14.680> vacuum<00:04:15.129> wave<00:04:15.250> would<00:04:15.400> be<00:04:15.579> doing<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.939> lot

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
because vacuum wave would be doing a lot

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.390 
because vacuum wave would be doing a lot
to<00:04:16.269> my<00:04:16.479> team<00:04:16.750> anyway<00:04:17.139> so<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:17.979> goes<00:04:18.130> for<00:04:18.280> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to my team anyway so it goes for the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.580 
to my team anyway so it goes for the
vacuum<00:04:18.789> wave<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.509> it<00:04:19.570> kills<00:04:19.780> tyranitar<00:04:20.409> and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
vacuum wave and it kills tyranitar and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.800 
vacuum wave and it kills tyranitar and
that's<00:04:20.709> rather<00:04:20.919> sad<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:22.000> now<00:04:22.180> i<00:04:22.210> go<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.510> mince

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
that's rather sad so now i go to mince

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.129 
that's rather sad so now i go to mince
because<00:04:23.320> men's<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:24.130> take<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.520> and

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
because men's can take it and

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.499 
because men's can take it and
this<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.800> actually<00:04:26.129> my<00:04:26.219> really<00:04:26.879> really<00:04:26.909> cool

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
this is actually my really really cool

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.379 
this is actually my really really cool
mix<00:04:28.319> meds<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.490> yeah<00:04:29.759> you<00:04:29.819> decide<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.270> switch

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
mix meds so yeah you decide to switch

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.809 
mix meds so yeah you decide to switch
out<00:04:30.659> into<00:04:30.870> vaporeon<00:04:31.469> and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.400> go<00:04:32.580> for<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
out into vaporeon and I go for the

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.269 
out into vaporeon and I go for the
earthquake<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.569> this<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.409> a<00:04:34.439> physically

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:35.279 
earthquake and this is a physically

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.219 
earthquake and this is a physically
bulky<00:04:35.699> vaporeon<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.509> the<00:04:36.629> earthquake<00:04:36.960> doesn't

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
bulky vaporeon so the earthquake doesn't

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.779 
bulky vaporeon so the earthquake doesn't
do<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.349> whole<00:04:37.439> lot<00:04:37.590> but<00:04:38.009> hey<00:04:38.249> guys<00:04:38.490> that's

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
do a whole lot but hey guys that's

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.790 
do a whole lot but hey guys that's
what's<00:04:39.029> so<00:04:39.180> great<00:04:39.360> about<00:04:39.419> mix<00:04:39.840> meds<00:04:40.050> because

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
what's so great about mix meds because

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.260 
what's so great about mix meds because
there's<00:04:41.159> not<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> whole<00:04:41.460> lot<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.639> good<00:04:41.909> mixed

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
there's not a whole lot of good mixed

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.239 
there's not a whole lot of good mixed
walls<00:04:42.509> out<00:04:42.749> there<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.590> now<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:43.830> just<00:04:43.979> switch

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:44.249 
walls out there so now I can just switch

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.860 
walls out there so now I can just switch
the<00:04:44.279> type<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.639> my<00:04:44.849> move<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.360> I'm<00:04:45.599> just<00:04:45.689> going<00:04:45.810> to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
the type of my move so I'm just going to

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.899 
the type of my move so I'm just going to
go<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.139> Draco<00:04:46.379> meteor<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.400> vaporeon

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
go for the Draco meteor and the vaporeon

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.189 
go for the Draco meteor and the vaporeon
isn't<00:04:48.300> going<00:04:48.449> to<00:04:48.509> be<00:04:48.569> able<00:04:48.629> to<00:04:48.779> take<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.930> Draco

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
isn't going to be able to take a Draco

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.529 
isn't going to be able to take a Draco
meteor<00:04:49.409> so<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.550> vaporeon<00:04:51.029> goes<00:04:51.210> down<00:04:51.360> at<00:04:51.479> the

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
meteor so the vaporeon goes down at the

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.600
