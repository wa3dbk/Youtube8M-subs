 we are out a lot since I left 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.970
 and the level is more good that is higher 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.650
 then it is easier to learn 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.140
 descendant of a 100% Chilean family 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.210
 samantha nation usa in the state of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640

 He lived until he was 14 years old I was born in Miami 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 and he lived this year and then I came to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.940
 Chile because all my Chilean family 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 seven years and now 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 almost two years ago the Chilean 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.310
 American began to approach the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 basketball is why and for reasons 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.860
 relatives who returned miami 16 months that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.440
 I trained people doran academy I started 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.479
 melipilla playing a melipilla 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.450
 compaÃ±eras were also selected 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.210
 preselected and they talked to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 Ricardo told him that I was 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.340
 it measured a meter 96 that it receives 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.520
 starting and I did not know much good 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.680
 Ricardo sent for me and I came to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 prove me and told me is already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 we also want the little giant of the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.500
 National basketball could become 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.590
 in the new ziomara in fact both have 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 shared more than ever 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 almost two meters and even with the possibility 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 to keep growing a situation that does not 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.990
 bothers her in front of her classmates 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.390
 I'm normal, I feel normal at 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.180
 side of all the girls I've never 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.100
 meaning as well as rare to be high 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.030
 exposed but I like 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.130
 samantha are a Chilean team that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 will travel this November 17 to Venezuela 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.120
 to contest the South American championship 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.300
 of the category that will be notified from the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.800
 19th to the 23rd of this month a challenge 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.690
 important to her and her companions 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.030
 with which he trusts to make a great 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 discussion I think we have a good 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.290
 team 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.560
 what 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.719
 what we are going to achieve is going to be very good 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.359
 we expected to get to the gold to move to 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.950
 premundial and I think it's the 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.079
 rivals that we are playing are also 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.359
 very good the pivot back to miami a 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.530
 end the subcontinental tournament 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.720
 where the first three places get 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.280
 a quota the premundial sub 16 of the next 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.690
 year 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.250
 Samantha will have a few days of 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.020
 training to fit both the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 game systems like their peers 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.490
 although what is already final is that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.690
 it will undoubtedly be a very helpful weapon for 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.690
 the hit in the subcontinental tournament
