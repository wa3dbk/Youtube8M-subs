websites<00:00:17.029> cuz<00:00:18.029> some<00:00:18.449> people<00:00:18.750> might<00:00:18.930> use<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
websites cuz some people might use a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
websites cuz some people might use a
harder<00:00:20.460> software<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.320> sure<00:00:22.580> where<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
harder software but I'm not sure where a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.380 
harder software but I'm not sure where a
bypass<00:00:24.119> quite<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> few<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.119> it'll

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
bypass quite a few you can do this it'll

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
bypass quite a few you can do this it'll
probably<00:00:27.449> bypass<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> simple<00:00:28.619> ones<00:00:28.769> at

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
probably bypass the simple ones at

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.319 
probably bypass the simple ones at
school<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.519> work<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.489> instead

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
school or at work you do this by instead

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
school or at work you do this by instead
of<00:00:33.390> typing<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.079> web<00:00:34.230> address<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> sites

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of typing the web address of the sites

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.470 
of typing the web address of the sites
you<00:00:35.550> type<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> IP<00:00:36.620> address<00:00:38.000> now<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> may<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you type the IP address now you may be

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
you type the IP address now you may be
thinking<00:00:39.600> how<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> IP

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
thinking how do I find out the IP

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.500

find out the IP of a website by going
ping<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> need<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> type<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
ping and then you need to type the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.630 
ping and then you need to type the
website<00:01:39.140> web<00:01:40.140> address<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:40.770> let's<00:01:41.460> say

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
website web address which let's say

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.450 
website web address which let's say
we're<00:01:41.820> doing<00:01:41.909> Google<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:44.720> w-w-whoo

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
we're doing Google there we go w-w-whoo

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.200 
we're doing Google there we go w-w-whoo
comm<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.930> hit<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> enter<00:01:49.110> key<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
comm and hit the enter key and then you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.520 
comm and hit the enter key and then you
see<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.810> picking<00:01:52.350> W<00:01:53.390> google.com<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
see it's as picking W google.com then in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
see it's as picking W google.com then in
brackets<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.399> says<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> IP<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.610> need

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
brackets it says the IP so then you need

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.139 
brackets it says the IP so then you need
to<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.770> copy<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.219> there<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.520> put

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to go and copy that and there we go put

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
to go and copy that and there we go put
it<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.780> browser<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.680> using<00:02:07.740> Google

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it into your browser I'm using Google

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.940 
it into your browser I'm using Google
Chrome<00:02:08.610> at<00:02:08.849> them<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.530> come<00:02:10.800> up

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
Chrome at them and then it will come up

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.430 
Chrome at them and then it will come up
as<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> green<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.150> means<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.540> exists

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
as a green that means it exists

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.930 
as a green that means it exists
so<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.460> we<00:02:14.580> hit<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> enter<00:02:14.970> key<00:02:16.280> here<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.460> go

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
so then we hit the enter key here we go

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
so then we hit the enter key here we go
and<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:21.150> doesn't<00:02:21.600> say<00:02:21.720> ee<00:02:22.050> ee<00:02:22.320> ee<00:02:22.770> just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and then it doesn't say ee ee ee just

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.720 
and then it doesn't say ee ee ee just
says<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> IP<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.510> google<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.550> got

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
says the IP and it's google so we got

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.320 
says the IP and it's google so we got
google<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.690> using<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> IP<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.910> may<00:02:30.120> work

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
google just using the IP this may work

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.860 
google just using the IP this may work
on<00:02:30.540> most<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.770> simple<00:02:32.520> ones<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:32.940> school<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.810> at

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
on most the simple ones at school or at

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.520 
on most the simple ones at school or at
work<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:36.120> that's<00:02:36.360> how<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.500> all
