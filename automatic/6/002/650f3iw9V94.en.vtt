00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello everyone ruslan with you and today we 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 Consider German for t 6 level under 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.590
 dicker max and first we 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 install the equipment on the tank myself 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.930
 set camouflage net rammer 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.859
 and drive crosstalk but place the grid we can 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.699
 set also the stereo but this is already 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.450
 your choice in this tank is 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.250
 armor-piercing shells high-explosive and 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.840
 piercing shells this tank 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 the store is sold for only 3200 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.739
 gold tank strength is only 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.090
 550 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.730
 Hepe narrowly it shoots damage to 380 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.539
 armor piercing descent are very good and we 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 we can easily disassemble the tanks above 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.359
 its level can also start 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 shoot four times a minute but this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.799
 Depending on which crew 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 I have one hundred percent end of arable land 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.189
 yet 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.229
 but despite the cannon of this tank is very 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.930
 bad cardboard armor 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.320
 and an open wheelhouse although it provides 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 good review and this is the main advantage 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.600
 this tank just like i said before 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 if we put a stereo we have a review 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 increases to 500 meters and we just 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.829
 we will see well all our enemies 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.360
 also because of open cutting we suffer 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.680
 from high-explosive shells 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.890
 we can throw them or enemy 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.100
 art 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 well or other tanks so if you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 play this tank for you good 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.840
 tactic will this ambush hide in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 bushes and just helping your allies 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.170
 fire can even bend down enemy 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.360
 tanks are also dick this is a great tank 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.750
 support for our team 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.300
 we have 100 5 millimeters and weapons and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.300
 we can make out tanks until the eighth 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.270
 level well and the eighth level of course 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.610
 I also remember that the Germans do not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.800
 their accuracy is famous for their 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.300
 damage and when firing keep this in mind 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.950
 and of course I want to remind you that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.700
 projectiles if you shoot far they 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.140
 lose power better shoot bombs 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.400
 Dick has 26 dresses and I will say this to you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.370
 they are very expensive one shell costs 800 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.900
 silver for the fight we can shoot all 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.500
 their shells well, plus repair of course 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.750
 tank and that we can spend more 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.840
 on shells to repair the tank than 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.320
 the yield of this tank so morally 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.739
 get ready for this tank itself get well 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:12.660
 enough for myself silver playing buy i 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.180
 got up to 40,000 playing with no mind topic 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.930
 premium I don't know what will happen so 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.110
 it's up to you and think tank throws too 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.040
 in fights up to level eight but sometimes we 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.799
 We are in the top and we just can 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.190
 well win a fight if you can 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.320
 play german pt 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.470
 also the tank has a bad angle 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.510
 horizontal guidance and we will be on 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.150
 this tank to hit the target 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.370
 especially if she moves 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 turns a lot 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.209
 since the gun just can't do without 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.940
 without this, the very type of tank consists of 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.630
 five people and we can each 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.239
 pick up 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.299
 Well, if you have a special specialty 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.030
 already crew one hundred percent and you don't 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.560
 Well you know what profession swing 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.890
 swing the next one to the light bulb commander 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.900
 well, the rest is masking the tank itself 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.890
 shows itself well in quality 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.039
 simulator 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.829
 but the crew is fully compatible seconds 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.030
 panther 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.830
 I also do not forget to put quantum s2 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.990
 some equipment is like small 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.909
 first aid kit 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 repair kit and fire extinguisher 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:35.159
 although it is very rarely possible to replace 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.750
 gasoline or chocolate fire extinguisher 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.960
 also when i played this tank i 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.669
 got achievements so many times this 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.430
 armored a and arrow 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.969
 after each fight could not just not 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.080
 do without these achievements but we also 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:57.310
 can get a death defender's cashier and 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.060
 two medals is a fadin medal and a medal 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.330
 halo nena 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.750
 so choose you to buy it 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.840
 well or not to buy for yourself of course 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.289
 concluded that I play very badly on 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.110
 this tank was simply not difficult to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:18.039
 play him not concentrate on the fight 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.250
 well that's all i wanted to say i 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.340
 also said I saw what they wrote to me 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.370
 so I made a video about m3 stewart 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.099
 I will tell you Russian on such a tank 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.129
 I will not make a video this is a terrible tank 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:36.430
 its not something that does not sell its stores 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:40.180
 just give well, he just small 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.990
 levels behaves very bad well when 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.469
 I played on it and simply after heavy 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.870
 tanks to change him to play 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:53.710
 It makes no sense to it at the same rate of return 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:59.110
 little but i told you even i 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:03.310
 inside stewart and also remember what up 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.599
 Tomorrow there is an action where Valentine 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.380
 worth 500 gold you can buy it and 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.660
 roll a couple of dozen fights 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.690
