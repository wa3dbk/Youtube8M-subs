00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.120
 small video for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.480
 Farming Simulator 2015 at the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.309
 playstation 4 at gamescom and yes 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 First of all , I want you there a bit 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 actually mainly just the graphics 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.520
 show difference and the performance 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.680
 difference you can see here too 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 the exhaust it animates dust and so far 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 it really really works 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 good and so good that me 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 doubly muted really says yes 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 that's really really close to it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 the pc version 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 but a little bit is I know me 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 not if you like that in the video 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.680
 But it is sometimes easy to notice 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.890
 Edge flicker on so is not high 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.270
 Edge smoothing on the console and me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 I sometimes have the feeling that it is not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.210
 runs as smoothly as on the pc 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 The pc was really buttery and soft 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.940
 This is how it sometimes happens to me 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 bit hakelig ago 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 Of course that's a thing that the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 Developers have also said alright us 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 have to look a bit the consoles 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 do not pack that as well as good 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 the pcs that was actually clear 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 but the details became good again 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.710
 Apparently wanted to be implemented 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 just a little bit, really 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.760
 minimally saved but unfortunately there is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 there probably one or the other 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.310
 In any case, that can stutter me 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200
 play immediately 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.450
 I do not know if you have that in the video now 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340
 even so, but somehow perceives 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.369
 It was not as buttery as on the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 pc, unfortunately I have to say yes 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.590
 otherwise I will either today or 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.470
 tomorrow a video of this from 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.299
 show this gamescom stand and that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.009
 I will show the map there 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.500
 highlights from the mep and it will be 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.380
 I then all new known facts to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.329
 tell gamescom that are known to me 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 and that I could bring to experience 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.390
 yes, you can definitely do that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 ever look forward 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 otherwise also the direct textures 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 and that is the same content 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 the same vehicles the same maps 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.509
 because you must not have fear only 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 honestly, if you 're halfway 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.159
 I would have clever pc after this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 short year after this brief insight 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.439
 in the PSP version of a PC version 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.810
 Just buy it because it's a bit more 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.090
 possible if the most frequent switch 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.380
 graphics card you should do it all 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.820
 already at maximum play 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.580
 and then it looks much better 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.900
 and runs apparently also liquid yes 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 I'm out lights
