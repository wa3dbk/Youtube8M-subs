when you're editing this section you
have<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.129> B<00:00:50.969> C<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> D<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.250> when<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> hit<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.460> a

have a B C and D so when you hit on a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
have a B C and D so when you hit on a
it's<00:00:54.210> gonna<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> different<00:00:55.050> set<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:59.010> gonna

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's gonna be a different set it's gonna

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's gonna be a different set it's gonna
be<00:00:59.340> another<00:00:59.699> set<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> effects<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.780> whatever

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.030 
be another set of effects or whatever
you<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.619> B

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you put it right there and then also B

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.620 
you put it right there and then also B
is<00:01:05.159> gonna<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.880> set<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.330> C<00:01:06.510> is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is gonna be a different set the C is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.850 
is gonna be a different set the C is
gonna<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.900> different<00:01:07.140> cetera<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:07.830> just

gonna add a seat right now so like I
said<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.900> dealing<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.909> yeah<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970

can change the colors and all this kind
of<00:01:17.909> stuff<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> said<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.220> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of stuff and like I said that's this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.080 
of stuff and like I said that's this
after<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> press<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.840> view<00:01:22.200> button<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.939> can

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
after you press this view button you can

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
after you press this view button you can
go<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> started<00:01:25.979> making<00:01:26.100> these

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
go up here and started making these

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.730 
go up here and started making these
changes

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
changes

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.300 
changes
so<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.979> encoder<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.920> first

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
so your first the encoder is this first

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.960 
so your first the encoder is this first
night<00:01:38.869> then<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> court<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.439> coda<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
night then the court a coda to is the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.440 
night then the court a coda to is the
naked<00:01:42.360> next<00:01:42.750> 9-3<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> next<00:01:43.979> knob<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.240> on

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
naked next 9-3 and next knob and so on

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.700 
naked next 9-3 and next knob and so on
so<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> first

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so just like right now I have the first

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.569 
so just like right now I have the first
encoder<00:01:50.360> set<00:01:53.329> sets<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.710> change

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
encoder set sets a so I can change

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.990 
encoder set sets a so I can change
different<00:01:56.909> things<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:58.049> certain<00:01:58.710> effect<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
different things on a certain effect you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.090 
different things on a certain effect you
can<00:02:00.149> also<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:01.020> stuff<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.560> sins<00:02:02.119> use<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.299> for

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
can also do stuff with sins use it for

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.699 
can also do stuff with sins use it for
different<00:02:04.430> most<00:02:04.790> meaty<00:02:05.420> for<00:02:06.350> stuff<00:02:08.709> dynamics

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
different most meaty for stuff dynamics

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.320 
different most meaty for stuff dynamics
which<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.280> know<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:11.560> compressors<00:02:13.030> gate<00:02:14.030> or

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
which you know we compressors gate or

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.370 
which you know we compressors gate or
whatever<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.420> also<00:02:17.600> shows<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.110> that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
whatever so and it also shows you that

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.140 
whatever so and it also shows you that
like<00:02:18.920> if<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.250> click<00:02:19.520> on<00:02:19.700> that

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
like if I click on that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.640 
like if I click on that
get<00:02:20.660> us<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.959> gay<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> dynamics

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
get us a gay you know like the dynamics

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.710 
get us a gay you know like the dynamics
as<00:02:24.739> far<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.100> compressor<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:26.420> know<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
as far as the compressor you know the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.150 
as far as the compressor you know the
tact<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.380> hold<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.250> or<00:02:28.910> whatever<00:02:30.160> but

we're gonna do it fix so we're gonna go
we're<00:02:36.319> gonna<00:02:36.500> hit<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.860> Fix<00:02:37.280> button<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.920> we're

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
we're gonna hit the Fix button and we're

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.430 
we're gonna hit the Fix button and we're
gonna<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.370> mean<00:02:40.459> these<00:02:40.850> are<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.269> first<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
gonna I mean these are the first the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440 
gonna I mean these are the first the
face<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.769> they<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.130> up<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> board

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
face that they have up in in the board

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.990 
face that they have up in in the board
anyway<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.950> start<00:02:46.220> from<00:02:46.370> scratch

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
anyway so if you start from scratch

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.500 
anyway so if you start from scratch
alright<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.350> we're<00:02:48.950> gonna<00:02:49.100> set<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.239> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
alright so we're gonna set it to the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.500 
alright so we're gonna set it to the
delayed<00:02:50.840> which<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.470> our<00:02:51.860> bus<00:02:52.100> 15<00:02:52.670> which<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.000> mix

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
delayed which is our bus 15 which is mix

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.380 
delayed which is our bus 15 which is mix
15<00:02:53.930> or<00:02:54.170> whatever<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.830> wanna<00:02:55.010> call<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.390> all

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
15 or whatever you wanna call it all

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.840 
15 or whatever you wanna call it all
right<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.890> hit<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> View<00:02:58.340> button<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.760> go

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
right so you hit the View button and go

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.220 
right so you hit the View button and go
back<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.590> mode<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.910> know<00:03:02.239> which

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
back to this mode so now you know which

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.819 
back to this mode so now you know which
affect<00:03:03.709> you're<00:03:04.160> you're<00:03:05.080> you're<00:03:07.150> affecting

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
affect you're you're you're affecting

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.380 
affect you're you're you're affecting
because<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:11.570> your<00:03:11.690> effect<00:03:12.079> one<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
because that's your effect one the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.690 
because that's your effect one the
second<00:03:14.900> one<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.440> two<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.680> three<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.519> see

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
second one is just two and three you see

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.160 
second one is just two and three you see
the<00:03:16.820> numbers<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.390> sides<00:03:18.070> alright<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.900> I

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
the numbers on the sides alright so if I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.580 
the numbers on the sides alright so if I
want<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.470> affect<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:25.540> delay<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:27.140> we<00:03:27.290> had<00:03:27.440> on

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
want to affect the delay that we had on

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.240 
want to affect the delay that we had on
there<00:03:27.799> we<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:30.760> set<00:03:31.760> number<00:03:32.060> three<00:03:33.250> because

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
there we go to set number three because

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.349 
there we go to set number three because
that's<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.670> one<00:03:34.790> we're<00:03:35.000> trying<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.299> deal<00:03:35.510> with

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
that's the one we're trying to deal with

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.979 
that's the one we're trying to deal with
hit<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:39.040> then<00:03:40.239> from<00:03:41.239> there<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.780> can

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
hit that and then from there you can

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.229 
hit that and then from there you can
decide<00:03:42.410> if<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.950> want<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.220> if<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.850> want<00:03:44.000> that

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
decide if you want to if you want that

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.080 
decide if you want to if you want that
particular<00:03:44.420> knob<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.170> deal<00:03:45.380> with<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.680> mix<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
particular knob to deal with the mix the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.250 
particular knob to deal with the mix the
timing<00:03:47.660> on<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.470> mo<00:03:49.480> factor<00:03:50.480> level<00:03:50.840> factor

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
timing on it the mo factor level factor

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.880 
timing on it the mo factor level factor
right<00:03:51.440> I'll<00:03:52.160> set<00:03:52.579> whatever<00:03:53.180> feedback<00:03:53.890> all

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
right I'll set whatever feedback all

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.060 
right I'll set whatever feedback all
those<00:03:55.160> different<00:03:55.489> things<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:57.040> we're<00:03:58.040> just

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
those different things so we're just

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.309 
those different things so we're just
gonna<00:03:58.400> right<00:03:59.239> now<00:03:59.560> set<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.980> mix

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.039 

after<00:04:04.099> we<00:04:04.189> click<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:06.290> knife<00:04:06.530> or<00:04:06.829> show<00:04:06.980> up

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
after we click that the knife or show up

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.479 
after we click that the knife or show up
it'll<00:04:09.049> show<00:04:09.290> up<00:04:09.409> in<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.620> first<00:04:09.799> knob<00:04:10.129> saying

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
it'll show up in the first knob saying

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.929 
it'll show up in the first knob saying
mix<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.150> then<00:04:11.870> if<00:04:12.319> you're<00:04:12.769> turning<00:04:13.670> your

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
mix and then if you're turning your

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.699 
mix and then if you're turning your
knife<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:15.109> course

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
knife of course

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.990 
knife of course
that'll<00:04:16.639> change<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:19.130> but<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.489> have<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:19.729> much

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
that'll change you but I have a much

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.560 
that'll change you but I have a much
percent<00:04:20.479> on<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.079> want<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.970> the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
percent on it that you want then the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.150 
percent on it that you want then the
weight<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:24.110> said<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> way<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.710> get<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
weight we said the way you get to the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.499 
weight we said the way you get to the
second<00:04:25.520> encoder<00:04:25.759> just<00:04:26.150> scroll<00:04:26.389> down<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.889> then

second encoder just scroll down and then

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.999 
second encoder just scroll down and then
you<00:04:29.509> know<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> already<00:04:30.110> have<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.620> one<00:04:30.680> set<00:04:30.979> to

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
you know I already have that one set to

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.550 
you know I already have that one set to
time<00:04:31.370> or<00:04:31.729> whatever<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:33.050> how<00:04:33.259> you<00:04:33.320> will

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
time or whatever so that's how you will

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.879 
time or whatever so that's how you will
affect<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.090> knobs<00:04:35.110> now<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.470> go<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.680> the

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
set button five I wanted to the target

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.939 
set button five I wanted to the target
type<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.400> wanted<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.849> affect<00:04:56.289> you<00:04:57.289> know<00:04:59.949> their

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
particular thing so I would hit effect

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.200 
particular thing so I would hit effect
button<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.190> then<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:04.430> would<00:05:04.580> choose<00:05:04.759> which

effects like I wanted to do something to
my<00:05:09.289> my<00:05:09.740> delay<00:05:10.130> which<00:05:10.849> is<00:05:11.030> on<00:05:11.180> effect<00:05:11.479> 3<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:11.990> I

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
my my delay which is on effect 3 so I

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.529 
my my delay which is on effect 3 so I
hit<00:05:12.260> that<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:13.310> want<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.760> to<00:05:13.909> be<00:05:14.150> the

hit that and I want that to be the

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.960 
hit that and I want that to be the
timing<00:05:14.870> for<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.380> so<00:05:16.070> if<00:05:16.340> somebody's<00:05:16.789> thinking
