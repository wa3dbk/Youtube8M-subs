probably<00:03:40.450> spot<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.810> because<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.530> must<00:03:41.709> be

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
probably spot this because you must be

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.319 
probably spot this because you must be
spotting<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> lack<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.579> a<00:03:42.790> barracks<00:03:43.150> in

decided to hide something up there but

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.199 
decided to hide something up there but
he's<00:03:54.459> not<00:03:54.519> gonna<00:03:54.639> find<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:54.940> there<00:03:55.060> it's

actually right outside of his his main

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.300 
actually right outside of his his main
towards<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.579> middle<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.720> we'll<00:03:58.959> see<00:03:59.139> if

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
actually have range on the probe lon ah

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.900 
actually have range on the probe lon ah
but<00:05:20.210> he<00:05:20.740> reach<00:05:21.740> doesn't<00:05:22.160> kill<00:05:22.280> that<00:05:22.430> s<00:05:22.640> he<00:05:22.790> be

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
but he reach doesn't kill that s he be

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.840 
but he reach doesn't kill that s he be
repairing<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.390> barracks<00:05:23.830> but<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.370> Marines

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
repairing the barracks but but a Marines

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
and I don't think that's all can get

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.360 
and I don't think that's all can get
through<00:05:30.410> know<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.650> zealot<00:05:30.919> cannot<00:05:31.190> get

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
through know the zealot cannot get

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.030 
through know the zealot cannot get
through<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.880> barracks<00:05:32.630> blocks<00:05:32.930> so<00:05:33.200> box<00:05:33.830> are

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
through that barracks blocks so box are

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.380 
through that barracks blocks so box are
doing<00:05:34.190> something<00:05:34.430> very<00:05:34.460> interesting<00:05:34.940> here

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
doing something very interesting here

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.940 
doing something very interesting here
it's<00:05:35.720> really<00:05:35.900> using<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.470> map<00:05:36.590> locuras

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
it's really using the map locuras

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.890 
it's really using the map locuras
advantage<00:05:37.370> here<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:37.790> like<00:05:38.419> i<00:05:38.450> said<00:05:38.600> this<00:05:38.720> map

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
advantage here and like i said this map

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.690 
advantage here and like i said this map
is<00:05:38.930> very<00:05:39.200> prominent<00:05:39.590> she<00:05:39.710> is<00:05:39.770> at<00:05:39.919> times<00:05:40.100> a<00:05:40.370> true

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
is very prominent she is at times a true

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.830 
is very prominent she is at times a true
goon<00:05:40.820> coming<00:05:41.120> in<00:05:41.210> though<00:05:41.330> so<00:05:41.540> we'll<00:05:41.630> see<00:05:41.810> if

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
goon coming in though so we'll see if

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.440 
goon coming in though so we'll see if
he's<00:05:41.990> able<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.229> take<00:05:42.380> out<00:05:42.530> these<00:05:42.650> Marines<00:05:43.450> the

Marines will have the benefit of the
rigid<00:05:45.770> decides<00:05:46.160> to<00:05:46.340> be<00:05:46.490> used<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:46.940> yeah<00:05:47.120> he<00:05:47.270> is

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
rigid decides to be used and yeah he is

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.610 
rigid decides to be used and yeah he is
going<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.630> be<00:05:47.690> using<00:05:47.870> them<00:05:48.080> against<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.380> probe

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
going to be using them against the probe

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.950 
going to be using them against the probe
line<00:05:48.800> actually<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:50.180> reach<00:05:50.570> can't<00:05:50.870> do

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
line actually and reach can't do

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.150 
line actually and reach can't do
anything<00:05:51.110> about<00:05:51.229> these<00:05:51.410> Marines<00:05:51.710> directly<00:05:52.040> he

kill him and boxers three Marines now
and<00:06:00.530> he<00:06:01.520> can<00:06:01.640> really<00:06:01.760> just<00:06:02.000> do<00:06:02.570> some<00:06:02.690> serious

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
and he can really just do some serious

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.630 
and he can really just do some serious
whereas<00:06:03.229> men<00:06:03.380> against<00:06:03.560> his<00:06:03.680> pro<00:06:03.890> line<00:06:04.100> here<00:06:04.280> it

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
whereas men against his pro line here it

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.010 
whereas men against his pro line here it
looks<00:06:04.820> like<00:06:04.850> you<00:06:05.000> might<00:06:05.120> take<00:06:05.300> down<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:05.479> few

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
looks like you might take down a few

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.990 
looks like you might take down a few
probes<00:06:06.290> before<00:06:06.680> reach<00:06:07.250> can<00:06:07.460> come<00:06:07.610> back<00:06:07.760> there

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
probes before reach can come back there

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.090 
probes before reach can come back there
and<00:06:08.150> reach<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:09.290> gonna<00:06:09.500> come<00:06:09.710> up<00:06:09.830> there<00:06:09.860> with

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
and reach is gonna come up there with

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.469 
and reach is gonna come up there with
those<00:06:10.160> four<00:06:10.370> goons<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.910> think<00:06:11.210> finish

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
those four goons and I think finish

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.180 
those four goons and I think finish

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.280 
that one zealot
the<00:06:16.130> boxer<00:06:16.520> is<00:06:16.640> just<00:06:16.880> uh<00:06:16.970> my<00:06:17.810> crowing<00:06:18.080> pretty

well<00:06:18.470> here<00:06:18.740> he<00:06:19.190> did<00:06:19.340> loses<00:06:19.700> his<00:06:20.180> initial

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
well here he did loses his initial

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.730 
well here he did loses his initial
barracks<00:06:20.840> of<00:06:20.930> course<00:06:21.110> but<00:06:21.260> I<00:06:21.470> guess<00:06:21.710> he

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
barracks of course but I guess he

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.260 
barracks of course but I guess he
expected<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.400> because<00:06:22.520> he<00:06:22.790> did<00:06:22.940> build<00:06:23.150> an

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
expected that because he did build an

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.030 
expected that because he did build an
extra<00:06:23.480> barracks<00:06:23.750> in<00:06:23.870> his<00:06:23.960> face<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.440> he's

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
extra barracks in his face and he's

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.160
