00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.190
 inspiring me on several YouTube videos 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
 as the legend of zelda all his 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.790
 fallos created by eduardo blast rivera 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.519
 ramirez 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 I thought about creating this video that is foreign 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.379
 to all the productions that he has made 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 lately my ideal cell a way of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.439
 write about how a game would be for me 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.539
 from zelda totally perfect first my 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.250
 perfect cell could do with some 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 graphics like the final movie 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.980
 fantasy so realistic that sometimes not 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.079
 you think it's a videogame since what 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 important of a video game is not to be 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.710
 realize that you are playing a game of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 fiction to see so many graphics so 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.160
 believe that it is realistic to get everything is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.860
 real second 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.320
 Jairus is as large as the island 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.880
 of san andreas that the scenarios do not 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.400
 have to load each time we go to 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.160
 one place to another you know you are in the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.800
 market to the castle and there you have to 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.110
 load the best that lines you go 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.540
 directly to the castle and that the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.979
 forests and the deserts are totally 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.180
 Free and detailed nothing of gorges 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.580
 that makes you feel that you have the 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.110
 marked path that allows you a high 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.330
 exploration freedom as the first 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.210
 Zelda game and have missions 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.990
 secondary as the gta so that we can 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.649
 improve your third status as an animal 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 crossing pokÃ©mon gold and silver and older 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.450
 max the game that worked in time 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.660
 real and that the inhabitants of jairo 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.240
 they act depending on the time the day of 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.920
 the week and the month of the year this will make 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 the fiction of the video game lasts for 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 a lot of time already people love 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.390
 the fourth long video games the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.740
 dungeons should be very dark and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.000
 gloomy 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.610
 where we have to test 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.700
 our nerves and that monsters 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.280
 be totally intimidating that they are 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.049
 able to take away your sleep but that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 also show you that you must be 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.200
 brave for the sake of jair a fifth 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 feeling is the avatar of the player 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.250
 then let us choose how 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.769
 we want it to be to choose sex as in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.530
 instead of zelda and put on the clothes that 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.230
 we want after all the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.080
 protagonist is called link so that the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 player is connected to the game 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.670
 sixth the characters of jairo would have 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.610
 to talk like they are fixed characters 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.500
 they have the right to speak no pesos and if 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.410
 link is the avatar of the player because 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.989
 he is still mute and he speaks when 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.890
 speak the player himself and this would be my 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.890
 perfect cell
