I<00:04:28.170> am<00:04:29.170> guessing<00:04:29.590> these<00:04:30.100> are<00:04:30.340> world<00:04:30.550> war<00:04:30.760> ii

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
I am guessing these are world war ii

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.330 
I am guessing these are world war ii
world<00:04:31.540> war<00:04:31.660> one<00:04:32.020> our<00:04:32.200> world<00:04:32.440> war<00:04:32.650> two<00:04:32.950> because

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
world war one our world war two because

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.270 
world war one our world war two because
these<00:04:33.490> are<00:04:33.730> proper<00:04:34.150> soldiers<00:04:34.900> with<00:04:35.860> machine

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
these are proper soldiers with machine

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.880 
these are proper soldiers with machine
guns<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.850> things<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:41.050> i<00:04:41.110> think<00:04:41.200> that's<00:04:41.650> what

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
guns and things so i think that's what

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.570 
guns and things so i think that's what
we've<00:04:41.980> got<00:04:42.190> there<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:44.110> guy<00:04:44.410> he's<00:04:44.920> got<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.220> gun

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
we've got there this guy he's got a gun

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.940 
we've got there this guy he's got a gun
but<00:04:45.940> he's<00:04:46.090> been<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.690> over<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:47.500> meant<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.800> be

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
but he's been to over it's meant to be

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.470 
but he's been to over it's meant to be
on<00:04:48.040> his<00:04:48.160> shoulder<00:04:48.640> but<00:04:48.790> i<00:04:48.820> think<00:04:49.060> that's<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.330> bit

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
on his shoulder but i think that's a bit

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.100 
on his shoulder but i think that's a bit
older<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.650> looks<00:04:50.860> old<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.430> me<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.120> these<00:04:52.780> three
