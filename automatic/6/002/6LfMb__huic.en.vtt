00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.490 
into the two by two area that the tube
is<00:02:01.530> mimicking<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:03.020> they<00:02:04.020> follow<00:02:04.259> all

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
is mimicking right there they follow all

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
is mimicking right there they follow all
the<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.709> down<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the way down then they get it into the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
the way down then they get it into the
current<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.380> pushed<00:02:07.590> down<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> lava

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
current they get pushed down to the lava

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.910 
current they get pushed down to the lava
they<00:02:08.819> die<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.810> down<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:10.649> hole

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they die they go down that little hole

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.369 
they die they go down that little hole
right<00:02:10.950> there<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.519> they<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:13.019> we're<00:02:13.170> always

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
right there and they go to we're always

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.020 
right there and they go to we're always
sitting<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> other<00:02:14.069> hole<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.790> water

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
sitting in the other hole with the water

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.809 
sitting in the other hole with the water
like<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> collection<00:02:16.290> area<00:02:16.819> so

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
like the you know the collection area so

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.970 
like the you know the collection area so
it's<00:02:18.120> pretty<00:02:18.360> effective<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.799> best

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
it's pretty effective it's not the best

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.400 
it's pretty effective it's not the best
but<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.670> know<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.120> works<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:21.569> as<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.380> see

but you know it works and as you can see

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.720 
but you know it works and as you can see
outside<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.860> haven't<00:02:23.130> done<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.310> more<00:02:23.489> stone

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
outside I haven't done a more stone

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.970 
outside I haven't done a more stone

action going on it goes all the way down
into<00:02:36.030> my<00:02:36.239> branch<00:02:36.599> mining<00:02:36.870> system<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.849> would

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
into my branch mining system I would

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.910 
into my branch mining system I would
show<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.739> save

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.740 
show it to you but I'm going to save
that<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.489> later<00:02:41.700> day<00:02:41.940> maybe<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.629> guys

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that one for a later day maybe you guys

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.900 
that one for a later day maybe you guys
don't<00:02:42.810> know<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> branch<00:02:43.440> mining<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.190> my

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
don't know a branch mining is in my

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.089 
don't know a branch mining is in my
opinion<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.510> best<00:02:45.780> possible<00:02:46.019> way<00:02:46.319> to

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
opinion it's the best possible way to

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.120 
opinion it's the best possible way to
find<00:02:47.930> diamonds<00:02:48.930> which<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> why<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.950> so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
find diamonds which is why I have so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.129 
find diamonds which is why I have so
many<00:02:50.250> diamonds<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.810> there's<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.959> more<00:02:52.079> thing

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
many diamonds and there's one more thing

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.569 
many diamonds and there's one more thing
as<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.530> can<00:02:52.650> tell<00:02:52.859> there's<00:02:53.100> only<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.430> door

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
as you can tell there's only one door

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.759 
as you can tell there's only one door
there<00:02:53.819> because<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.510> iron<00:02:54.750> door<00:02:54.989> system<00:02:55.590> is

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
there because the iron door system is

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.390 
there because the iron door system is
it's<00:02:56.489> really<00:02:56.730> weird<00:02:56.880> but<00:02:58.040> nothing<00:02:59.040> too<00:02:59.220> much

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's really weird but nothing too much

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.979 
it's really weird but nothing too much
has<00:02:59.519> changed<00:02:59.549> here<00:02:59.970> I'm<00:03:00.090> another<00:03:00.420> chest<00:03:00.750> where

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
has changed here I'm another chest where

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.470 
has changed here I'm another chest where
my<00:03:01.139> wood<00:03:01.349> will<00:03:01.560> go<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.910> stuff<00:03:03.180> stores

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
my wood will go now that stuff stores

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.879 
my wood will go now that stuff stores
all<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.690> cobblestone<00:03:04.260> which<00:03:04.440> I'm<00:03:04.590> glad<00:03:04.859> I

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
all the cobblestone which I'm glad I

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.440 
all the cobblestone which I'm glad I
kept<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.489> now<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.790> make<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.090> all<00:03:06.239> into

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
kept because now I can make it all into

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.420 
kept because now I can make it all into
smooth<00:03:06.660> soon<00:03:08.299> pushing<00:03:09.299> area<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> same<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
smooth soon pushing area is the same the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.400 
smooth soon pushing area is the same the
wheat<00:03:11.639> farm<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.329> everything<00:03:12.690> area<00:03:12.989> how<00:03:13.230> much

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
wheat farm and everything area how much

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.009 
wheat farm and everything area how much
probably<00:03:13.769> till<00:03:14.340> those<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.359> same<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:15.810> when

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
probably till those is the same but when

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.780 
probably till those is the same but when
you<00:03:16.109> get<00:03:16.230> down<00:03:16.560> oh<00:03:17.540> my<00:03:18.540> god<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.590> nether<00:03:19.859> so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
you get down oh my god the nether so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.479 
you get down oh my god the nether so
yeah<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.940> made<00:03:21.150> another<00:03:21.359> portable<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:23.250> will

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
yeah I made another portable and we will

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.890 
yeah I made another portable and we will
going<00:03:23.609> there<00:03:23.910> eventually<00:03:24.919> not<00:03:25.919> now<00:03:26.069> though<00:03:26.250> so

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
going there eventually not now though so

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.050 
going there eventually not now though so
that's<00:03:27.900> probably<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:29.639> biggest<00:03:29.760> that's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that's probably the biggest that's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.289 
that's probably the biggest that's
actually<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.660> only<00:03:30.780> difference<00:03:31.230> down<00:03:31.410> here

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
actually the only difference down here

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.360 
actually the only difference down here
that's<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.540> same<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.959> said<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.590> yeah

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
that's all the same like I said and yeah

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's all the same like I said and yeah
that's<00:03:35.489> pretty<00:03:35.609> much<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.109> has<00:03:37.349> been

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
