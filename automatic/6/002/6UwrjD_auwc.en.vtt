Hi everyone!

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.880
Today I'm going to teach you how to make

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.380
Korean ginseng chicken soup

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's see what we need

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.420
Beside preparing a chicken

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.420
We also need some glutinous rice

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.583
Spring onion, ginger, garlic

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.120
Ginseng and red dates

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
Check the exact amount out on my blog

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.060
These ingredients in this white plate are

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.420
The special package for ginseng chicken soup

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.180
I bought from the Korean supermarket

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.980
There is this thin white ginseng in the package

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.260
And these things like wood chips and twigs

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.540
I think it should be some kind of herb

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.980
And two red dates

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.120
But I think it's not enough, so I add some more in

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.500
If you can't get this kind of package

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.560
Just prepare ginseng and red dates will be enough

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.800
Used the dried white ginseng or fresh ginseng

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.443
Or Korean ginseng

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.620
First, soak the glutinous rice in clear water for 1-2 hours

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.380
Peel the garlic

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.520
Slice the ginger

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540
And cut the spring onion into several pieces

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.200
After preparing all the side dishes

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140
Let's move on to the chicken

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.240
Remove all the extra parts between the tails and legs

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.820
Stuff the spring onion, ginger, garlic into the stomach

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.940
You can save some spring onion and ginger

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.280
For putting into the soup later

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.880
And then stuff the soaked glutinous rice in

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.016
Stuff a few red dates in as well

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.560
You can also save some red dates for the soup later

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.460
Korean likes to remove the stem when having ginseng

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.980
Because they think the stem will reduce

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.720
The medicinal value of the ginseng

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.680
After preparing all the ginseng

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
Pick several thin ones and stuff into the stomach

00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:01.653
Save some for the soup

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.700
After preparing the chicken, put it into the soup

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.080
And put the spring onion, ginger, and other herbs

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.380
We saved into the soup

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.720
Last, pour in the water and cover up all the ingredients

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.540
Boil this pot on the stove

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.500
Remove the impurities on the surface

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.280
And turn to the lowest heat

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.380
Stew it for about an hour

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.120
Because normally the ginseng chicken soup

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.920
Uses the tenderer chicken

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.129
So it doesn't need to be stewed for a long period of time

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.820
Season with some salt before you turn the heat off

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.340
Break the chicken stomach

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.440
Before you bring it on the table

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.580
You can see the glutinous rice in it is very soft already

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.960
Mix the glutinous rice and the soup when eating it

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.520
The chicken is still very tender

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.500
I hope you like this very refreshing recipe of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.420
Ginseng chicken soup

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.320
Thank you for watching
