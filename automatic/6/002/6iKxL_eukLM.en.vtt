00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.670
 the final of the 2012 club 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.429
 between barcelona 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.040
 the defending champion and anderlecht that is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.880
 the team that beat PSV in the half 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 final 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 after taking penalties who they 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.270
 then favorite for this final you are 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.980
 almost inclined to say barcelona 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 but both teams played earlier in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.350
 group stage of this tournament against each other 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 and then the game ended in a one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 so it would just be a nice open 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 contest can drill to a group 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.969
 barcelona here counterattack 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.190
 Anderlecht and then the men are there quickly 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.350
 out through the number 9 kabasele the shot 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.230
 alongside 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 and goalkeeper sergio gutiÃ©rrez need chenda 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.129
 so not to take action 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.129
 here again Anderlecht 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 many physically in the team fast 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 vanguard players and barcelona already had too 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.140
 awkward against them and I header 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 diarra on top of the lance train hard 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.910
 knocked 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 where he just doesn't get there under the bar 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.949
 and how many warnings 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.949
 barcelona still needed 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.630
 here come the catalans 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 agile winger via app call 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.780
 had a corner here than a minute 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 see if they are doing better than that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.439
 phase earlier in the competition then 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.710
 led a corner from barcelona 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.909
 a chance for other suffering 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.780
 short variant ahidar the header of whole 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.780
 and an own goal 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.829
 yes you don't expect that as a goalkeeper either 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.290
 you reach that stage there comes along a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 neat is actually right but yes 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.960
 own goal and therefore a 0 for 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 barcelona and they arrive so cheaply 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 a head start and maybe that they are with 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 that globe in their back pocket 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.800
 a bit easier to play football 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 catalans but that is not apparent from this 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.330
 ball and gets the chance to be wrong 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.710
 well hey the guard also something to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 long 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.150
 no longer comes to a debt and the ball 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.250
 in the hands of Goodyear's clear they 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.520
 a bad first half 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 david to rest 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 Anderlecht looking for the equalizer 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.350
 kabasele 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 the alberto try it sometime nice 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.730
 shot is just about the purpose of bootshare 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.670
 now reduced to barcelona 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.680
 ten after a red card 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.099
 that may offer perspective 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 Anderlecht shot the shot here 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.900
 from defender chancel mbemba 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.370
 but it seems Anderlecht not awarded 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.370
 to score during this final 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.209
 a corner kick then the pressure increases 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.829
 even the goalkeeper once forward 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.530
 it does not come to headlines such as bertrand 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.849
 whole truth and barsac cannot be otherwise 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.290
 then grow the ball 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.400
 Anderlecht looks another chance to get there 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.400
 never to pump that beam 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.430
 everyone could eat half of barcelona 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.439
 way the answer is no so the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.170
 referee whistle was last 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.480
 saw wind through otten cup 2012 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.579
 and so sadness looks like this 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.079
 afternoon and head in own goal 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.780
 then click a big chance on the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.630
 equalizer but it is barcelona that the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.949
 club 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.949
 [Applause]
