away<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.329> location<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:37.879> now<00:03:38.629> farther<00:03:39.049> up

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
away the location and now farther up

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.250 
away the location and now farther up
we're<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.680> go<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.129> we're<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.519> see

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
we're going to go and we're going to see

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.610

remains of a village town or something

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.250 
remains of a village town or something
higher<00:03:46.549> up<00:03:46.819> here<00:03:47.180> in<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.569> Sacred<00:03:47.870> Valley<00:03:47.900> of

higher up here in the Sacred Valley of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.290 
higher up here in the Sacred Valley of
Peru

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:13.090 

oh<00:04:11.200> boy<00:04:12.200> no<00:04:12.380> okay

oh boy no okay

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.240 
oh boy no okay
more<00:04:13.670> bones<00:04:13.970> here<00:04:15.820> along<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.970> path<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
more bones here along the path to the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.500 
more bones here along the path to the
ruins<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.460> think<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.910> ruins<00:04:23.240> are<00:04:23.360> right

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
ruins and I think the ruins are right

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.220 
ruins and I think the ruins are right
around<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.810> corner<00:04:23.900> looks<00:04:24.680> like<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:27.050> we

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
around the corner looks like so what we

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.500 
around the corner looks like so what we
found<00:04:27.440> right<00:04:27.740> here<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.730> is<00:04:28.910> an<00:04:29.090> intact

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
very distinct but we're not quite

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.909 
very distinct but we're not quite
finished<00:06:01.880> we're<00:06:02.210> gonna<00:06:02.300> keep<00:06:02.510> going<00:06:02.570> up<00:06:03.050> and
