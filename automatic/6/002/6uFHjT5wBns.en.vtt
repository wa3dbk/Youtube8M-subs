00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
uncomfortably I didn't feel like he lost

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.819 
uncomfortably I didn't feel like he lost
because<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:33.930> remember<00:00:34.230> boxing<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
because you know remember boxing is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.830 
because you know remember boxing is
round<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.160> round<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.910> felt<00:00:36.360> card<00:00:36.630> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
round by round and I think felt card on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
round by round and I think felt card on
the<00:00:36.989> rounds<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> punch<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.090> he<00:00:39.239> was

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the rounds but the punch is that he was

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
the rounds but the punch is that he was
getting<00:00:39.480> caught<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.930> by<00:00:40.559> Chris<00:00:40.829> Algieri<00:00:40.980> I'm

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
getting caught with by Chris Algieri I'm
just<00:00:41.790> thinking<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.770> heard<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.860> sound<00:00:44.040> level

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just thinking like I heard a sound level

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
just thinking like I heard a sound level
I<00:00:46.340> would<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.399> stick<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> myself<00:00:48.059> yet<00:00:48.270> look

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I would just stick to myself yet look

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.970 
I would just stick to myself yet look
Chris<00:00:49.920> Algieri<00:00:50.100> he<00:00:50.969> can't<00:00:51.239> punch<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.719> 147<00:00:52.230> yeah

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
Chris Algieri he can't punch on 147 yeah

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
Chris Algieri he can't punch on 147 yeah
he<00:00:53.160> wobbled<00:00:53.550> card<00:00:53.850> clean<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.690> round

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
he wobbled card clean in the first round

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
he wobbled card clean in the first round
and<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.230> were<00:00:55.289> several<00:00:55.469> times<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:56.100> car

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and there were several times where car

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
and there were several times where car
got<00:00:56.610> stoned<00:00:56.940> even<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.329> wobbled<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.870> he<00:00:58.469> got

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
got stoned even get wobbled but he got

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
got stoned even get wobbled but he got
stoned<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.190> bit<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.609> think<00:00:59.820> he<00:00:59.879> would

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
stoned a little bit and I think he would

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.280 
stoned a little bit and I think he would
get<00:01:00.149> caught<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:01.079> flush<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.739> Lord<00:01:02.640> shots

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
get caught really flush with Lord shots

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
get caught really flush with Lord shots
so<00:01:04.290> does<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.530> mean<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.100> means<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.119> found<00:01:06.450> me

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so does that mean that means I found me

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
so does that mean that means I found me
I<00:01:06.570> can't<00:01:06.869> fight<00:01:07.110> someone<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.340> sort<00:01:08.549> of

understand why I me was fine lad I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.369 
understand why I me was fine lad I
really<00:03:50.549> didn't<00:03:50.729> make<00:03:50.849> sense<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.150> me<00:03:51.379> because

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
really didn't make sense to me because

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.119 
really didn't make sense to me because
I'm<00:03:52.709> here<00:03:52.859> we've<00:03:53.069> seen<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:54.180> throws<00:03:54.540> these

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
I'm here we've seen he throws these

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.039 
I'm here we've seen he throws these
punches<00:03:56.129> which<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:56.879> see<00:03:57.030> coming<00:03:57.359> maybe

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
punches which you don't see coming maybe

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.479 
punches which you don't see coming maybe
because<00:03:58.409> he's<00:03:58.530> fallen<00:03:58.829> off<00:03:58.919> the<00:03:58.949> rocks<00:03:59.220> fire

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
because he's fallen off the rocks fire

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.379 
because he's fallen off the rocks fire
after<00:03:59.819> his<00:03:59.909> fall<00:04:00.209> south<00:04:01.019> post<00:04:01.290> was<00:04:01.470> all<00:04:01.620> along

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
after his fall south post was all along

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.420 
after his fall south post was all along
maybe<00:04:03.389> he<00:04:04.139> does<00:04:04.500> really<00:04:04.769> well<00:04:05.010> against<00:04:05.250> South

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
maybe he does really well against South

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.800 
maybe he does really well against South
paws<00:04:05.729> which<00:04:05.909> you've<00:04:06.060> seen<00:04:06.269> maybe<00:04:06.599> he<00:04:06.659> doesn't

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
paws which you've seen maybe he doesn't

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.960 
paws which you've seen maybe he doesn't
do<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:07.349> good<00:04:07.560> against<00:04:07.859> Orthodox<00:04:08.400> fighters<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
do as good against Orthodox fighters and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.699 
do as good against Orthodox fighters and
I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.750> that's<00:04:09.930> been<00:04:10.169> kind<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.620> made

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
I think that's been kind of made

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.780 
I think that's been kind of made
apparent<00:04:11.129> by<00:04:11.250> Chris<00:04:11.489> Algieri<00:04:11.669> today<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:13.790> think

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
apparent by Chris Algieri today I think

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.949 
apparent by Chris Algieri today I think
consciousness<00:04:15.269> took<00:04:15.419> some<00:04:15.659> more<00:04:15.810> power

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
consciousness took some more power

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.379 
consciousness took some more power
punches<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.680> thought<00:04:17.250> Conchita<00:04:17.849> from<00:04:18.090> my<00:04:18.239> body

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
punches I thought Conchita from my body

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.140 
punches I thought Conchita from my body
shots<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:19.019> think<00:04:19.829> me<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.099> con<00:04:20.400> should<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.940> been

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
shots I think me a con should have been

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.540 
shots I think me a con should have been
far<00:04:22.049> more<00:04:22.079> loaded<00:04:22.800> up<00:04:22.919> on<00:04:23.070> his<00:04:23.159> shots<00:04:23.400> he

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
far more loaded up on his shots he

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.550 
far more loaded up on his shots he
wasn't<00:04:24.029> throwing<00:04:24.389> his<00:04:24.570> punches<00:04:24.960> with<00:04:25.409> any

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
wasn't throwing his punches with any

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.550 
wasn't throwing his punches with any
authority<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.460> was<00:04:26.909> just<00:04:27.090> um

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
authority it was just um

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.370 
authority it was just um
cheese<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.040> moving<00:04:28.370> around<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:29.030> i<00:04:29.380> don't

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
cheese and moving around and i don't
