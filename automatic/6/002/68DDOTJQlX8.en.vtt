00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.889
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.320
 shown how to use your windows computer 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.210
 remote control from your android device 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.680
 I can show that here at one 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.850
 windows 7 computer in connection with 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.410
 a mobile phone 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.880
 Of course it works as well 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.190
 under every other android 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.410
 operating system for example on one 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.390
 tray is probably there again 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.380
 more comfortable but it works with the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 cellphone 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.690
 I use it now shares vlc from 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.789
 for the simple reason that the developers 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.469
 also directly a suitable app for 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.449
 android provide 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.309
 In that regard, we can assume that 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.300
 the whole thing together well 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.890
 is working 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.360
 Of course you will find link in the link 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.790
 description and there are also there 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 directly the link to the imo triple 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.769
 So here comes vnc point first 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.420
 download the link you will also find one 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.170
 description in each case the installer 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 version 32 or 64 bit and just here 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.330
 directly the link for remote ripple the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.280
 corresponding android version 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.170
 when you get out of the internet 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.420
 want to access her computer at home 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.680
 for example with yours with whom it 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.230
 then of course they have to be in theirs 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.350
 router still the appropriate ports 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.730
 unlock 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.530
 I'll come back later 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.930
 back though, for example 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 via a vpn server on it 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.320
 home network access 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.210
 For example, we have video for this 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.740
 the fritzbox already created then can 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.410
 Of course you save the step 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.120
 then just send the dough vnc 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.130
 through her vpn tunnel 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.230
 with vnc I have on the windows computer 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 already installed here or almost 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.920
 Basically just clicked through 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.720
 We will, however, during the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.270
 installation after two passwords 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.130
 asked for a remote access 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.620
 password that the password that we enter 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.120
 want to give or have to when we are on 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.190
 want to access the computer and that 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.660
 second is again an admin password 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.960
 in case of cases that wii remote 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.090
 so from the outside the configuration of vnc 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.100
 wanting to change something is far from over 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.260
 everyone must have a corresponding yes 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.179
 I have update password so I prove 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.700
 now here first the passwords for 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.140
 remote access with 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 the whole thing twice and that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.230
 breathing password I just take 5 4 3 2 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.690
 1 so 6 and 4 3 2 1 leaves back so 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.690
 In the end just here okay that's it then 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.190
 after that I have here in the systemtray 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.350
 namely a corresponding icon shares 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 vnc registered as a service here 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.120
 I also have the ip I access 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.290
 In any case, the ip in the lan and for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.430
 the case of the cases that you the whole 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.560
 time over the router from the outside 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.040
 then just have to configure the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.850
 port 5900 forward from your router 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.760
 on this computer with in this local 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.710
 ip then you can just from the outside over 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.480
 dynamic dns the videos we have 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.170
 already all created on it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.820
 access 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.010
 I push this time only to the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.620
 page and then we continue on the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.180
 mobile 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.830
 remo triple as I said I have here 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.090
 my mobile phone already installed 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.700
 I have the icon on the desktop 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.890
 So let's just start the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.170
 application is quite simply the whole new 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 connection since I assume that we 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.460
 at the beginning no connection in it 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.660
 I just call that a pet 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.460
 times ne house is the ip or dynamic 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.480
 dns name in my case it has to be now 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.940
 Be the ip 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:37.120
 so I'll make out 192 point 168 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:39.770
 point 1.197 the name is optional those 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.690
 I just collected 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.190
 should then I can save the whole thing 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.920
 in that case you will find this several times 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.140
 need or in the moment in which I 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.200
 several connections should have now 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.940
 enter password 123456 he should 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.990
 Remember, so far I put the da 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.880
 checkbox and at the end also okay clicked 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.260
 so what they have not seen on now 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.640
 I have the desktop directly to my 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.070
 background lost that will be more likely 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.140
 displayed black because that would otherwise be too 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.240
 data intensively the whole thing too 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.740
 So I see here now 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.450
 my desktop with the under android 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.980
 usual gestures I can do the whole thing 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.650
 of course now here to control 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.570
 Example just zoom in the two fingers 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.820
 and then pull it apart 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.900
 I see here also as a small 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.460
 since then , of course I can 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.870
 Now I'm using it too 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.060
 example on my start button clicks 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.130
 Of course, with some delay 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.410
 here on the mobile phone 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.110
 we make all the program accessories 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:46.730
 clicked on what are you doing there open 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:53.690
 Let's enter wordpad again 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.610
 So come out and collect a bit 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.410
 At the top of the bar, I have one beside me 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.990
 the thick button I have so synonymous 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.520
 a small keyboard and three buttons 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.290
 Three buttons represent the three mouse 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.910
 buttons I probably have 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.400
 Therefore we also see the mausrad 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.920
 is then next to just that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.990
 corresponding buttons and in the middle 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.150
 almost the keyboard if I'm there now 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.400
 then click on it, then I get to one 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.790
 directly my keyboard faded in and 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.530
 I also have a few upstairs 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.190
 so special functions so write times 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.190
 Hello World 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.960
 that this woman accepted 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.000
 not because that's just a keyboard for him 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.420
 Movement was straight so we take 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.420
 out again 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:52.699
 and have to 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:52.699
 so hello world is written by hand 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.750
 drive down the larger we drive 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.889
 Hall, let's see it all 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.690
 again on the desktop is on 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.490
 however, that can be relatively simple 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.979
 here also very short test with the 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.630
 right mouse button click once on it 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.139
 and here I get the appropriate 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.139
 context menu 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.670
 then to work with it is so 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.220
 just simple so 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.560
 vnc in conjunction with remo triple one 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.700
 easy possibility for your own 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.840
 remotely control the computer 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.790
 and at the moment where I am on the 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.790
 Mobile phone leaving the application 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.330
 I also turn here at the desktop 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.069
 They would not be good back, though 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.379
 because they do not remember her 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.370
 But they are actually computers 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.270
 remote control 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.270
 OK
