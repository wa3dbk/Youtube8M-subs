options but basically I didn't give him
to<00:03:07.650> him<00:03:07.890> he<00:03:08.160> still<00:03:08.370> gave<00:03:08.520> me<00:03:08.580> money<00:03:08.910> for

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
to him he still gave me money for

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.990 
to him he still gave me money for
attempting<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.860> get<00:03:11.010> him<00:03:11.160> back<00:03:11.340> for<00:03:11.580> him
