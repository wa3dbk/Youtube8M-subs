00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
Shalom I am bass quit and guess what is

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.700 
Shalom I am bass quit and guess what is
this<00:00:04.700> it<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.940> four<00:00:06.240> by<00:00:06.450> four<00:00:06.480> by<00:00:06.870> six<00:00:07.200> cuboid

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
this it is a four by four by six cuboid

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.190 
this it is a four by four by six cuboid
a<00:00:07.950> form<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.670> twisty<00:00:09.120> puzzle<00:00:09.510> like<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a form of a twisty puzzle like the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.490 
a form of a twisty puzzle like the
rubik's<00:00:10.590> cube<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.340> few<00:00:12.150> weeks<00:00:12.389> back<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:13.049> saw<00:00:13.290> one

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
rubik's cube a few weeks back I saw one

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.129 
rubik's cube a few weeks back I saw one
for<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.980> first<00:00:14.250> time<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.880> life<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.690> Chris

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
for the first time in my life on Chris

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
for the first time in my life on Chris
but<00:00:16.410> Huber's<00:00:16.890> YouTube<00:00:17.369> channel<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> it

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
but Huber's YouTube channel and it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.990 
but Huber's YouTube channel and it
fascinated<00:00:18.630> me<00:00:19.160> seeing<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
fascinated me seeing as how it is a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.950 
fascinated me seeing as how it is a
shape-shifting<00:00:21.810> puzzle<00:00:22.880> soon<00:00:23.880> thereafter<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
shape-shifting puzzle soon thereafter I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.670 
shape-shifting puzzle soon thereafter I
bought<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:25.830> HK<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.609> store<00:00:27.080> right<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
bought one from HK now store right now I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
bought one from HK now store right now I
cannot<00:00:29.010> yet<00:00:29.220> solve<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.900> too

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
cannot yet solve it it is a bit too

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
cannot yet solve it it is a bit too
complicated<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.800> me<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> plan<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
complicated for me but I plan to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
complicated for me but I plan to
eventually<00:00:33.899> master<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.520> table<00:00:35.910> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
eventually master it on the table you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
eventually master it on the table you
can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> few<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:37.050> cubes<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> also

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
