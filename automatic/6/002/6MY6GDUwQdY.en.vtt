00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.810
 very nice people and welcome to this 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.329
 video where I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.759
 change online then clarify that when 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:11.620
 I say change the online mode and endorsed 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.660
 all general modes and not only 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.059
 to which they will see on screen this 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.590
 tutorial scale relative to many what 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.120
 follow me of duero besides tutorials of 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.380
 I 'm also going to leave you much 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.200
 description 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.200
 the other online tutorial topics that 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.230
 I have the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.740
 basically to evolve and good 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.200
 talk to the marlon so that he serves 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.210
 unlock the combos that would be the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.210
 first step so let's start 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.350
 as I told them first thing to do 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.700
 evolve to give who you speak but so 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.440
 that we're going to have to find both 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.620
 items that I just found on the screen 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.140
 and then go to Libya and good to do long 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 matter what I'm seeing 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.440
 players on screen and I do it quickie 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.240
 because already in the previous one in conjugate 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 mola in part 2 explain everything detailed 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 for the description after doing this 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.450
 evolution will have to move in the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.450
 character changes 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 talking to the sea ​​does the question of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 knock it down and carry it has to buy it 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 there are who are watching on screen 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.000
 I also showed it to me with four 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 parties and evil can not be in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 minority 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.330
 abdel to florence measures bias praying 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.570
 accidentally I found him a ferris wheel and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 how she is for you 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.900
 quickie to see if we can already good as 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.390
 come down there I get in red combo that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.920
 you're ready to make the changes what 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 what are you going to see next is a 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.140
 fragment of my video how to play online 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.790
 part 3 viking the mouse over the power 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.620
 the general keeps a tight general 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.530
 and touching one in power is changed when 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.990
 one puts on his power one puts on his 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.620
 put well so they are selected then 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:28.480
 alt 2 that we will be able to see 12 12 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.890
 now 3 to general 3 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 by keeping 4 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.520
 520 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.980
 Now let's take a quick look at the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.620
 keyboard first of all surely already 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.220
 they know they should change quickly 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.260
 the buttons 1 2 3 is not the keyboard 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.550
 numerical trick but that is also the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.670
 screen since as I said before that 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.890
 were to accommodate the powers in those 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.110
 buttons specifically always 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.780
 remember to hit is yes or yes in 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.630
 control if they do not use it they do not stick to 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.730
 no one except in the situations that most 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.550
 of the broad explain how they see in that w 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.660
 also reading is a bit inconvenient for 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.660
 something starts come and I told them to be able 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.090
 should locate in the one two three four 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.890
 and in the circus that's my recommendation 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.340
 customized to meet 123 and 124 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.230
 Quickly to see to bounce are the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.050
 life positions all that with the key 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.540
 who are watching on the screen basically 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.770
 we should do something like 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.620
 who are watching on screen 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.500
 My recommendation is that you practice this 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.480
 in a zone of not drinking where you 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.050
 hit your opponent without making him 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.440
 damage has a reflection and then this 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.050
 would make it much easier to change obviously in 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.140
 a fight with your cool and with others 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.060
 things would be much harder without 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.990
 say they're going to have to post to 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.900
 speed lowers the largest prey they can 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.900
 let's see it in slow motion as you see 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.530
 happened to click on some some bugs 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.270
 honest let right click clicked and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.220
 I start to change how you see now 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.350
 keyboard 12 4 124 that's because of the selection 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.320
 the powers that I have but also 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:38.420
 I can do exactly the same with 1 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.129
 2 and 3 as you see 1 2 4 and see how it ends 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.529
 per second after 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.289
 in a number things are facilitated 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.719
 enough since they do not need to have the 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.699
 control button to be able to hit your 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:52.060
 opponent and remember only your 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.540
 opponent 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 but they should turn a lot 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.610
 fast try 9 triple keyboard 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.730
 open as you see I'm trying to 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.290
 change I touch the screen control 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.210
 but because I want to get used to 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.950
 always touching it makes me easier 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.490
 touching the control even if it is not 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.099
 necessary 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.280
 well the best currently changing 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.780
 because long ago formed not only me meto 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.289
 to make these good tutorials 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.520
 remember something one and another thing equally 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.889
 the character who also owes 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.220
 screen is pretty weak security is 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.220
 they gave an account 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.270
 do not 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.280
 let's see it again in slow motion 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.620
 as they see clicking on the enemy and 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.599
 a tight you and right and use 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.599
 world 1 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 24 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.220
 24 and like in the fuel when he touched 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.289
 again it takes a bit as you see 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.860
 it also depends a lot on the time in 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.020
 the one who plays the numbers as you see now 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.980
 have a too fast and does not 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.740
 I was eating 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.830
 but once I want to make it slow 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.300
 it comes out as they just saw it 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.060
 ah 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.430
 the thing changes a bit more when it was a 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.440
 character that has pe that basically 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.740
 would be what you should also on screen 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.960
 the red wings that are produced when killing 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.360
 repeatedly to users once 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.539
 that they have small can change 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.810
 map until they are cut is a connect 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:35.300
 or they have the clear small bar command 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.610
 As you can see, I'm hitting him without touching the 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.539
 control so be very careful if 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.220
 they see someone with what then they do not try 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.169
 of not attacking to be caquetá the because 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.449
 they could attack him even if they do not touch the 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.729
 control button 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.860
 up to here the tutorial people any 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:54.529
 criticism is accepted they leave it at 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.689

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.669
 like favorite thank you very much 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.520

 custom to add in the networks

 my channel people I do not know
