00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
so I wanted to come up with a better

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.280 
so I wanted to come up with a better
tripod<00:00:05.430> type<00:00:05.640> system<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.270> my<00:00:06.420> cell<00:00:07.109> phone

tripod type system for my cell phone
which<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:09.050> saw<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.410> video<00:00:10.679> from<00:00:11.070> another<00:00:11.940> channel

meet trapper either version that's using

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.710 
meet trapper either version that's using
this<00:00:16.440> 2<00:00:16.590> PVC<00:00:17.150> pull<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:20.359> anyway<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this 2 PVC pull and anyway I like the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.910 
this 2 PVC pull and anyway I like the
idea<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> little

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
idea that I just I'm gonna do a little

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
idea that I just I'm gonna do a little
different<00:00:23.189> version<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.960> my

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
different version of it and what my

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.330 
different version of it and what my
thought<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
thought is on this one is that it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
thought is on this one is that it's
going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.570> lightweight<00:00:27.800> packable

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
going to be very lightweight packable

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.959 
going to be very lightweight packable
and<00:00:29.160> easy<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> set<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.859> as<00:00:31.859> far<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
and easy to set up so as far as all the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.740 
and easy to set up so as far as all the
stuff<00:00:33.149> they're<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> need<00:00:33.600> just

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
stuff they're going to need just

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.459 
stuff they're going to need just
something<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> measure<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.559> piece<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> PVC<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
something to measure with piece of PVC a

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.430 
something to measure with piece of PVC a
couple<00:00:37.469> joints<00:00:39.559> I'm<00:00:40.559> using<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:40.980> dremel<00:00:41.309> tool

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
couple joints I'm using my dremel tool

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.680 
couple joints I'm using my dremel tool
so<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.680> may<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.579> further<00:00:44.700> along

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.549

very first stuff I did is I just took

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
very first stuff I did is I just took
the<00:00:50.489> button<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.120> phone<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.820> be

the button in my phone and I just are be
outfitted<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.140> gonna<00:00:55.260> cut<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> out

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430 

all<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.080> way<00:01:23.170> around<00:01:23.440> there<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:25.440> he's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
all the way around there and then he's

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.180 
all the way around there and then he's
different<00:01:26.740> tip<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.040> make<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.670> nice<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:27.790> smooth

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
different tip to make it nice and smooth

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190 
different tip to make it nice and smooth
okay<00:01:30.190> it's<00:01:30.550> got<00:01:30.670> three<00:01:31.570> rough<00:01:31.750> lines<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.110> it

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
okay it's got three rough lines in it

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.020 
okay it's got three rough lines in it
out<00:01:32.290> there<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:33.159> then<00:01:33.310> I'm<00:01:33.400> gonna<00:01:33.550> switch<00:01:33.759> over

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
out there and then I'm gonna switch over

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.660 
out there and then I'm gonna switch over
to<00:01:34.060> different<00:01:34.540> bit<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.990> more<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.670> grinding

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
to different bit it's more of a grinding

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
to different bit it's more of a grinding
bit<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:37.450> finished<00:01:37.720> up<00:01:37.780> all<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.020> corners<00:01:38.380> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
bit you finished up all the corners and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.200 
bit you finished up all the corners and
then<00:01:39.220> when<00:01:39.399> I'm<00:01:39.490> done<00:01:39.520> I'm<00:01:39.850> gonna<00:01:39.940> drill<00:01:40.180> a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
then when I'm done I'm gonna drill a

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.899 
then when I'm done I'm gonna drill a
hole<00:01:40.450> through<00:01:40.720> both<00:01:41.560> ends<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.550> I<00:01:42.610> know<00:01:42.670> where

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
hole through both ends so I know where

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.719 
hole through both ends so I know where
to<00:01:43.090> go<00:01:43.210> through<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.570> other<00:01:43.690> side<00:01:44.580> see<00:01:45.580> what

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
to go through on the other side see what

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.460 
to go through on the other side see what
looks<00:01:45.909> like<00:01:45.940> once<00:01:46.149> all<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.420> cleaned<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:49.470> yes

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
looks like once all that cleaned up yes

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.400 
looks like once all that cleaned up yes
we're<00:01:50.649> gonna<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:52.360> off<00:01:52.539> some<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:55.410> we

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
we're gonna take off some of this we

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.040 
we're gonna take off some of this we
couldn't<00:01:56.679> get<00:01:56.800> real<00:01:57.570> smooth<00:01:58.570> with<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:58.960> the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
couldn't get real smooth with just the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:08.730 
couldn't get real smooth with just the
cutter

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.590 

okay<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:10.010> is<00:02:10.100> kind<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.400> idea

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
okay so this is kind of the idea

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.080 
okay so this is kind of the idea
not<00:02:12.020> all<00:02:12.170> rounded<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.760> actually<00:02:14.060> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
not all rounded out this is actually a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.360 
not all rounded out this is actually a
calculator<00:02:14.900> since<00:02:15.080> I'm<00:02:15.230> using<00:02:15.740> my<00:02:15.920> phone<00:02:16.160> but

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
calculator since I'm using my phone but

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
calculator since I'm using my phone but
my<00:02:17.300> phone<00:02:17.810> actually<00:02:17.900> fits<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.290> there<00:02:18.410> little

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
my phone actually fits in there little

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.470 
my phone actually fits in there little
snugger<00:02:18.980> than<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:20.360> gonna

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
snugger than that and then I'm gonna

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.820 
snugger than that and then I'm gonna
show<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:21.050> I'm<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.200> do<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> make<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
show you what I'm gonna do to make it a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.080 
show you what I'm gonna do to make it a
little<00:02:21.980> bit<00:02:22.130> more<00:02:22.250> portable<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.700> easy<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.060> use

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
little bit more portable and easy to use

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.430 
little bit more portable and easy to use
okay<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.150> I've<00:02:26.300> gone<00:02:26.390> through<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.780> made<00:02:26.870> two

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
okay so I've gone through and made two

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440 
okay so I've gone through and made two
marks<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.770> here<00:02:27.890> which<00:02:27.980> I'm<00:02:28.100> gonna<00:02:28.220> cut<00:02:28.450> and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
marks on here which I'm gonna cut and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.620 
marks on here which I'm gonna cut and
those<00:02:29.660> are<00:02:30.220> about<00:02:31.220> 19<00:02:31.760> inches<00:02:31.850> which<00:02:32.150> will<00:02:32.480> fit

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
those are about 19 inches which will fit

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.150 
those are about 19 inches which will fit
my<00:02:32.780> backpack<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.350> why<00:02:33.440> I've<00:02:33.650> picked<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
my backpack is why I've picked that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.910 
my backpack is why I've picked that
number<00:02:34.990> but<00:02:35.990> anyway<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.500> thought<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.770> these

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
number but anyway the thought is these

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.640 
number but anyway the thought is these
can<00:02:37.040> go<00:02:37.190> into<00:02:37.970> my<00:02:38.090> pack<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.600> then<00:02:39.020> be<00:02:39.200> put<00:02:39.380> snap

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
can go into my pack and then be put snap

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.160

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
something that doesn't require it being

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.840 
something that doesn't require it being
stuck<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.430> ground

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
stuck in the ground

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.000 
stuck in the ground
so<00:03:32.020> I'll<00:03:33.020> set<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.860> looks

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
so I'll set this all up in so it looks

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.410 
so I'll set this all up in so it looks
like<00:03:36.640> it'll<00:03:37.640> look<00:03:37.850> like<00:03:38.000> I'll<00:03:38.150> put<00:03:38.330> together

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
like it'll look like I'll put together

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.620 
like it'll look like I'll put together
this<00:03:39.410> basically<00:03:39.830> it's<00:03:40.130> three<00:03:40.459> segments<00:03:40.970> and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
this basically it's three segments and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.000 
this basically it's three segments and
move<00:03:41.780> over<00:03:41.930> here<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> winds<00:03:42.560> killing<00:03:42.830> me<00:03:42.890> but

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
move over here the winds killing me but

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.890 
move over here the winds killing me but
that's<00:03:43.940> what<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.150> looks<00:03:44.270> like<00:03:44.360> on<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.600> block<00:03:44.780> I

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900
