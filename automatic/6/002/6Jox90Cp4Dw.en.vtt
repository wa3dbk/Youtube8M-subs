00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.080 

okay<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.650> last<00:00:01.829> model<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.370> wanted<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:03.030> you

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay the last model I wanted to show you

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay the last model I wanted to show you
is<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.570> building<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.740> we'll<00:00:05.609> build<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.940> Eiffel

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
is a building so we'll build the Eiffel

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.070 
is a building so we'll build the Eiffel
Tower<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.700> we'll<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> very<00:00:09.450> simple<00:00:09.809> version

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
Tower and we'll do a very simple version

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
Tower and we'll do a very simple version
of<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:11.360> scale<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:16.039> shower<00:00:17.039> wireframe<00:00:17.699> on

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
of it scale this up shower wireframe on

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.689 
of it scale this up shower wireframe on
shaded<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:22.130> we're<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.250> build<00:00:23.519> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shaded and we're gonna build this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.929 
shaded and we're gonna build this
version<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> Eiffel<00:00:24.810> Tower<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.939> different

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
version of the Eiffel Tower in different

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.320 
version of the Eiffel Tower in different
pieces<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:28.369> we'll<00:00:29.369> build<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.060> part

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
pieces so we'll build this first part

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.990 
pieces so we'll build this first part
here<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.199> I'm<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.830> use<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.820> same

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
here like so I'm gonna use all the same

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
here like so I'm gonna use all the same
methods<00:00:33.450> previously<00:00:34.320> used<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.140> will<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
methods previously used so will this

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.600 
methods previously used so will this
will<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:40.250> base<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.620> bottom<00:00:43.950> section<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
will be the base of the bottom section I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
will be the base of the bottom section I
want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> teach<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> new<00:00:46.230> way<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
want to teach you about a new way to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619 
want to teach you about a new way to
snap<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.399> called<00:00:47.670> vert<00:00:48.000> snapping<00:00:48.510> if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
snap and that's called vert snapping if

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.709 
snap and that's called vert snapping if
I<00:00:48.750> hope<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> V<00:00:49.350> key<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.030> move<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> over<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.510> one

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I hope the V key I move this over to one

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
I hope the V key I move this over to one
of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> vertices<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.800> gonna<00:00:52.949> snap<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.149> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of the vertices it's gonna snap to this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
of the vertices it's gonna snap to this
other<00:00:54.510> model<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.449> snappy<00:00:57.449> Wirt

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
other model just like a snappy Wirt

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.979 
other model just like a snappy Wirt
holding<00:00:58.649> V<00:00:58.980> excuse<00:00:59.670> using<00:01:00.059> me<00:01:00.120> holding<00:01:00.420> X<00:01:00.660> or

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
holding V excuse using me holding X or

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.320 
holding V excuse using me holding X or
holding<00:01:01.289> Jay<00:01:02.989> I'll<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.170> insert<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.830> edge

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
holding Jay I'll just insert an edge

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.890 
holding Jay I'll just insert an edge
just<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just like so and this is just going to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.280 
just like so and this is just going to
be<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.409> simple<00:01:10.740> version<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:12.020> face<00:01:13.020> mode

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
be a very simple version of it face mode

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
be a very simple version of it face mode
again<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> extrude<00:01:18.500> make<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
again and I will extrude make a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.510 
again and I will extrude make a
selection<00:01:20.540> extrude<00:01:22.280> scale<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:25.520> extrude

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
selection extrude scale and extrude

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.200 
selection extrude scale and extrude
again

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:47.620 

shoot<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> few<00:01:34.570> more<00:01:34.750> times<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.320> for<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.710> top

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.460 

and<00:01:48.140> hit<00:01:48.290> artists<00:01:48.710> kale<00:01:49.780> insert<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.869> few<00:01:51.170> edge

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
and hit artists kale insert a few edge

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.780 
and hit artists kale insert a few edge
loops<00:01:55.180> throw<00:01:56.180> my<00:01:56.390> selection<00:02:00.520> here<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.610> have<00:02:01.759> a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
loops throw my selection here we have a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.760 
loops throw my selection here we have a
simple<00:02:02.180> version<00:02:02.689> of<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.930> tower<00:02:08.440> now<00:02:09.440> for<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
simple version of the tower now for the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.590 
simple version of the tower now for the
legs

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
legs

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.120 
legs
we'll<00:02:11.600> build<00:02:11.900> these<00:02:12.050> all<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.620> separately

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
we'll build these all out separately

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.190 
we'll build these all out separately
well<00:02:13.670> first<00:02:13.940> let<00:02:14.120> me<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:17.540> fix<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.840> up<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
well first let me just fix this up a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.580 
well first let me just fix this up a
little<00:02:18.319> bit<00:02:18.530> more<00:02:22.690> okay<00:02:23.690> now<00:02:23.989> for<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.319> legs

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
little bit more okay now for the legs

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
little bit more okay now for the legs
what<00:02:24.860> I'm<00:02:24.950> gonna<00:02:25.069> do

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
so I'm just gonna create a cube like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I'm just gonna create a cube like
just<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.330> I'm<00:02:36.200> gonna<00:02:36.500> go<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.800> face

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
just like this and I'm gonna go to face

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.390 
just like this and I'm gonna go to face
mode<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.799> my<00:02:39.920> components<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.720> extrude

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.309 

and<00:02:46.400> extrude<00:02:47.239> one<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.630> time<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.989> I'm<00:02:50.989> going

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and extrude one more time and I'm going

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.479 
and extrude one more time and I'm going
to<00:02:51.470> hold<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.890> V<00:02:52.220> key<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.140> snap<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:55.459> that

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
to hold the V key and snap to that

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.440 
to hold the V key and snap to that
vertice<00:02:56.450> right<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.010> then<00:02:58.880> continue<00:02:59.390> to

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
vertice right there and then continue to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.020 
vertice right there and then continue to
scale<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:01.160> manipulate<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:04.250> item<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.820> want

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
scale and manipulate this item so I want

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.569 
scale and manipulate this item so I want
to<00:03:05.060> show<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.359> way<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> move<00:03:06.430> what<00:03:07.430> do<00:03:07.519> you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.290 
duplicate it rotate it this time 270
degrees<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:43.370> is<00:04:43.699> a<00:04:44.030> basic<00:04:44.690> simple

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
degrees and there is a basic simple

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.260 
degrees and there is a basic simple
version<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.990> Eiffel<00:04:48.410> Tower<00:04:49.030> now<00:04:50.030> what<00:04:50.180> I'm

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
version of the Eiffel Tower now what I'm

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.020 
version of the Eiffel Tower now what I'm
going<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.600> do<00:04:50.780> now<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.259> just<00:04:51.290> scale<00:04:52.160> these<00:04:52.490> just

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
going to do now is just scale these just

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.439 
going to do now is just scale these just
a<00:04:53.210> little<00:04:53.449> bit<00:04:54.820> one<00:04:55.820> little<00:04:56.030> trick<00:04:56.240> when

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
a little bit one little trick when

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.060 
a little bit one little trick when
you're<00:04:56.600> scaling<00:04:56.900> something<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.919> get

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
you're scaling something and you get

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.640 
you're scaling something and you get
this<00:04:58.280> sort<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.699> look<00:04:58.880> it's<00:04:59.360> because<00:04:59.810> they<00:05:00.500> have

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
this sort of look it's because they have

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710 
this sort of look it's because they have
different<00:05:00.949> translations<00:05:01.790> now<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.509> what<00:05:02.630> I'm

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
different translations now so what I'm

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.930 
different translations now so what I'm
going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.050> here<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:04.340> I'm<00:05:04.580> going<00:05:04.699> to<00:05:04.790> hit

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
going to do here is I'm going to hit

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.770 
going to do here is I'm going to hit
command<00:05:05.150> G<00:05:05.900> or<00:05:06.169> control<00:05:06.560> G<00:05:06.740> on<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.949> BC<00:05:07.340> and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
command G or control G on the BC and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.689 
command G or control G on the BC and
group<00:05:08.780> these<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.350> shrink<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.889> just<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.550> little

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
group these and shrink it just a little

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.689 
group these and shrink it just a little
bit<00:05:11.320> looks<00:05:12.320> like<00:05:12.560> for<00:05:12.860> both<00:05:13.009> of<00:05:13.160> these<00:05:13.220> in<00:05:13.400> Abdo

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
bit looks like for both of these in Abdo

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.430 
bit looks like for both of these in Abdo
