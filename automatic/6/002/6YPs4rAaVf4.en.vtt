00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
before Marciano had died that that this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110 
before Marciano had died that that this
thing<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.260> called<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> super<00:00:58.980> fight<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
thing was called a super fight and it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
thing was called a super fight and it
was<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> computerized<00:01:01.590> version<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
was kind of a computerized version of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.939 
was kind of a computerized version of
Muhammad<00:01:02.609> Ali<00:01:02.820> versus<00:01:03.270> Rocky<00:01:04.199> Marciano

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
Muhammad Ali versus Rocky Marciano

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250 
Muhammad Ali versus Rocky Marciano
and<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> lot<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> people<00:01:06.390> wonder<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.110> who

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and a lot of people wonder you know who

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
and a lot of people wonder you know who
went<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.710> those<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.700> guess<00:01:08.939> just

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
went out those two and I guess just

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.640 
went out those two and I guess just
because<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> different<00:01:10.380> eras

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
because you know the different eras

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
because you know the different eras
involved<00:01:11.130> um<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.210> couldn't<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.630> do

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
involved um you couldn't really do

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.050 
involved um you couldn't really do
something<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.460> Rocky

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
something like that for you know Rocky

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
something like that for you know Rocky
Marciano<00:01:15.920> Joe<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.130> say<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.520> already

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
Marciano Joe will say they already

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
Marciano Joe will say they already
fought<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.220> interesting<00:01:20.490> take

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
fought and it was an interesting take

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
fought and it was an interesting take
you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.659> computer<00:01:22.590> technology<00:01:23.130> was

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you know because computer technology was

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
you know because computer technology was
giving<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.630> getting<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:24.960> better

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
giving where he was getting much better

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640

and stuff and you know this was you know
I<00:01:28.860> guess<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:29.970> good<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I guess this was a kind of good way to

and<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.579> money<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.000> his<00:01:54.090> family

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
and make some money for his family

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.970 
and make some money for his family
I<00:01:55.210> guess<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:55.990> was<00:01:56.170> another<00:01:56.410> way<00:01:56.590> for<00:01:56.830> him<00:01:56.950> to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
I guess this was another way for him to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.620 
I guess this was another way for him to
make<00:01:57.040> money<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.640> he<00:01:57.730> had<00:01:57.820> been<00:01:57.970> out<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.120> sport

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
for at least a year or two by this time

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
kind of slow so um you know not as slow

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720 
kind of slow so um you know not as slow
as<00:03:01.209> portrayed<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.959> film<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:02.500> slow<00:03:02.800> Hill

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
as portrayed in that film but slow Hill

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.430 
as portrayed in that film but slow Hill
compared<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.239> these<00:03:04.420> standing<00:03:04.989> over

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
compared to all these standing over

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.860 
compared to all these standing over
there<00:03:05.590> because<00:03:05.800> all<00:03:06.550> he<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> very<00:03:07.209> fast<00:03:07.600> but

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
there because all he was a very fast but

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.009 
there because all he was a very fast but
I<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.110> very<00:03:08.140> fast<00:03:08.680> hands<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:10.150> I'm<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.810> fight

like<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.560> just<00:03:11.590> think<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.100> Ollie<00:03:12.459> we

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
like this I just think that Ollie we

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.660 
like this I just think that Ollie we
kind<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.540> exploit<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.320> think<00:03:14.680> early

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
kind of just exploit that I think early

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.630 
kind of just exploit that I think early

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.980 
after he throws his left jab you know
he'll<00:03:47.790> sneak<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.270> short<00:03:48.480> right<00:03:48.720> hand

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
he'll sneak in that short right hand

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.040 
he'll sneak in that short right hand
they<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.350> throw<00:03:49.850> stuff<00:03:50.850> like<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.450> I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
they like throw stuff like that and I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.690 
they like throw stuff like that and I
think<00:03:52.590> Marciano<00:03:53.250> will<00:03:53.340> have<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.490> lot<00:03:53.670> of

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
think Marciano will have a lot of

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.940 
think Marciano will have a lot of
trouble<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:55.200> see<00:03:55.410> Marciano

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
trouble with that I do see Marciano

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.610 
trouble with that I do see Marciano
going<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.550> body<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:58.050> kind<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.440> see

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
going to the body and I do kind of see

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.040 
going to the body and I do kind of see
Marciano<00:03:59.459> possibly<00:03:59.910> knocking<00:04:00.270> down<00:04:00.450> Muhammad

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
Marciano possibly knocking down Muhammad

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.550 
Marciano possibly knocking down Muhammad
Ali<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:02.370> fight<00:04:02.580> similar<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.560> Wepner

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
Ali in the fight similar to the Wepner

our lethality getting up but all he had
a<00:04:12.209> really<00:04:12.540> good<00:04:12.810> chin<00:04:13.310> but<00:04:14.310> I'm<00:04:14.489> at<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> same

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
a really good chin but I'm at the same

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.500 
a really good chin but I'm at the same
time<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:16.130> Marciano<00:04:17.150> did<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.329> trouble

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
time you know Marciano did have trouble

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.870 
time you know Marciano did have trouble
against<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.019> Archie<00:04:19.380> Moore<00:04:19.680> Jersey<00:04:20.609> Joe

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
against the Archie Moore Jersey Joe

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.510 
against the Archie Moore Jersey Joe
Walcott<00:04:20.910> those<00:04:21.630> were<00:04:21.750> fights<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.290> he<00:04:23.280> was

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
Walcott those were fights that he was

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.210 
Walcott those were fights that he was
losing<00:04:23.880> wasn't<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> cards<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.860> he<00:04:26.010> did

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
losing wasn't on the cards and he did

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.150 
losing wasn't on the cards and he did
come<00:04:26.250> back<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.910> I'm<00:04:27.840> one<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:28.440> those<00:04:28.560> fights<00:04:28.860> by

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
come back and I'm one of those fights by

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
come back and I'm one of those fights by
but<00:04:29.850> via<00:04:30.030> knockout<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.780> know<00:04:30.930> against

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
but via knockout you know against

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.320 
but via knockout you know against
Walcott<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> think<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.760> second<00:04:33.150> fight

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
Walcott I think in the second fight

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.290 
Walcott I think in the second fight
lands<00:04:34.290> this<00:04:34.560> crucial<00:04:35.190> right<00:04:35.610> hand<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.120> just

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
lands this crucial right hand that just

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.850 
lands this crucial right hand that just
hadn't<00:04:36.660> followed<00:04:37.110> down<00:04:37.350> right<00:04:37.620> into<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
hadn't followed down right into the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.010 
hadn't followed down right into the
ropes<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.830> know<00:04:40.919> it<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.810> portrayed<00:04:42.810> by

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
ropes and you know it is portrayed by

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.780 
ropes and you know it is portrayed by
some<00:04:43.229> people's<00:04:43.560> one<00:04:43.770> probably<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.550> greatest

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
some people's one probably the greatest

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.150 
some people's one probably the greatest
knockout<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> long<00:04:45.570> time<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.710> think<00:04:46.770> with<00:04:47.040> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
knockout a long time so I think with the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.450 
knockout a long time so I think with the
sheer<00:04:47.490> strength<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.620> Rocky<00:04:49.620> Marciano<00:04:49.890> who

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
sheer strength of Rocky Marciano who

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.830 
sheer strength of Rocky Marciano who
think<00:04:50.700> you're<00:04:50.940> possibly<00:04:51.330> knocked<00:04:51.570> down

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
think you're possibly knocked down

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.450 
think you're possibly knocked down
Muhammad<00:04:52.380> Ali<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:52.740> not<00:04:52.890> knock<00:04:53.160> them<00:04:53.310> out

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
Muhammad Ali but not knock them out

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.940 
Muhammad Ali but not knock them out
especially<00:04:54.300> if<00:04:54.810> Joe<00:04:55.020> Frazier<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.590> George

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
especially if Joe Frazier and George

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.370 
especially if Joe Frazier and George
Foreman<00:04:56.310> we're<00:04:57.180> weren't<00:04:57.660> able<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.960> knock<00:04:58.169> out

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
Foreman we're weren't able to knock out

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.469 
Foreman we're weren't able to knock out
Muhammad<00:04:58.860> Ali<00:04:59.100> but<00:04:59.340> hands<00:04:59.640> down<00:04:59.940> I<00:04:59.970> do<00:05:00.150> think

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
Muhammad Ali but hands down I do think

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.810 
Muhammad Ali but hands down I do think
that<00:05:00.800> Marciano<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:02.010> one<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.430> greatest

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
that Marciano is one of the greatest

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.940 
that Marciano is one of the greatest
cruiserweights

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
cruiserweights

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.380 
cruiserweights
cruiserweight<00:05:04.950> /<00:05:05.280> heavyweight<00:05:05.820> champion<00:05:06.330> of

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
cruiserweight / heavyweight champion of

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.050 
cruiserweight / heavyweight champion of
all<00:05:06.510> time<00:05:06.570> because<00:05:07.050> he's<00:05:07.200> barely<00:05:07.440> weighed<00:05:07.710> in

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
all time because he's barely weighed in

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.280 
all time because he's barely weighed in
over<00:05:09.060> 190<00:05:09.510> pounds

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
over 190 pounds

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.710 
over 190 pounds
and<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.620> do<00:05:10.680> think<00:05:10.950> that<00:05:11.190> Ali<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.940> little<00:05:12.600> too

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and I do think that Ali is a little too

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.950 
and I do think that Ali is a little too
big<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.290> little<00:05:13.979> big<00:05:14.160> for<00:05:14.190> him<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.760> not<00:05:15.660> only<00:05:15.690> is

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
big a little big for him and not only is

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.540 
big a little big for him and not only is
he<00:05:15.990> big<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:16.470> he's<00:05:16.560> fast<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.070> he's<00:05:17.160> not<00:05:17.400> gonna

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
he big but he's fast and he's not gonna

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.390 
he big but he's fast and he's not gonna
you<00:05:17.940> know<00:05:18.000> he's<00:05:18.600> not<00:05:18.720> gonna<00:05:18.900> exchange<00:05:19.380> he<00:05:19.590> it's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
you know he's not gonna exchange he it's

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.940 
you know he's not gonna exchange he it's
hard<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.729> hit<00:05:20.910> hit<00:05:21.660> of<00:05:21.840> prime<00:05:22.200> Muhammad<00:05:22.650> Ali

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
hard to hit hit of prime Muhammad Ali

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.370 
hard to hit hit of prime Muhammad Ali
know<00:05:23.700> especially<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.450> know<00:05:24.540> Sonny<00:05:24.900> Liston

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
know especially if you know Sonny Liston

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.950 
know especially if you know Sonny Liston
was<00:05:25.410> barely<00:05:26.220> able<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.729> touch<00:05:27.390> our<00:05:27.660> Lee<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.870> don't

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
was barely able to touch our Lee I don't

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
was barely able to touch our Lee I don't
think<00:05:28.350> Rocky<00:05:28.830> Marciano<00:05:29.010> good

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
think Rocky Marciano good

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.150 
think Rocky Marciano good
be<00:05:30.640> able<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.090> I<00:05:31.120> also<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.440> do<00:05:32.590> think<00:05:32.950> that

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
be able to I also I do think that

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.210 
be able to I also I do think that
Mohammed<00:05:34.000> Ali<00:05:34.240> will<00:05:34.530> just<00:05:35.530> simply<00:05:35.830> outbox

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
Mohammed Ali will just simply outbox

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.030 
Mohammed Ali will just simply outbox
Rocky<00:05:36.550> Marciano<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:37.600> think<00:05:38.560> he<00:05:38.650> was<00:05:38.740> just<00:05:38.830> stay

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
Rocky Marciano I think he was just stay

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.670 
Rocky Marciano I think he was just stay
on<00:05:39.070> his<00:05:39.340> toes<00:05:39.610> just<00:05:40.030> throws<00:05:40.630> on<00:05:40.810> those

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
on his toes just throws on those

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.520 
on his toes just throws on those
multiple<00:05:42.220> left<00:05:42.430> hands<00:05:42.850> and<00:05:43.030> I'm<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.260> then

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
multiple left hands and I'm and then

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.380 
multiple left hands and I'm and then
open<00:05:44.890> up<00:05:45.010> quite<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.520> few<00:05:45.730> times<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.240> think

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
open up quite a few times and I think

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.560 
open up quite a few times and I think
that<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.720> fight<00:05:46.960> within<00:05:48.000> by<00:05:49.000> technical

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
that the fight within by technical

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.390 
that the fight within by technical
knockout<00:05:49.630> of<00:05:50.020> late<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:50.500> probably<00:05:50.890> eight<00:05:51.340> or

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
knockout of late and probably eight or

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.150 
knockout of late and probably eight or
nine<00:05:51.700> on<00:05:52.030> cuts<00:05:52.360> I<00:05:52.630> think<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.500> Marciano<00:05:54.040> will

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
nine on cuts I think that Marciano will

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.270 
nine on cuts I think that Marciano will
get<00:05:54.310> cut<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:55.500> not<00:05:56.500> only<00:05:56.590> will<00:05:56.800> he<00:05:56.890> be<00:05:56.920> cut<00:05:57.250> I

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
get cut and not only will he be cut I

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.490 
get cut and not only will he be cut I
think<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:58.630> would<00:05:58.840> just<00:05:58.900> be<00:05:58.990> at<00:05:59.170> the<00:05:59.200> point

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
think that it would just be at the point

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.380 
think that it would just be at the point
where<00:05:59.620> Muhammad<00:06:00.400> Ali<00:06:00.490> will<00:06:00.730> overwhelming

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
where Muhammad Ali will overwhelming

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.810 
where Muhammad Ali will overwhelming
with<00:06:01.540> shots<00:06:01.810> in<00:06:02.110> he'll<00:06:03.070> probably<00:06:03.250> be<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.520> little

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
with shots in he'll probably be a little

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.540 
with shots in he'll probably be a little
too<00:06:03.940> much<00:06:03.970> for<00:06:04.390> Rocky<00:06:04.570> Marciano<00:06:04.810> because

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
too much for Rocky Marciano because

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.730 
too much for Rocky Marciano because
because<00:06:06.550> I'm<00:06:06.730> especially<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.660> fact<00:06:08.290> that<00:06:08.410> Lee

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
because I'm especially the fact that Lee

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.160 
because I'm especially the fact that Lee
does<00:06:08.980> you<00:06:09.910> know<00:06:10.000> when<00:06:10.210> he<00:06:10.270> opens<00:06:10.630> up<00:06:10.750> this<00:06:10.930> is

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
