00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.560
 very good to everyone how are you amy me 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.140
 and well, here we are again with 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.670
 another new little analysis that in this 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.200
 occasion has touched him in vulgar 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.090
 You already know that I 'm going to go up 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.980
 all because analysis that you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.960
 you are asking me to give equal for example 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.849
 that is a pokemon that is not very 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800
 used in a competitive pokemon 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.060
 because you already know that maybe this 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.490
 pokemon that you are seeing here that is going to 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.220
 be the molo gap that is not that it's a 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.050
 pokémon well used in a little a 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.530
 competitive but good they also have 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.199
 right all these pokemon to be able 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 make analysis of them so as 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.109
 you already know that you have asked me 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.300
 because to rise as analysis molgas 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.859
 here we have it and good as you see in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 murgas a pokémon that is of type 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.309
 Flying electric has two abilities 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.289
 the normal skill that would be 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.850
 static electricity that what it does 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.820
 this skill is that it has a 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 percentage of paralyzing the opponent then 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.790
 if they throw an attack on us and the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.030
 hidden ability of molgas would be electro 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.480
 engine what this skill does is 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.690
 what 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.909
 to speed if they launch an attack 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.640
 electric 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 as you can see in his base stats of this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 Pokemon 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.069
 the strongest point that this has 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 Pokemon is the speed because the rest 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.950
 As you can see, it's not that it's a pokémon 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.679
 that I get to resist a lot as you see 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.319
 has both physical and special attack 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.750
 and well this little bit because I think it 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.509
 uses rather in a special attack 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 no special attack and speed that now 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.399
 I'm going to give you a few attacks that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.049
 we can teach this pokemon the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.969
 best attacks that we can put to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.340
 Strikes would be an air strike that is a 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.640
 Molly egg movement mocks again 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.950
 or wind affine and volt change the best 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.659
 object would definitely be focus band because 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.759
 emol guy and I tell you it's not a little 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.039
 very very resistant and one touch 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.920
 we can die so band focus then 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.390
 will help us to take a turn after 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.160
 to me all the attacks that are put 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.400
 down here that we can also put 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.590
 chop aerial dance rain thunder power 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420
 hidden type ice or earth and the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.700
 object by rock rain to enhance 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 so much rain and band focus too if 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.220
 you want to resist as you are seeing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.070
 here 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.390
 the image that we have released a mirotic 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.550
 or a ray of ice and we have not resisted 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
 and this for me is neither tic 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.810
 not even trained or anything like that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.810
 so you can see that in volga has 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.640
 very little resistance and good because I volt 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.550
 change then in case things are 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.060
 they get ugly so we can go back and get out 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.660
 another pokemon mocks then just in case we 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.000
 they launch an attack the state as toxic or 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 something like that and so we can prevent that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 our opponent then use attack this 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.260
 been again again if you are interested 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.740
 well it's purpose to empower well in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.330
 double fights for example 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.460
 not this speed and all this 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.990
 and well here you are seeing others 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.790
 attacks that we can also put to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.340
 emol guy would be air slit that also 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.590
 the substitute egg movement breathe 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
 voltio change or spark if you prefer 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.060
 the best object for this combination 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.440
 It would be remains, but I'm telling you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.450
 morgan those who resist a lot so 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 band focus also if you want you can 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.430
 put we can use substitutes if 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.500
 we attack earlier if we are faster than 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.080
 our rival and we can go 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 using respite and while so 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.800
 We recover weigh with remains also 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.540
 voltio change as I said before 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.100
 Well to use 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.260
 to try to change 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.380
 of pokemon if things get ugly 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.700
 the best natures that would be for 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.530
 emulate without a doubt is the fearful nature 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.390
 scared because as in Bulgaria is a 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.740
 little where by itself it has its most 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.750
 strong is the speed so with 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.970
 fearful we will strengthen much more its 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.770
 speed there are also people who do 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.720
 morgan modest that we would also go 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.250
 quite well that already depends on the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.500
 tastes of each one although I recommend 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.870
 better a fearful one to enhance her 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.600
 speed in the distribution of the items 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.360
 I would put him since he has little defense 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.270
 no and that is a bit like no 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.280
 resists a lot so put 6 in defense 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.620
 in speed 252 and in special attack 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.080
 252 and well then that's all I hope that 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.730
 I really liked this poke analysis 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.170
 that has been murga that as you know 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.270
 because it could go up all the 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.450
 analysis of the pokemon that you 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.160
 go asking even if it is not a pokémon 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.510
 to use them in poke a competitive 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.110
 although there are good people who use 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.000
 also to in volga and to patxi and up 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.710
 many other pokemon not that they are also 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.660
 pretty good in pokemon 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.420
 pretty tivo but as you know I'll go 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.320
 uploading also mega pokemon 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.390
 evolutions and also because pokemon of what 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.280
 that you want and you know, I hope 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.830
 that you really liked this video and 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.639
 see you in the next video up 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:14.349
 then 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:14.349
 dictates almost not follow me magic card
