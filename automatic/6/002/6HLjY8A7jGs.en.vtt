 The tightening technique itself can be through 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.699
 this operation very gentle 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 what to do for the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.699
 Patients have several advantages to have 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.469
 a very fast one 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.980
 healing process to another but also 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.109
 a much improved result 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.210
 I'm in the clinic this morning 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.449
 on the rhine because i have one this morning 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.490
 I would like to make a small op 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.170
 have the impression and it is not only 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.880
 an impression i see that my skin 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 a little bit less with the tension 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.930
 here on the lower cheeks and in 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.870
 the neck area 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.960
 But I would like to have a very 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.080
 to have a natural result and I am 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.650
 surely thought helped 1 would be wonderful 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.650
 fix 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.750
 the op went very well and did 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.670
 took a total of two hours 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.260
 the patients have the whole time 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 slept deeply and soundly 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.360
 After we start the wall content 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.610
 could have been in connection one 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.940
 petition carried out in the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.330
 Area of the face of the lips and the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.330
 child 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.640
 yes, it's been almost 14 days now 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.159
 and I'm so excited how fast 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.399
 the swelling have gone already 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.860
 So I think that's the one 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.810
 result has become quite great and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.200
 I am surprised that while the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.319
 operation that I totally slept 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 and did not notice anything and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.630
 was allowed to go home the next day 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.030
 and yes okay you meet the first few days 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.380
 you have a bit of a pain but the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.970
 are bearable 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.569
 you get a bit of painkillers 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.640
 with and after a few days one notices 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.519
 that swelling gradually 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.319
 go down and now how you look 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.709
 then the swelling is already gone 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.470
 here's a little bit the one 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.910
 lymph glands here is still a bit 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 a little sworn to 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.440
 but otherwise I can go out now 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.519
 shopping no one thinks anything and it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.709
 It is totally surprising that it is so 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.900
 fast that the cure is so fast 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.840

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.690
 Excited about the result so how 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.769
 looks before has one here this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.049

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 and they are all gone, everything is smooth 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.329
