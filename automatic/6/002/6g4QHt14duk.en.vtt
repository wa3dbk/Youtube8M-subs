00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 read you read it only 80 10 10 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.990
 read with the caps which have been the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 book was through this if we already have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 someone's book against video 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.539
 read in on it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.539
 the books through one after the other 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.220
 Everyone tells something else is something 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 well, you have ten options 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 to try out what suits you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.079
 Maybe everything does not fit that way 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.149
 Great 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.129
 Maybe you can not do it that way 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.570
 a time that and achieve that because 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 it simply does not exist the body 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.000
 because you just were not born for it 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.320
 so and so in no time 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 cardinal a friend's fingers 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 You can train and grow it 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.559
 is then I think also unfair and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 for that reason before and say what the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 says something else and these books 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 a year 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.150
 because the dalit set offered which one is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 the holy grail wants to go too 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.439
 sell and with him it will work in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.400
 couple and the studies say yes but in 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.080
 say the other book you have 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.229
 perfect is because the studies on it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
 Showing creditworthiness or being one another 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.159
 yes synonymous just so that there is no 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 chance with a polin in almost already 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.070
 muscles on so and so is just the whole 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 Money flowed as a whole game of fitness 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.250
 meanwhile, that's how everybody hunts 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 bound on his opinion that must be so 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 and so on I am also world 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 come only to learn locally 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.000
 even if it then times 9000 hours on 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.100
 worked best with most 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.259
 I also have orders 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.880
 wanted to train capri course is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.509
 it does not have that fit for you for 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.700
 the 80 to 10 to 10 c 83 10 percent 10 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.970
 proteins render video made for 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.830
 makes you fit it is all just help 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.200
 and signposts are not gods 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.940
 know exactly what is going on nobody nobody 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.220
 in form no one writes the book 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.770
 no commission also does not write 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.450
 not okay then you should praise 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.580
 go there is a renzel 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.600
 I would say there are no local ones 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.190
 limit calories there is a limit with 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.620
 That's why the calories are really that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.800
 right so theoretically 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.230
 completely put a life without bringing 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.310
 endless simply the fat 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.019
 screwed up protein high and cabbage 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.910
 Raterunde is Diana who became him 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.400
 example you can live partly 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.880
 Muscles can survive 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.170
 build up 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.930
 you can you survive separately 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.069
 as the mainstream of the situation is 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.330
 not that customers are bad 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.250
 I 'm just saying you can theoretically 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.110
 happy customer had life it is about 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.260
 Calories then screw it back 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.510
 Why must you get hungry in both? 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.000
 programs fall at the end are several 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.500
 argument he does not fight in the end 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.500
 necessarily because of the carbs 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.190
 but that would have been low right it 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.440
 yes, one down and you have to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.820
 state your calories and you can 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.320
 also with fat makes yes there you feel 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.900
 maybe unfortunately it falls for the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320
 hormone balance responsible for that I say 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.299
 times 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.180
 who are weak a lot for a little too hard 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.250
 is do a bit of avocado may 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.690
 natural peanut butter but not 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:18.739
 empty but do not shovel two dice 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.380
 coach change on castle hradcany even 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.360
 but natural two spoons on 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.460
 Day 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.470
 extremely weak will be better 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.890
 feel it is not always up to the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.570
 content of carbohydrates 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 That's why it can be the weapon before everyone 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.860
