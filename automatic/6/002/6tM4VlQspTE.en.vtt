stood the test of time these twenty
students<00:01:07.380> needed<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.250> modern<00:01:08.729> computers<00:01:09.479> to

create<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.380> home<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> team<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.240> was

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
create a home for this team it was

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
create a home for this team it was
really<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> great<00:01:12.990> challenge<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.530> us<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
really a great challenge for us to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
really a great challenge for us to
create<00:01:15.330> animation<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.710> seen

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
create animation it was going to be seen

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
create animation it was going to be seen
by<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.520> wide<00:01:18.000> range<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.720> Ages<00:01:18.930> after<00:01:19.470> we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
by a wide range of Ages after we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
by a wide range of Ages after we
developed<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> model<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> textures

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
developed the model and the textures

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
developed the model and the textures
they<00:01:22.290> rigged<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> character<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> gave<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
they rigged the character and gave it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
they rigged the character and gave it
the<00:01:24.150> bones<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.750> since<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the bones and since we do have the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.050 
the bones and since we do have the
skeleton<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> pretty<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.610> guess<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
skeleton we have a pretty good guess of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.310 
skeleton we have a pretty good guess of
how<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> bones<00:01:27.450> actually<00:01:27.659> worked

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
how the bones actually worked

how the bones actually worked
students<00:01:28.829> sketched<00:01:29.159> scan<00:01:29.820> took<00:01:30.180> pictures<00:01:30.659> and

students sketched scan took pictures and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.740 
students sketched scan took pictures and
discussed<00:01:31.619> how<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> interpret<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.180> facts<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
discussed how to interpret the facts to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.899 
discussed how to interpret the facts to
bring<00:01:33.960> Jane<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.619> life<00:01:34.829> especially<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.729> one

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bring Jane to life especially for one

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
bring Jane to life especially for one
person<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.810> tough<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
person it's really tough to do all the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
person it's really tough to do all the
aspects<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> animation<00:01:41.820> usually<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.659> done

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
aspects of animation usually it's done

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.800 
aspects of animation usually it's done
in<00:01:43.140> teams<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.240> would<00:01:45.570> take

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
in teams think about this it would take

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.100 
in teams think about this it would take
one<00:01:46.290> person<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.100> year<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> complete<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.630> minute

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

one person a year to complete one minute
of<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.590> animation<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.329> good<00:01:51.570> these

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
of this animation that's how good these

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.830 
of this animation that's how good these
guys<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.890> whole<00:01:53.040> idea<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
guys are the whole idea of all all the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
guys are the whole idea of all all the
effort<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.710> into<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.909> show

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
effort that's put into it is to not show
