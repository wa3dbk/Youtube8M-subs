00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 circle tv and today we will have a video on 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.410
 nashorn and necessarily soon 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.330
 there will be a video on t-34 85 m103 i'm fine 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.240
 I see that you write in the comments and I 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.430
 I hope that I have all these cars that you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.710
 I will consider it interesting again and I hope 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.920
 in more detail and so we don’t have a nasher 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 car that stands on the seventh level 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.250
 as I remember, and she is very 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.700
 not bad for this level because 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.829
 has a gun like a royal tiger 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 88 centimeters with 4.7 recharge 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.809
 seconds which is pretty fast though before 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.780
 it was even faster and acceptable information 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.510
 in 2.8 seconds this is if you spin a lot 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.730
 just breaking through with us at the shell pretty 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.239
 a good 200 odd units 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.670
 Well, gold 234 and this is enough to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 fight all through level nine up 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 tanks and including any problem in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.350
 you with this will not occur one-time damage 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.690
 400 units gun overall very nice 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.119
 and because she's definitely pretty fast 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.869
 comes down put on the principle quite good 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.450
 one-time damage 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.520
 problem and rough in the other it is absolutely 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 does not have booked it open house 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.680
 30 millimeters forehead hull 20 bead and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 food is not suitable absolutely nowhere 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.500
 here is such a verse 1450 hit points here 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 which is also not much because 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.820
 one of you will take 2 buns 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 if he is lucky and that is certainly not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 there is good because you fight off the projectile 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.329
 not by speed this car is very 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 not bad but with the first engine she drives 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.689
 like the last toilet and have to put 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 top engine 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.939
 By the way on the last building you can not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 waste of experience because it's nothing 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.210
 actually almost does not give except for 30 extra 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.340
 hit points 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 Well, maybe they are superfluous and will not be but all 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.540
 due to 30 hit points rock the body 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.079
 the next one is somehow silly little easier 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.689
 to put 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.030
 module hitpoint and by the way modulo 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.640
 what to put to put of course as 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.340
 always rammer module can be put 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.320
 on hit points and you can put rammer 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.659
 fight rammer forgive 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.720
 I can talk with 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.060
 After all institution and still drives aiming this 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.830
 will make your gun even more pleasant in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.650
 reversal although in principle you can 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.360
 do only a rammer and optional 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.250
 put more and modules at hitpoint and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 which will not be superfluous here 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.970
 you can also put enlightened 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.799
 optics to see further 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.620
 because review our early in principle 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.989
 pretty good here is such a car with 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.150
 a very nice tool for lack of armor 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.940
 she is big so put on her 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.250
 you certainly can’t shoot back 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.170
 lines to try or surreptitiously in every 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.870
 case of enemy projectiles for sure 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.450
 on this unit is not necessary and even you yourself 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 understand it very very quickly in this 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.920
 the car is rather weak because of a one-off 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260
 damage to waste on it is not an option in 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.319
 many cars on the seventh level one-time 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 damage is higher and your armor will not sustain them 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.620
 hits your number of hit points 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.290
 not conducive to your 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.269
 longevity so we shoot from 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.970
 some kind of shelters or because of their 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.099
 allies and of course do not forget that 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.900
 that our dpm team always come in handy 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.209
 because stand in the bushes and the whole battle is not 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.099
 worth it if you do not see the enemy too 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.810
 better to risk and help the team than 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.730
 then merge last without 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.459
 allies here is such an interesting 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.230
 pretty car on it probably can not 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 all the same show over some cool 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.030
 results on how far she is 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.340
 imba but still it is very good 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 and of course everyone probably has their own 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.799
 opinion on each unit but personally mine 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.280
 I do not put a solid 4 and a half 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.049
 out of 5 points just because all the same 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.940
 it is difficult to play on in the sense that 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.880
 There is absolutely no armor and punches 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.740
 absolutely any 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.420
 yes, maybe third level and and 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.610
 will strike yes even the first level and and 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.530
 will break through here so you have to play 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.660
 neatly but just get used to it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.300
 style of play on such a big bucket 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.000
 the case here is very similar to the case 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.370
 from the artillery mount hummel and in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.650
 Generally this highway this body so 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.680
 let's say it was just used with different 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.420
 guns here we are gun 88 centimeters 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.730
 also apparently put and howitzer 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.340
 gun well this is Hummel of course 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.230
 This is how much a car was called 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.940
 since I have already repeated it I do not know but 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.030
 I hope you enjoy it when you 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.150
 you will pass it but it is not in principle 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.550
 much worse jagdpanthery and quite a 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.170
 you might like me too 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.930
 I hope because I like it in principle 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.520
 like yes there are drawbacks but u 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.100
 Any car must have its own 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.620
 disadvantages and their advantages are here 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.300
 of course there are, well have you been 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.790
 crew gt hope this video was 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.480
 informative all bye bye see you soon 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.480
 meeting
