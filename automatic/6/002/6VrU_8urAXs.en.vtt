every 180 here of our chest calm today
we've<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.759> new<00:00:11.759> design<00:00:12.090> series<00:00:12.450> 48<00:00:12.990> for

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
we've got the new design series 48 for

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.160 
we've got the new design series 48 for
48<00:00:13.200> inch<00:00:13.920> square<00:00:14.549> tables<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.120> show<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> each

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
48 inch square tables to show you each

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
48 inch square tables to show you each
table<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:17.039> actually<00:00:17.400> run<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> plug<00:00:18.090> or

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
table can actually run on a plug or

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.830 
table can actually run on a plug or
rechargeable<00:00:19.080> battery<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.520> large

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
rechargeable battery there is a large

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
rechargeable battery there is a large
battery<00:00:21.840> box<00:00:22.170> located<00:00:23.010> under<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> table<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
battery box located under the table that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
battery box located under the table that
you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> battery<00:00:26.400> will<00:00:26.550> run

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you can see here the battery will run

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
you can see here the battery will run
these<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.720> around<00:00:27.869> 15<00:00:28.619> hours<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> single

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
these for around 15 hours on a single

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
these for around 15 hours on a single
charge<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.779> easily<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.289> through<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
charge so you can easily get through a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
charge so you can easily get through a
single<00:00:31.890> day<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.460> depends<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
single day it really depends on the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.250 
single day it really depends on the
conditions<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> lighting<00:00:33.989> modes<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
conditions and the lighting modes you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.229 
conditions and the lighting modes you
have<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
have it on and that can go up or down a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:36.979 
have it on and that can go up or down a
little<00:00:36.480> bit

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
little bit

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.670 
little bit
also<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.860> tables<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.430> change<00:00:38.670> colors<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
also the tables can change colors and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
also the tables can change colors and
they<00:00:40.680> operate<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> remote<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.940> point

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they operate on a remote you just point

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.319 
they operate on a remote you just point
clip<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:46.340> there<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.640> red

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
clip for really one and there are red

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
clip for really one and there are red
blue<00:00:48.600> green<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> every<00:00:49.230> shade<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.070> I'm

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
blue green and every shade up so I'm

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
blue green and every shade up so I'm
going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> change<00:00:51.090> something<00:00:51.539> three<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.930> them

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
going to change something three of them

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260 
going to change something three of them
set<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.649> change<00:00:52.969> each<00:00:53.969> one

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
set up here I'm gonna change each one

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 
set up here I'm gonna change each one
separately<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.289> they're<00:00:55.469> nice<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> green

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
separately so they're nice and green

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.599 
separately so they're nice and green
I<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.850> slowly<00:00:57.059> make<00:00:57.360> those<00:00:57.539> greens<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:58.609> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
I can slowly make those greens out just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
I can slowly make those greens out just
like<00:00:59.760> so<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.710> get<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.890> different<00:01:02.039> shades

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
like so and get into different shades

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
like so and get into different shades
same<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> red<00:01:03.120> after<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> lot

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650

that's<00:01:38.070> kind<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> fast<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.390> adjust

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
that's kind of fast so I can also adjust

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700 
that's kind of fast so I can also adjust
the<00:01:39.960> speed<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:42.380> be<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.530> more

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

is a red blue green mix and mt9 you can

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.389 
is a red blue green mix and mt9 you can
just<00:01:58.479> those<00:01:58.600> speeds<00:01:59.039> and<00:02:00.039> then<00:02:00.189> we<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.369> a

just those speeds and then we have a

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.179 
just those speeds and then we have a
seven<00:02:00.939> color<00:02:01.090> fade<00:02:04.679> couple<00:02:05.679> more<00:02:05.829> options<00:02:06.130> you
