well<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:03.309> like<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.699> last<00:01:04.089> here<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:05.410> time<00:01:05.620> i

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
well just like the last here this time i

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.950 
well just like the last here this time i
have<00:01:06.040> created<00:01:06.310> slightly<00:01:07.180> more<00:01:07.360> videos<00:01:07.720> i
