surface coating now to get started the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.959 
surface coating now to get started the
coating<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.399> kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> matte<00:00:35.700> black<00:00:35.850> finish

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
coating is kind of a matte black finish

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.869 
coating is kind of a matte black finish
over<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> rim<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.190> an<00:00:38.280> elevated<00:00:38.640> ring

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
over the rim and it's an elevated ring

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
over the rim and it's an elevated ring
within<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.750> footage<00:00:40.079> applied<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
within that like footage applied to the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
within that like footage applied to the
top<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> axle<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> surface

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
top of it so that's the axle of surface

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
top of it so that's the axle of surface
coating<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:43.950> two<00:00:44.070> great<00:00:44.250> things

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
coating now there's two great things

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.920 
coating now there's two great things
about<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.850> coating<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.800> wheel

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
about this coating one is the wheel

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
about this coating one is the wheel
looks<00:00:48.930> fantastic<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.180> color

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
looks fantastic as you can see the color

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
looks fantastic as you can see the color
the<00:00:51.750> black<00:00:51.899> color<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> wheel<00:00:52.559> matches<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the black color of the wheel matches a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
the black color of the wheel matches a
black<00:00:53.160> color<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> tire<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
black color the tire and I think it's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.029 
black color the tire and I think it's
one<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> best-looking<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.860> set

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
one of the best-looking will set

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.160 
one of the best-looking will set
something<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> second

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
something like it down now the second

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
something like it down now the second
thing<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.300> excellent<00:01:00.300> surface

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
thing about that excellent surface

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
thing about that excellent surface
coating<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> doesn't<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.550> but

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
coating is it doesn't just look good but

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.729 
coating is it doesn't just look good but
it's<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.320> functionally<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.530> very

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it's actually functionally very very

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's actually functionally very very
good<00:01:04.949> because<00:01:05.840> they've<00:01:06.840> applied<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.590> special

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
good because they've applied a special

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
good because they've applied a special
coat<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> brake<00:01:09.060> surface<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:10.080> there's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
coat of the brake surface where there's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.679 
coat of the brake surface where there's
you<00:01:10.920> look<00:01:11.070> very<00:01:11.220> closely<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you look very closely you can see this

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.170 
you look very closely you can see this
tiny<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.170> bruised<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> surface<00:01:14.340> now

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
tiny little bruised in the surface now

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.429 
tiny little bruised in the surface now
all<00:01:15.360> those<00:01:15.479> tiny<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.750> grooves<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
all those tiny little grooves there is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.380 
all those tiny little grooves there is
they<00:01:16.560> dissipate<00:01:17.100> dissipate<00:01:17.310> heat<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.299> well

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
they dissipate dissipate heat very well

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.370 
they dissipate dissipate heat very well
and<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:21.000> enables<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.750> brake<00:01:21.990> burger

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and and that enables your brake burger

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
and and that enables your brake burger

now we have carbon spokes on this will
now<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> excellent<00:02:05.430> surface<00:02:05.610> coating<00:02:06.030> has<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
now the excellent surface coating has a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
now the excellent surface coating has a
bit<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> weight<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.200> they're<00:02:07.829> kind<00:02:08.039> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
bit of weight now that they're kind of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.790 
bit of weight now that they're kind of
offsetting<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.300> weight<00:02:09.479> while<00:02:10.110> using<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
offsetting that weight while using the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080 
offsetting that weight while using the
carbon<00:02:10.979> spokes<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.580> cycle<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:11.910> they're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
carbon spokes on this cycle so they're

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.530 
carbon spokes on this cycle so they're
very

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
very

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.509 
very
taking<00:02:12.750> very<00:02:12.900> big<00:02:13.049> carbon<00:02:13.290> spoke<00:02:13.620> now<00:02:14.219> in<00:02:14.459> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
taking very big carbon spoke now in the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.920 
taking very big carbon spoke now in the
past<00:02:14.730> people<00:02:14.969> had<00:02:15.150> issues<00:02:15.269> with<00:02:15.569> carbon

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
past people had issues with carbon

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.770 
past people had issues with carbon
spokes<00:02:16.170> years<00:02:16.560> ago<00:02:16.799> with<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.219> RCS<00:02:17.519> wheels

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
spokes years ago with the RCS wheels

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.819 
spokes years ago with the RCS wheels
we've<00:02:18.780> heard<00:02:18.930> none<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.500> last<00:02:19.530> few

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
we've heard none of that in the last few

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.550 
we've heard none of that in the last few
years<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> new<00:02:20.969> carbon<00:02:21.180> spokes<00:02:21.569> work<00:02:22.260> fine

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
years so the new carbon spokes work fine

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
years so the new carbon spokes work fine
there's<00:02:22.859> no<00:02:22.980> problems<00:02:23.370> they're<00:02:23.760> totally<00:02:24.120> fine

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
there's no problems they're totally fine

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.479 
there's no problems they're totally fine
to<00:02:24.390> use<00:02:24.540> interestingly<00:02:25.409> though<00:02:25.859> they<00:02:26.159> are<00:02:26.340> on

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
to use interestingly though they are on

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.789 
to use interestingly though they are on
the<00:02:26.609> non-drive<00:02:26.909> side<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.079> most<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.530> lot<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.739> the

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
the non-drive side so most a lot of the

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.920 
the non-drive side so most a lot of the
power<00:02:29.040> transfer<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:29.879> come<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.329> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
power transfer will come to the the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
power transfer will come to the the
drive<00:02:31.200> side<00:02:31.439> here<00:02:31.739> which<00:02:32.310> uses<00:02:32.849> an<00:02:33.060> aluminum

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
drive side here which uses an aluminum

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.699 
drive side here which uses an aluminum
spoke<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.739> straight<00:02:35.069> bladed<00:02:35.370> straight-pull

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
spoke so straight bladed straight-pull

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.819 
spoke so straight bladed straight-pull
blade<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.920> spoke<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:39.480> havock<00:02:39.810> wheels<00:02:40.019> all

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
blade and spoke now havock wheels all

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.800 
blade and spoke now havock wheels all
now<00:02:41.189> come<00:02:41.489> with<00:02:41.639> a<00:02:41.819> theis<00:02:42.180> wheel<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.689> tie

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
now come with a theis wheel and tie

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.199 
now come with a theis wheel and tie
system<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.439> it's<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.340> specific<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
system so it's on the specific a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.559 
system so it's on the specific a
specific<00:02:45.709> type<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.980> red<00:02:47.189> and<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:48.090> specific

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
specific type of the red and a specific

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.809 
specific type of the red and a specific
type<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.959> front<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.370> makes<00:02:50.639> them

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
type of the front so that makes them

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.879 
type of the front so that makes them
slightly<00:02:51.810> better<00:02:51.959> valued<00:02:52.379> when<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.709> factor

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
slightly better valued when you factor

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.020 
slightly better valued when you factor
in<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.220> fact<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.549> you're<00:02:53.700> getting<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.000> be

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
in the fact that you're getting to be

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.589
