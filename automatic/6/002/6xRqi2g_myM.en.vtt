is about 50% more of this 50% of this
outsole<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:59.019> an<00:02:59.230> air<00:02:59.409> bag<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.889> it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
outsole is actually an air bag so it

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.720 
outsole is actually an air bag so it
covers<00:03:00.220> about<00:03:01.319> 75%<00:03:02.319> more<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.340> midsole

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
while also reducing the weight because

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.220 
while also reducing the weight because

you have less materials far in the boot
more<00:03:14.230> cushioning<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.889> great<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.549> impact<00:03:16.000> any

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
more cushioning is great for impact any

laying a hard jump stuff like that it's

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.409 
laying a hard jump stuff like that it's
going<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.500> absorb<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:20.980> shock<00:03:21.269> absorbed<00:03:22.269> that
