00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.589
 description and then you go up here 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 on tools on firmware 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.409
 Update then I go here 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 you can always search 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.880
 prank is for it 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.500
 on the let the last few percent 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.600
 Incidentally, it can take a little longer than 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.980
 those as the previous percentages 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.360
 needed and when he is cold now 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 display such a dialog at the e3 becomes 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.840
 I just started 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.740
 little ever from the computer out 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.960
 pulled or removed because it is one 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.360
 bug gives so if it is recognized 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.700
 or so that he will not be recognized if 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 he updates the first time at night 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.950
 Incidentally, connected will take over 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.930
 I can not guarantee that this will happen 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.150
 Everything works and if it works 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.860
 Then I will break you 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.490
 buy no new eva 3 but you can 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.870
 not 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.080
 Of course you can always do that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 official access from the common 43 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.820
 a stone decides the ev3 I have to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.100

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.370
 firmware has now synonymous again 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.400
 full 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.430

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.459
 internet over or via wlan with the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.070
 computer connects and I use it 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.980
