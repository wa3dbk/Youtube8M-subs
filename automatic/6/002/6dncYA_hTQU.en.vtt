00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.550
 segments will be shown in slow motion 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.290

 start and end 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 to increase or decrease in the area of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.170
 video that I'll be producing in slow motion 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.820
 we have to keep pressing on the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.320
 position that we like 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.800
 we choose the one we like the most 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.780

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.780
 to any point of the video 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 we put the yellow arrow on the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.620

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.940
 the segments as we want and in addition 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.940

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.960
 him and then about eliminate 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.269
