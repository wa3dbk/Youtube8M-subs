00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.340
 Grab your monkey wrench, 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.980
 and say no to cocaine, 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.100
 because we are going to UNBLOCK! 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.600
 [INTRO MUSIC] 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hello, internet 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.540
 and welcome to Game Theory! 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.240
 Gamings tangential educational experience! 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.520
 Since last week, the first episode on theoretical physics, a BIT has been hard, 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 Today we are going to clarify things 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.880
 by spending time at the world's most famous unblocker, 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 Mario ... 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.220
 Uh ... 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.540
 Mario. 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.060
 But, 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.940
 what do we REALLY know about this international mysterious man? 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.800
 Nintendo has pulled the wool over the eyes of Western audiences 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.860
 about Mario's REAL origins? 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.380
 Let's discover it. 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.420
 Mario's FIRST career was a ... 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.660
 CARPENTER... 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 Running on girders to stop evil monkeys in "Donkey Kong." 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.140
 It was only in 1983 arcade game "Mario Brothers," 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.880
 that he got his start as an Italian-American plumber in New York. 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.840
 Here Mario - and brother, Luigi - must fight turtles, crabs, and flies. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.140
 wandering through the pipelines. 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 So, as someone currently living in New York, 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.320
 and assuming that flying in a sewer is a given, 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 I ask: Are there really turtles and crabs running through the pipes of the city? 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 Well, let's start with the crabs. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000
 The long winters of New York, 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 and the AL contaminated and cold conditions of the sewer, 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.920
 it would be quite challenging for a crab to survive there. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.900
 However, in ITALY, with its warmer climate, 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.080
 Can crabs in the sewer be dated back to the year 100. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.740
 When Emperor Trajan imported crabs from Macedonia, 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.960
 and set them free in the center of town for him, as part of a Pagan crab festival. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 Those who escaped and flourished in the sewer 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420
 and to this day, they are called "Trajan Krabben" - 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.520
 - scratching sewer. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.180
 But what about the turtles? 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.580
 And NO, these turtles do not count. 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.480
 Although specific data is rare, 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.740
 It is generally believed that the cool, dark and bacteria-ridden conditions of the sewer 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 prevent cold-blooded animals, such as turtles, from surviving underground and reproducing. 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.880
 However, there IS another side to the story. 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.600
 Volksmond is full of stories about unwanted pets being flushed in toilets, 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.120
 and later bloom in the sewer. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.320
 According to Robert Daley's "The World Beneath the City" 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.800
 In 1935 it was known that New York sewers contained crocodiles, 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.660
 And there are now several reports about the animals being caught on city streets. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.800
 As recent as 2006 in Brooklyn. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.820
 BUT, the most striking of them all, in Alexandria, Australia, 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.360
 rescuers found a rare American snapping turtle 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960
 - which they nicknamed. "Cowabunga" - live in the sewers. 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.200
 Looks familiar? 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.800
 So, 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.040
 In the end there might be something ... 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.280
 Returning to our portly plumber's adventures in "Super Mario Bros" games, 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.460
 our red-clad hero finds himself in the Mushroom Kingdom. 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.960
 A plumbing paradise of pipes, 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.700
 hidden with fire-breathing weeds and extensive brick sewers. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.500
 I originally wanted to find out if it is possible to clean pipes using fireballs, 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 because it looks like that is Mario's only plumbing technique, 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.760
 but Google search for "weed (pipes) in pipes" 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520
 did not give me exactly what I was looking for. 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.080
 But I finally found this fact: 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.320
 Pets are not the only things that are flushed in the toilets. 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.340
 Another popular popular story about New York sewers in the 60s 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.360
 was that of "New York White." 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.580
 A particularly powerful albino strain of marijuana 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.900
 grows from seeds in 'pot bags' 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.840
 they were flushed in the toilets during drug raids. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.240
 Unfortunately, this was never a verification. 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.500
 Probably due to the crocodiles and mutated turtles that guard their supplies. 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.680
 But, at a somewhat related point, 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.780
 last month 39 pounds of pot was found that clogged up the sewer system in Arizona. 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.900
 So, maybe Mario had some ulterior motives 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.280
 when he fired the weed in those green tubes. 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.580
 Speaking of green pipes, 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.280
 That's a strange color for a pipe, right? 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.420
 Not really. 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.900
 First, many tubes are made of copper, 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.680
 and copper exposed to moisture oxidizes, 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.640
 creating a green patina on the surface. 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.500
 For a classic example, just look at the Statue of Liberty. 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.740
 So, all pipes can be in the Mushroom Kingdom 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.620
 all are copper, which is just a little bit outdated, 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.780
 But there is another explanation. 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.960
 With the green movement in full swing, 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.120
 more and more companies that make their products in a so-called "eco-friendly color." 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.860
 For example, the German company "Aquatherm" 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.180
 has built their reputation for a unique product line: 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.360
 The appropriately named "GreenPipe." 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.000
 A final note about Super Mario Brothers: 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.120
 Notice how the underground parts of the game take place in brick sewers? 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.940
 Well, Nintendo was lucky in the decision that Mario is from New York. 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.300
 If he were from somewhere else, they would have been wrong, 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.420
 considering that clay was the dominant material for pipes 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.000
 when sewers were first installed - shortly after the Civil War, 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.240
 and cast iron then became a popular choice. 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.160
 New York sewers, on the other hand, are indeed brick, 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.140
 Under the influence of Europeans, 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.880
 who switched to brick systems 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.560
 after a tragic experience with lead pipes, 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.700
 Perhaps (lead) contributed to a shorter life expectancy. 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.200
 This underground architecture, much still in use, 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.260
 closely resembles a number of sewer designs that appear in later Mario games. 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.180
 -like in Super Mario RPG. 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.660
 And on that note, 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.600
 [DID YOU KNOW...] 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.520
 In the forest maze of Super Mario RPG, 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.460
 Mario experiences a different kind of pipe. 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.040
 Log pipes - they function very similarly to the normal green version. 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.280
 Surprisingly, we start looking abroad again for a real world example. 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.720
 Because maybe already in the 13th century, 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.040
 people in England used hollowed tree trunks for water pipelines. 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 In the end the Americans took over the idea, 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.600
 and installed wooden pipes in the early 1800s 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640
 [NOW YOU KNOW IT...] 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.300
 And now it's time for my last thought. 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.760
 We grew up believing what Nintendo has always told us, 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.920
 that Mario is a true Italian-American thoroughbred from New York who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom! 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.920
 But what we have seen here today could point in a different direction. 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.940
 We learned that crabs run in the sewers of Italy, 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.100
 and that turtles have a better chance of survival in sewer conditions with warmer climates. 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.860
 Now we know that a leading green pipeline manufacturer has a headquarters in Germany, 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.280
 and that stone pipelines and agricultural systems 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.360
 can usually be found in old European cities 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.060
 So what does this tell us? 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.240
 Only this: 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.760
 That our Italian - '' American '' unblocker actually has fewer American connections than we thought 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.940
 and that - perhaps - the Mushroom Kingdom can actually be found in the Old Continent. 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.160
 As a final nail in Mario's coffin, 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.580
 As anyone in New York can tell you, 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.540
 No REAL New Yorker would be found dead with brightly colored clothing. 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:05.060
 His showy red robe is much more suited to the fru-fru styling of a European man. 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.500
 Anyway, 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.940
 Is it just a theory 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.480
 A Game Theory! 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.660
 Thanks for looking!
