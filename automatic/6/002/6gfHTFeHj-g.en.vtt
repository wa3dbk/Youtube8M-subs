years

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.890 
years
and<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.799> control<00:01:19.220> for<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.549> eyes<00:01:19.790> is<00:01:20.390> on

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
and then the control for the eyes is on

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.490 
and then the control for the eyes is on
the<00:01:21.049> back<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.530> head<00:01:21.710> stick<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.930> he's<00:01:23.930> got

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the back of the head stick and he's got

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.570 
the back of the head stick and he's got
all<00:01:24.680> around<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.250> movement<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.290> I<00:01:27.290> just<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.340> just

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
all around I movement and I just I just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.810 
all around I movement and I just I just
think<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.350> one<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.530> best<00:01:30.830> controlled

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
think this is one of the best controlled

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.670 
think this is one of the best controlled
figures<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.930> can<00:01:33.170> get<00:01:33.860> today<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.380> that's
