00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone knows this mr bourdin 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.970
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.780
 new video of the back on minecraft is 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.660
 so here I'm going to do a little tutorial 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 agility course on how to destroy the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 claim bases in multiplayer so clear 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.519
 for those who do not know it's the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.910
 bases that are protected so the cube 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 all have to destroy them so there DHR 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.770
 there is the system got disguised in the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.350
 jelly does but we will redo it together 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.340
 do not worry and there is just a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340
 man the torture is stone 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.970
 alas alas you quietly enter 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.240
 and you can do that on all 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.220
 walls of the base and then that's what 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.540
 more basic the genres so here is so 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.310
 we will do it again I do not know if there is any 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:13.650
 who saw the system there were some who had to 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:23.470
 their peril so I think we'll do 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:24.760
 like that for it to be proof I already 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.790
 did a video on it but has 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.479
 do el atrache in napa crash the mountains 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 minecraft so hangs its part reached 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 but good brief 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.939
 2 so there you take a wooden thing I 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.549
 do you put in late or no matter 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:57.360
 what else was putting a piston like 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.429
 that on and a piston like this so in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.049
 big it must give his voice since all 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:08.700
 like that on there you put a stud 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.190
 from here with a lever there a notice because 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 that in fact it does not take a lever to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:24.330
 the two pistons but a lever for 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 each track here after the TNT you the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.630
 put the duo look you want 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.569
 still at home again you put that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:42.579
 huh 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.579
 full hop 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.510
 it must do it ah yes shit if it does 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.510
 too much and so his parents 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:03.660
 that's why you do not know why but 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.960
 I want to piss you off but 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.260
 I'm going to do a double thickness like 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.260
 that at least 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.959
 so that can be very useful it's not 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.909
 done to piss off late there they will get 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.640
 to say yeah that's a bit naked because the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.480
 other tests we pay cash and all 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.930
 what we will have one and trine is 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.459
 entirely their bases 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.159
 I agree 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.079
 completely okay but now that's it 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.310
 what is it right after you are not 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.310
 obliged to do it on all bases 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.660
 you must not be moron and get it 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.420
 on the sinne after so here's what 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.500
 it's good and the TNT which in my eyes is 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.500
 there on that one we will do 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.220
 so if he told the police to do 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:07.180
 better a misstep do it again because 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.180
 otherwise no it's not going to work 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.409
 its good 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:29.840
 so that's ashton who is expected 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:35.000
 pose here and there it's going to boom shaqif 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.260
 Jacky hi i like so I see so 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.120

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 so here is bombay after my next 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.389

 that I was doing my video presentation of 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.240
 the team and I think I'm going to say 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.910
 also that I choose a video how 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.160
 download erase a capture I believe 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.669

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.430
