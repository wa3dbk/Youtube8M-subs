00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.840
 it's an old gala 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.820
 What's up, people? 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.610
 I could be welcome to another day here. 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.050
 on the channel to see you and this time personal 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.250
 or introduce you to a texture 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 superfine texture to one supergene and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.260
 a new way is that you are seeing that you have 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.880
 two cameras now I'll try to do 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 more or less this in my videos etc 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.100
 cause a different business than right 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.440
 many and October and only make the way 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.079
 normal, that you show so with this 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.970
 camera here you are showing texture 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.700
 but with two cameras it looks even better 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.260
 It makes me even more fun to watch the video. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.760
 It just got much better so these are 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 the armor is not 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.510
 many people have asked me as you do 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.670
 saw the beginning of the video 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.600
 this texture and I'm here to show 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.020
 For you guys, to make one just to show. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.670
 even before you come down or 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.619
 I do not know if it's going to have a goal 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.539
 I do not think I will start training description 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.420
 all right for you 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.740
 and then these are the armors and let's go 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.979
 to the next and if it is the panels 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.529
 of items that are the items I'm going to 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.270
 show you guys real fast 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:33.409
 You can land the video to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.529
 You'll see better. 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.459
 I liked it a lot, it was not me who did it. 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:41.659
 this texture who made it was a Japanese 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:45.319
 Japanese even though it seems incredible 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.149
 So it was the Japanese and that's it. 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:54.000
 that particles the name of the guy who made 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:58.210
 Of course you have to talk is the sookie 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.429
 and these are the channel particles it goes 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 have the description if they want to see a channel 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.960
 chinese are not sorry japanese 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.429
 you do not understand Japanese can require 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.120
 also because they do it does 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:22.540
 very nice assemblies and will proceed only 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:23.560
 which are one of the day's shifts or the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.260
 night 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.000
 does not change much from default 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.709
 The rain does not have to show to you. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.870
 I already think it was already raining 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.920
 I do not know but it does not have much difference in 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 rain than normal 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.890
 here is just to change the isi propitious and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 blah blah blah creative same and here it is 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.890
 sword for you to see you see 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.950
 the particles 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:54.180
 Let's just leave the mall has everything 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.180
 a Japanese environment in them they saw themselves 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.220
 of malls in an entire Japanese air like this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 hurt with this ball 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.690
 He wants peace and love. 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.480
 we 're just the one in here 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.910
 be able to take a look at the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:28.840
 stops but show all here 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:34.870
 formally for you of wood and stone 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:38.549
 diamond that has the pt is there, right? 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.139
 pretty well alone gold 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.950
 so I guess that 's it folks not yet 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.739
 have to show the glue or mules 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.769
 and here we have ore people that piece 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.099
 blue and gold there has the coal here has 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.989
 redstone that has where the mother arrives in a 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.120
 iron has nothing outstanding to us 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.489
 You know I do not like much of a highlight. 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.769
 If you want to stand there, 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.630
 It's because I do not really like people. 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.180
 a highlight like this 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.810
 for me I like block color type 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.150
 so you can already differentiate with 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.730
 with these agreements that already 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.290
 well in my opinion I do not 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.790
 I use these highlights very much 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.739
 So I think it's a lot of people. 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.170

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.760
