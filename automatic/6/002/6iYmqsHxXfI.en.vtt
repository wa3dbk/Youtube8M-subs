these<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.830> landing<00:01:28.159> gears<00:01:28.370> like<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.940> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
these the landing gears like this and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.600 
these the landing gears like this and
then<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.470> will<00:01:30.620> just<00:01:30.650> come<00:01:30.920> right<00:01:31.070> out<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.280> it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
then it will just come right out and it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.899 
then it will just come right out and it
just<00:01:31.820> attaches<00:01:31.909> by<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:33.650> little<00:01:33.950> peg<00:01:34.700> right

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
just attaches by this little peg right

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.960 
just attaches by this little peg right
here<00:01:35.240> into<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.600> hole<00:01:35.780> right<00:01:35.900> here<00:01:36.820> let's<00:01:37.820> set

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
here into the hole right here let's set

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.810 
here into the hole right here let's set
that<00:01:38.000> aside

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.890 

and<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> look<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> jet<00:01:46.620> mode<00:01:50.600> from<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
and take a look at the jet mode from the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.080 
and take a look at the jet mode from the
front<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.750> from<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> sides<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> rear

front and from the sides and the rear
and<00:02:00.200> top<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:03.300> then<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> undercarriage

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.430 

all<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.630> some<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.990> features<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> he

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
all right some of the features that he

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.820 
all right some of the features that he
has<00:02:10.560> while<00:02:10.800> he's<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.100> jet<00:02:11.280> mode<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:12.830> his

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
has while he's in jet mode is that his

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:24.890 
has while he's in jet mode is that his
cockpit<00:02:14.130> does<00:02:14.550> open<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
cockpit does open like that and you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.270 
cockpit does open like that and you
can't<00:02:25.170> open<00:02:25.440> his<00:02:25.590> nose<00:02:25.830> come<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:28.250> reveal<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
can't open his nose come to reveal a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.720 
can't open his nose come to reveal a
little<00:02:29.489> sensor<00:02:32.930> close<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.430> also

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
little sensor close that up and also

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.330 
little sensor close that up and also
it's<00:02:38.730> mainly<00:02:38.940> because<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:40.340> transformation

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's mainly because of transformation

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.699 
it's mainly because of transformation
but<00:02:41.550> he<00:02:42.150> does<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.989> lift<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.380> his<00:02:43.500> air

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
but he does you can lift up his air

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:51.380 
but he does you can lift up his air
brakes

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.840 

alright<00:02:52.340> does<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.660> landing<00:02:54.660> gear<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.130> these

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
alright does have landing gear and these

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.790 
alright does have landing gear and these
are<00:03:00.030> long<00:03:00.240> enough<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.600> have<00:03:00.810> clearance<00:03:01.709> so

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
are long enough to have clearance so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.590 
are long enough to have clearance so
that<00:03:01.950> nothing<00:03:02.220> drags<00:03:02.520> unlike<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.569> f4<00:03:03.959> phantom

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
that nothing drags unlike the f4 phantom

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.360 
that nothing drags unlike the f4 phantom
so<00:03:06.600> go<00:03:07.590> ahead<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.630> start<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> transformation

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
so go ahead and start the transformation

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
so go ahead and start the transformation
all<00:03:11.370> right<00:03:11.990> first<00:03:12.990> thing<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.260> do<00:03:13.410> is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
all right first thing we will do is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.920 
all right first thing we will do is
remove<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.480> missiles<00:03:15.870> kind<00:03:16.740> of<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:17.930> some

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
remove the missiles kind of like some

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.690 
remove the missiles kind of like some
kind<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.110> drone<00:03:19.380> missile<00:03:19.800> so<00:03:20.220> I'll<00:03:20.370> take<00:03:20.520> these

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
kind of drone missile so I'll take these

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.400 
kind of drone missile so I'll take these
