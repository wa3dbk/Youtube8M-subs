00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
aiming with that one so I took it off if

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.950 
aiming with that one so I took it off if
you're<00:01:07.899> thinking<00:01:08.079> that<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:10.390> will<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.659> really

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
you're thinking that it will be really

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.230 
you're thinking that it will be really
weird<00:01:11.259> having<00:01:11.649> one<00:01:11.950> time<00:01:12.189> higher<00:01:12.880> than<00:01:12.909> the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
weird having one time higher than the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.359 
weird having one time higher than the
other<00:01:13.560> trust<00:01:14.560> me<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.710> thought<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.130> same<00:01:15.340> thing

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
other trust me I thought the same thing

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.190 
other trust me I thought the same thing
and<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.390> forget<00:01:16.719> about<00:01:16.810> why<00:01:17.079> you're

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
and you you forget about why you're

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.730 
and you you forget about why you're
playing<00:01:17.490> um<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.659> yeah<00:01:20.020> um<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:22.180> raise<00:01:22.780> your

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
playing um so yeah um they raise your

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.590 
playing um so yeah um they raise your
thumb<00:01:24.070> up<00:01:24.100> pretty<00:01:24.729> high<00:01:25.950> um<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:28.060> probably

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
thumb up pretty high um that's probably

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.569 
thumb up pretty high um that's probably
what<00:01:28.719> feels<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.170> weirdest<00:01:29.649> when<00:01:29.859> you<00:01:29.979> first

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
what feels the weirdest when you first

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.260 
what feels the weirdest when you first
put<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.899> thumbstick<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:34.090> feel

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
put it on the thumbstick they feel

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.440 
put it on the thumbstick they feel
pretty<00:01:34.509> weird<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:35.380> first<00:01:35.619> couple<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.920> games

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
pretty weird the first couple of games

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.779 
pretty weird the first couple of games
my<00:01:37.450> first<00:01:37.719> game<00:01:37.929> with<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.109> mom<00:01:38.350> did<00:01:39.039> not<00:01:39.250> go<00:01:39.759> so

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
my first game with a mom did not go so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.529 
my first game with a mom did not go so
prettily<00:01:41.969> pretty<00:01:42.969> much<00:01:43.119> got<00:01:43.299> demolished

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
prettily pretty much got demolished

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.599 
prettily pretty much got demolished
because<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.960> was<00:01:44.079> still<00:01:44.890> trying<00:01:44.920> them<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:45.369> I

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
because I was still trying them on I

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.480 
because I was still trying them on I
play<00:01:45.909> usually<00:01:46.450> on<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.689> 9<00:01:47.439> sensitivity<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
play usually on a 9 sensitivity and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300 
play usually on a 9 sensitivity and
putting<00:01:49.479> these<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.840> actually<00:01:50.439> made<00:01:50.619> me<00:01:50.799> drop

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
putting these on actually made me drop

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.029 
putting these on actually made me drop
down<00:01:51.579> to<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.909> five<00:01:52.329> it's<00:01:53.140> kind<00:01:53.499> of<00:01:53.619> weird

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.709 

but<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.939> still<00:01:58.299> feels<00:01:58.569> like<00:01:58.749> a<00:01:59.200> 9<00:01:59.560> or<00:01:59.590> an<00:02:00.130> 8

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
but it still feels like a 9 or an 8

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.739 
but it still feels like a 9 or an 8
sensitivity<00:02:01.719> um<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:03.640> ultras<00:02:04.240> I'm<00:02:04.539> not<00:02:04.689> sure

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
sensitivity um these ultras I'm not sure

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.469 
sensitivity um these ultras I'm not sure
if<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:05.560> different<00:02:06.429> than<00:02:06.520> other<00:02:06.700> ones<00:02:06.909> but<00:02:07.060> I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
if it's different than other ones but I

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.090 
if it's different than other ones but I
don't<00:02:07.929> know<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> could<00:02:08.260> see<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.770> but

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
don't know if you could see that but
