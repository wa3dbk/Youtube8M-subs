00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.580 
all right I've had these 26 is on my
Tahoe<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> long<00:00:07.259> time<00:00:07.760> since<00:00:08.760> at<00:00:08.970> least

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
Tahoe for a long time since at least

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.299 
Tahoe for a long time since at least
2009<00:00:10.790> maybe<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.940> was<00:00:12.030> 2007<00:00:12.630> I'm<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.080> sure

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
2009 maybe it was 2007 I'm not sure

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.740 
2009 maybe it was 2007 I'm not sure
actually<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.759> was<00:00:14.820> 2007

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
actually I do think it was 2007

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.700 
actually I do think it was 2007
but<00:00:16.619> regardless<00:00:18.289> they're<00:00:19.289> still<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> good

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
but regardless they're still in good

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.080 
but regardless they're still in good
shape<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:22.039> just<00:00:23.039> want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> try<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> new<00:00:23.609> color<00:00:23.789> out

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
shape I just want to try a new color out

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.509 
shape I just want to try a new color out
I<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:25.350> always<00:00:25.500> thinking<00:00:25.740> black<00:00:26.160> would<00:00:26.369> look

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I was always thinking black would look

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.400 
I was always thinking black would look
good

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.810 

but<00:00:30.009> instead<00:00:30.509> when<00:00:31.509> I<00:00:31.630> try<00:00:31.840> this<00:00:31.900> out<00:00:32.820> will

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
but instead when I try this out will

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.479 
but instead when I try this out will
plastidip<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.540> inserts<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:36.309> to<00:00:36.399> leave

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
plastidip the inserts I want to leave

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.479 
plastidip the inserts I want to leave
the<00:00:36.610> dish<00:00:36.790> chrome<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.829> do<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.129> inserts

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
the dish chrome just do the inserts

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.240 
the dish chrome just do the inserts
alone<00:00:40.350> let's<00:00:41.350> see<00:00:41.500> how<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.739> looks

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
alone let's see how it looks

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.920 
alone let's see how it looks
the<00:00:42.489> good<00:00:42.670> thing<00:00:42.820> about<00:00:42.850> plastidip<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.720> that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
the good thing about plastidip is that

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.240 
the good thing about plastidip is that
it'll<00:00:44.140> come<00:00:44.290> right<00:00:44.320> off<00:00:44.500> if<00:00:44.829> you<00:00:44.920> don't<00:00:45.100> like

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
it'll come right off if you don't like

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.210 
it'll come right off if you don't like
it<00:00:45.460> peels<00:00:46.360> right<00:00:46.570> off<00:00:46.629> really<00:00:47.110> easy<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:48.070> more

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
it peels right off really easy the more

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.270 
it peels right off really easy the more
layers<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.820> better<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.470> scratch<00:00:50.980> proof

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
layers the better it's a scratch proof

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.200 
layers the better it's a scratch proof
not<00:00:52.089> scratch<00:00:52.390> proof<00:00:52.690> scratch<00:00:52.989> resistant<00:00:53.620> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
not scratch proof scratch resistant and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.299 
not scratch proof scratch resistant and
it<00:00:55.210> doesn't<00:00:55.479> peel<00:00:55.659> unless<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.949> want<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.250> to

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
it doesn't peel unless you want it to

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.460 
it doesn't peel unless you want it to
peel<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:58.149> we're<00:00:58.870> going<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.140> shoot<00:00:59.260> these

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
peel so we're going to shoot these

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.170 
peel so we're going to shoot these
inserts<00:00:59.860> to<00:01:00.010> see<00:01:00.159> if<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.339> looks<00:01:00.489> any<00:01:00.610> good<00:01:00.820> sure

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
inserts to see if it looks any good sure

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.340 
inserts to see if it looks any good sure
who<00:01:01.360> knows<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:01.600> might<00:01:01.839> have<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.080> shoot<00:01:02.229> that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350

who knows I might have to shoot that
grill<00:01:02.619> too<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:05.019> least<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.350> metal<00:01:05.619> part<00:01:05.830> maybe

leave the billet the way it is and do
that<00:01:08.170> inside<00:01:08.619> part<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.009> see<00:01:09.130> how<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.369> looks

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
that inside part to see how it looks

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.850 
that inside part to see how it looks
maybe<00:01:10.119> do<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.390> all<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.659> don't<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.290> gotta<00:01:11.770> say

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
maybe do it all I don't know I gotta say

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:34.350 
maybe do it all I don't know I gotta say
having<00:01:12.400> your<00:01:12.580> own<00:01:12.700> lift<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:14.049> much<00:01:14.229> rules

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.399 

we<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:37.240> switching<00:01:38.240> over<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.720> GoPro<00:01:38.899> camera

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
we go switching over to the GoPro camera

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.700 
we go switching over to the GoPro camera
I<00:01:41.409> think<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.649> looks<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.890> little<00:01:42.979> bit<00:01:43.189> better

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
I think it looks a little bit better

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:54.270 
I think it looks a little bit better
this<00:01:45.710> has<00:01:45.860> got<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:46.159> cool<00:01:46.340> fisheye

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
as you can see there's my little test

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.259 
as you can see there's my little test
run<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.390> yesterday<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:25.819> sprayed<00:02:26.209> a

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
run from yesterday I just sprayed a

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.580 
run from yesterday I just sprayed a
little<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.720> see<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:26.900> I'd<00:02:27.079> like<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.379> color

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
little on to see if I'd like the color

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.679 
little on to see if I'd like the color
and<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.010> did<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.909> now<00:02:29.030> we're<00:02:29.150> gonna<00:02:29.269> do<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.510> up

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
and I did so now we're gonna do this up

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.190 
and I did so now we're gonna do this up
properly<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.760> best<00:02:31.970> news<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.269> for<00:02:32.959> those<00:02:33.079> that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
properly the best news is for those that

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.960 
properly the best news is for those that
don't<00:02:33.409> know<00:02:33.500> his<00:02:33.890> plastic<00:02:34.280> dip<00:02:34.459> will<00:02:34.700> peel

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
don't know his plastic dip will peel

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.119 
don't know his plastic dip will peel
right<00:02:35.000> off<00:02:35.360> like<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.049> never<00:02:36.290> there<00:02:36.379> when

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
right off like it was never there when

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.130 
right off like it was never there when
it's<00:02:37.250> all<00:02:37.370> done<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:39.379> basically<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.989> not

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's all done so basically this is not

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500 
it's all done so basically this is not
permanent<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.579> can<00:02:43.760> be<00:02:43.909> if<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.329> it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
permanent but it can be if I like it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.259 
permanent but it can be if I like it
because<00:02:44.659> it's<00:02:44.900> scratch<00:02:45.230> resistant<00:02:45.859> and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
because it's scratch resistant and

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.460 
because it's scratch resistant and
doesn't<00:02:47.269> really<00:02:47.420> come<00:02:47.689> off<00:02:47.840> unless<00:02:48.049> you<00:02:48.109> want

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
doesn't really come off unless you want

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.240 
doesn't really come off unless you want
it<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.129> let's<00:02:50.000> see<00:02:50.150> how<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.540> looks<00:02:50.750> I

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it to so let's see how this looks I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.530 
it to so let's see how this looks I
see<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.459> chrome<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.819> gleaming<00:02:53.209> I'm<00:02:53.299> already

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
see that chrome is gleaming I'm already
