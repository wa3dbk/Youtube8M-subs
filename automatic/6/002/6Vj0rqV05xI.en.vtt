being<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> theatre<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.069> really<00:02:41.340> odd

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
being in a theatre it's a really odd

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.600 
being in a theatre it's a really odd
circumstance<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.660> very<00:02:42.900> small<00:02:43.319> space<00:02:43.610> so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
circumstance it's a very small space so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.509 
circumstance it's a very small space so
I<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> dispel<00:02:45.660> any<00:02:46.380> kind<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.160> don't

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
I think if you dispel any kind of don't

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.280 
I think if you dispel any kind of don't
be<00:02:47.640> self-conscious<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.569> all<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.870> kind<00:02:49.170> of
