I'm<00:00:01.230> Jason<00:00:01.560> with<00:00:01.920> tenkara<00:00:02.250> USA<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.000> today<00:00:03.179> I'm

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I'm Jason with tenkara USA and today I'm

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.670 
I'm Jason with tenkara USA and today I'm
going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> tie<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> very

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
going to show you how to tie a very

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
going to show you how to tie a very
simple<00:00:05.160> traditional<00:00:05.490> loop<00:00:06.000> by<00:00:06.180> Tsukasa

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
simple traditional loop by Tsukasa

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.530 
simple traditional loop by Tsukasa
kobbari<00:00:07.350> or<00:00:07.560> traditional<00:00:08.370> tenkara<00:00:08.700> fly<00:00:08.940> then

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
kobbari or traditional tenkara fly then

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.240 
kobbari or traditional tenkara fly then
at<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> end<00:00:09.780> we're<00:00:10.530> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> take<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> look<00:00:11.130> at

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
at the end we're going to take a look at

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.709 
at the end we're going to take a look at
some<00:00:11.370> slow-motion<00:00:11.910> video<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.330> what<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.570> looks

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
some slow-motion video of what it looks

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.850 
some slow-motion video of what it looks
like<00:00:12.840> underwater

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.170 

the<00:00:18.860> hook<00:00:18.980> I'll<00:00:19.100> be<00:00:19.220> using<00:00:19.340> for<00:00:19.520> this<00:00:19.760> fly<00:00:19.940> is<00:00:19.970> a

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
the hook I'll be using for this fly is a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.690 
the hook I'll be using for this fly is a
Gamakatsu<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:21.140> hook<00:00:21.470> it's<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.860> size<00:00:22.070> 7.5

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
Gamakatsu I you hook it's a size 7.5

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.970 
Gamakatsu I you hook it's a size 7.5
which<00:00:23.420> is<00:00:23.540> about<00:00:23.750> equivalent<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.350> number<00:00:24.710> 12

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
which is about equivalent to number 12

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.950 
which is about equivalent to number 12
in<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.250> western<00:00:25.610> hook<00:00:25.790> size<00:00:26.000> system<00:00:26.390> you

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
in the western hook size system you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.120 
in the western hook size system you
don't<00:00:27.050> have<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.320> use<00:00:27.440> this<00:00:27.590> hook<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:27.830> you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
don't have to use this hook and you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.440 
don't have to use this hook and you
certainly<00:00:28.340> don't<00:00:28.580> have<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.790> use<00:00:29.000> an<00:00:29.119> eyeless

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
certainly don't have to use an eyeless

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.150 
certainly don't have to use an eyeless
hook<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.200> could<00:00:30.320> use<00:00:30.350> any<00:00:30.950> hook

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
hook like this you could use any hook

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.220 
hook like this you could use any hook
you<00:00:31.279> want<00:00:31.430> but<00:00:31.730> that's<00:00:32.239> just<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.540> hook<00:00:32.720> I<00:00:32.900> like

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
you want but that's just the hook I like

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.869 
you want but that's just the hook I like
for<00:00:33.650> this<00:00:33.739> flight<00:00:33.950> because<00:00:34.190> it's<00:00:34.489> got<00:00:34.580> a<00:00:34.610> blue

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
for this flight because it's got a blue

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.729 
for this flight because it's got a blue
finish<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:35.690> think<00:00:35.780> works<00:00:36.500> really

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
finish to it that I think works really

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.280 
finish to it that I think works really
well<00:00:36.950> with<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.190> body<00:00:37.370> color<00:00:40.390> first<00:00:41.390> start

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
well with the body color first start

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.320 
well with the body color first start
your<00:00:42.440> thread<00:00:42.739> at<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.460> front<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.879> fly<00:00:44.059> and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
your thread at the front of the fly and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.600 
your thread at the front of the fly and
a<00:00:45.260> nihilist<00:00:45.650> hooks<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.070> this<00:00:46.309> there's

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
a nihilist hooks like this there's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.850 
a nihilist hooks like this there's
something<00:00:47.120> called<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.480> spade<00:00:47.870> which<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:48.650> kind

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
something called a spade which is kind

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.530 
something called a spade which is kind
of<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.980> little<00:00:49.220> flat<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.520> piece<00:00:49.970> right<00:00:50.300> at<00:00:50.450> the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
of a little flat and piece right at the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.000 
of a little flat and piece right at the
end<00:00:50.630> here<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:51.020> just<00:00:51.500> kind<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.680> leave<00:00:51.800> that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
end here I just kind of leave that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.930 
end here I just kind of leave that
exposed<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.850> make<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> few<00:00:54.250> base<00:00:55.250> wraps<00:00:55.640> of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
exposed and make a few base wraps of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.780 
exposed and make a few base wraps of
thread<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:58.040> when<00:00:58.160> I<00:00:58.190> attach<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.640> loop

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
thread so that when I attach the loop

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.410 
thread so that when I attach the loop
it's<00:00:59.120> gonna<00:00:59.300> grip<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.050> hook<00:01:00.200> nicely<00:01:01.239> now<00:01:02.239> it's

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's gonna grip the hook nicely now it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.420 
it's gonna grip the hook nicely now it's
time<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.690> add<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.170> loop<00:01:03.290> I<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:03.829> for<00:01:04.160> this<00:01:04.280> I'm

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
time to add the loop I and for this I'm

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.969 
time to add the loop I and for this I'm
using<00:01:04.460> silk<00:01:05.210> bead<00:01:05.449> cord<00:01:05.810> size<00:01:06.259> number<00:01:06.740> two

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
using silk bead cord size number two

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.010 
using silk bead cord size number two
that's<00:01:07.670> about<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:08.090> diameter<00:01:08.690> for

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
that's about the right diameter for

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.960 
that's about the right diameter for
flies<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:10.190> comes<00:01:10.399> in<00:01:10.580> thicker<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
flies like this it comes in thicker and

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.030 
flies like this it comes in thicker and
thinner<00:01:11.149> diameters<00:01:11.630> but<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:11.869> really<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
thinner diameters but I really like the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.460 
thinner diameters but I really like the
number<00:01:13.490> two<00:01:13.670> size<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.720> I'm<00:01:14.780> just<00:01:14.869> gonna<00:01:14.960> pinch

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
number two size and I'm just gonna pinch

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.790 
number two size and I'm just gonna pinch
a<00:01:15.590> little<00:01:15.680> loop<00:01:15.950> of<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:17.530> start<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.649> right

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
a little loop of that and start it right

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.630 
a little loop of that and start it right
the<00:01:18.920> front<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.430> hook<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:21.399> tightly<00:01:22.399> wrap

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
the front of the hook and tightly wrap

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.940 
the front of the hook and tightly wrap
back<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.869> don't<00:01:27.020> have<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.319> wrap<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.500> lot<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.860> it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
back you don't have to wrap a lot of it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.279 
back you don't have to wrap a lot of it
on<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.130> hook<00:01:28.250> shank<00:01:28.429> it's<00:01:28.729> pretty<00:01:29.060> strong<00:01:29.390> so

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
on the hook shank it's pretty strong so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.109 
on the hook shank it's pretty strong so
I<00:01:30.560> only<00:01:30.740> go<00:01:31.179> about<00:01:32.179> midway<00:01:32.929> or<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.819> believe

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
I only go about midway or so and believe

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.910 
I only go about midway or so and believe
it<00:01:35.179> or<00:01:35.209> not<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:35.600> actually<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.080> very<00:01:36.229> strong

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
it or not that's actually a very strong

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.440 
it or not that's actually a very strong
loop<00:01:37.160> strong<00:01:37.429> enough<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.700> hold<00:01:37.789> a<00:01:37.910> fish<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.330> if

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
loop strong enough to hold a fish now if

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.870 
loop strong enough to hold a fish now if
you<00:01:38.539> want<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.229> can<00:01:39.410> put<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.590> little<00:01:39.740> glue<00:01:40.550> here

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
you want you can put a little glue here

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.639 
you want you can put a little glue here
or<00:01:41.060> head<00:01:41.209> cement<00:01:41.569> but<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.810> normally<00:01:42.350> don't<00:01:42.470> do

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
or head cement but I normally don't do

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.219 
or head cement but I normally don't do
that<00:01:43.149> now<00:01:44.149> it's<00:01:44.300> time<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.539> tell<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.929> hackle

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
that now it's time to tell you to hackle

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.589 
that now it's time to tell you to hackle
and<00:01:45.530> for<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.860> I'm<00:01:46.069> using<00:01:46.130> Brahma<00:01:46.819> hen<00:01:47.209> hackle

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.830 

now<00:02:13.750> I'll<00:02:13.870> take<00:02:13.990> my<00:02:14.050> hackle<00:02:14.590> pliers<00:02:15.750> put<00:02:16.750> the

now I'll take my hackle pliers put the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.309 
now I'll take my hackle pliers put the
hackle<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.380> there<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:19.239> make<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> few<00:02:20.110> wraps

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
hackle in there and make a few wraps

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.490 
hackle in there and make a few wraps
going<00:02:21.069> back<00:02:21.250> toward<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> bend<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.150> hook

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
going back toward the bend of the hook

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.600 
going back toward the bend of the hook
now<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> hackle<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:23.980> gonna<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> tendency

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
now the hackle is gonna have a tendency

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.190 
now the hackle is gonna have a tendency
to<00:02:25.000> want<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.180> fight<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> little<00:02:25.810> bit<00:02:25.959> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
to want to fight you a little bit and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.320 
to want to fight you a little bit and
it's<00:02:26.530> gonna<00:02:26.709> want<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.910> kind<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.090> go<00:02:28.180> all<00:02:28.300> over

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
it's gonna want to kind of go all over

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.790 
it's gonna want to kind of go all over
the<00:02:28.540> place<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.959> what<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.560> kind<00:02:29.709> of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
the place so what you can do is kind of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.470 
the place so what you can do is kind of
just<00:02:29.860> sweep<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.340> forward<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.000> wrap<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
just sweep it forward as you wrap and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.090 
just sweep it forward as you wrap and
that<00:02:31.900> will<00:02:31.989> help<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> fibers<00:02:32.770> point

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
that will help all the fibers point

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:50.059 
that will help all the fibers point
forward<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.530> tie<00:02:47.739> off<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.100> stem<00:02:48.340> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
forward and just tie off the stem and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.300 
forward and just tie off the stem and
cut<00:02:51.069> off<00:02:51.190> any<00:02:51.489> stray<00:02:52.150> barbs<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:57.040> I'll<00:02:57.160> make

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
cut off any stray barbs now I'll make

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.150 
cut off any stray barbs now I'll make
the<00:02:57.580> dubbing<00:02:58.269> body<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.019> I'm<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.350> using<00:02:59.560> all

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the dubbing body and I'm just using all

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.090 
the dubbing body and I'm just using all
of<00:03:00.519> synthetic<00:03:00.790> dubbing<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.890> could<00:03:02.890> use

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
of synthetic dubbing for this could use

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.830 
of synthetic dubbing for this could use
fur<00:03:03.459> or<00:03:03.790> whatever<00:03:04.299> kind<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.510> dubbing<00:03:04.750> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
fur or whatever kind of dubbing you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 
fur or whatever kind of dubbing you
prefer<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:05.950> cuz<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.280> got<00:03:06.370> a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
prefer but I like this cuz it's got a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.420 
prefer but I like this cuz it's got a
little<00:03:06.610> bit<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.880> sparkle<00:03:07.569> in<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.280> Jack's<00:03:09.280> is

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
little bit of a sparkle in it Jack's is

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.400 
little bit of a sparkle in it Jack's is
a<00:03:09.459> nice<00:03:09.670> attractor<00:03:10.150> pattern<00:03:10.480> now<00:03:11.019> one<00:03:11.230> thing

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
a nice attractor pattern now one thing

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.530 
a nice attractor pattern now one thing
about<00:03:11.500> dubbing<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.880> always<00:03:13.209> better<00:03:13.390> to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
about dubbing is it's always better to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.720 
about dubbing is it's always better to
put<00:03:13.900> less<00:03:14.590> than<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.890> think<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.220> need<00:03:15.250> on<00:03:15.489> and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
put less than you think you need on and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.580 
put less than you think you need on and
add<00:03:15.819> more<00:03:16.060> later<00:03:16.329> if<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.959> put<00:03:17.140> too<00:03:17.260> much<00:03:17.380> on

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
add more later if you put too much on

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.170 
add more later if you put too much on
it's<00:03:17.799> kind<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.100> hard<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.340> get<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.549> off<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.970> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
it's kind of hard to get it off so I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.410 
it's kind of hard to get it off so I
like<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.810> estimate<00:03:20.650> how<00:03:21.549> much<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.910> think<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.209> need

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
like to estimate how much I think I need

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
like to estimate how much I think I need
and<00:03:22.660> then<00:03:23.170> put<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> little<00:03:23.829> bit<00:03:23.920> less<00:03:24.100> than

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and then put on a little bit less than

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.310 
and then put on a little bit less than
that<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.730> I'm<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.450> gonna<00:03:25.600> start<00:03:25.900> forming<00:03:26.230> a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
that so I'm just gonna start forming a

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.140 
that so I'm just gonna start forming a
nice<00:03:26.470> tapered<00:03:26.920> body<00:03:27.130> here<00:03:27.459> that's<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> little

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
nice tapered body here that's a little

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.750 
nice tapered body here that's a little
bit<00:03:28.269> thick<00:03:28.570> at<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.680> thorax<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.310> fly<00:03:30.489> and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
bit thick at the thorax of the fly and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:50.690 
bit thick at the thorax of the fly and
then<00:03:31.030> taper<00:03:31.299> down<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.769> back

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.820 

once<00:03:51.030> you've<00:03:51.180> got<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> taper<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.620> can

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
once you've got a taper you like you can

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.000 
once you've got a taper you like you can
take<00:03:53.190> your<00:03:53.280> whip<00:03:53.459> finisher<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.739> make<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
take your whip finisher and just make a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.229 
take your whip finisher and just make a
few<00:03:56.220> wraps<00:03:56.370> right<00:03:56.880> at<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.090> back<00:03:57.239> of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.480> fly

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
few wraps right at the back of the fly

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.729 
few wraps right at the back of the fly
normally<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.810> tie<00:04:00.989> my<00:04:01.260> flies<00:04:01.500> off

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
normally I like to tie my flies off

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.260 
normally I like to tie my flies off
right<00:04:01.950> behind<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.280> hackle<00:04:02.610> but<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> dubbed

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
right behind the hackle but on a dubbed

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.360 
right behind the hackle but on a dubbed
body<00:04:03.510> fly<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.560> doesn't<00:04:05.250> look

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.760 
right here I prefer the way it looks
when<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.970> tied<00:04:09.120> off<00:04:09.270> at<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.450> back<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.930> just

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
when it's tied off at the back and just

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.490 
when it's tied off at the back and just
go<00:04:10.920> ahead<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.520> cut<00:04:12.030> off<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.180> thread<00:04:12.500> these

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
go ahead and cut off the thread these

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.320 
go ahead and cut off the thread these
flies<00:04:13.800> have<00:04:13.980> been<00:04:14.010> very<00:04:14.340> effective<00:04:14.580> for<00:04:14.790> me<00:04:14.970> so

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
flies have been very effective for me so

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.580 
flies have been very effective for me so
why<00:04:15.510> don't<00:04:15.630> we<00:04:15.660> take<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> look<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.350> see<00:04:16.380> what

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
why don't we take a look in and see what

00:04:16.590 --> 00:05:44.970 
why don't we take a look in and see what
they<00:04:16.680> look<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:16.829> underwater

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.040
