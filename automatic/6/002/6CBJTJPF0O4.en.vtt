00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
approximately almost 900 grafts from the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
approximately almost 900 grafts from the
artist<00:00:32.579> system<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> holes<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.510> small<00:00:33.840> they

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
artist system the holes are small they

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.760 
artist system the holes are small they
look<00:00:34.530> comparable<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.210> fue<00:00:36.840> sites<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.680> i

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
look comparable to the fue sites that i

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.220 
look comparable to the fue sites that i
use<00:00:38.010> before<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> point<00:00:39.300> nine<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
use before which is a point nine but in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.670 
use before which is a point nine but in
actuality<00:00:40.590> they're<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.399> 1.2<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.020> once

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
actuality they're about a 1.2 but once

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
actuality they're about a 1.2 but once
it<00:00:43.890> heals<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.520> looks<00:00:44.700> pretty<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.090> turn

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it heals it looks pretty good turn

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
it heals it looks pretty good turn

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
with this artist the robot system I am

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.039 
with this artist the robot system I am
totally<00:01:26.850> convinced<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.840> hundred

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
before to see the machine but once I got

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
before to see the machine but once I got
it<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.740> didn't<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.030> then

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
we showed him all the graphs what really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
we showed him all the graphs what really
counts<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.240> doesn't<00:01:45.570> matter<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.960> system<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
counts it doesn't matter what system you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
counts it doesn't matter what system you
use<00:01:46.680> whether<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.399> by<00:01:47.610> hand<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.299> with

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
use whether you do it by hand or with

use whether you do it by hand or with
the<00:01:48.899> artists<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> graphs<00:01:50.369> look

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the artists are that the graphs look

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
the artists are that the graphs look
good<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> plant<00:01:52.200> bad<00:01:52.500> graphs

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
good because if you plant bad graphs

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
good because if you plant bad graphs
what<00:01:53.369> happens<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.479> grow<00:01:54.720> these

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
what happens it will not grow these

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.859 
what happens it will not grow these
graphs<00:01:55.619> were<00:01:56.009> beautiful<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.630> as

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
graphs were beautiful just as good as

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.600 
graphs were beautiful just as good as
the<00:01:57.960> grass<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.040> use<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> safe

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the grass that I get when I use the safe

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.170 
the grass that I get when I use the safe
system<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.899> say<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.860> far<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.610> thumbs<00:02:02.969> up

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
system so I say so far some thumbs up

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330 
system so I say so far some thumbs up
with<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> artist<00:02:03.719> system<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.920> proofs<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.250> the
