think<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:46.960> school<00:01:47.200> actually<00:01:47.440> really

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
think that this school actually really

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.740 
think that this school actually really
how<00:01:47.980> high<00:01:48.190> school<00:01:48.490> but<00:01:48.730> now<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.390> look<00:01:49.570> at

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
how high school but now that I look at

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.810 
how high school but now that I look at
it<00:01:49.900> you<00:01:50.140> could<00:01:50.530> probably<00:01:50.710> manage<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.520> even

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
it you could probably manage to get even

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.130 
it you could probably manage to get even
though<00:01:51.910> they<00:01:52.060> say<00:01:52.210> it's<00:01:52.390> high<00:01:52.450> price<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.930> can

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
though they say it's high price you can

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.080 
though they say it's high price you can
still<00:01:53.290> manage<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.590> probably<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.550> lot

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090
