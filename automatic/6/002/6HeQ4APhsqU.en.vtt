00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
you a set and say it works I'm gonna

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
you a set and say it works I'm gonna
show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> proofs<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.469> before<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
show you proofs but before any of that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.770 
show you proofs but before any of that
here's<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:49.289> works<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.460> first<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.629> we

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
here's how the set works so first off we

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
here's how the set works so first off we
are<00:00:51.840> gonna<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.140> using<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.559> adamant<00:00:52.980> nature<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
are gonna be using an adamant nature to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
are gonna be using an adamant nature to
give<00:00:53.760> Kabutops<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.960> highest<00:00:55.440> Attack<00:00:55.770> stat

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
give Kabutops the highest Attack stat

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.119 
give Kabutops the highest Attack stat
possible<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> ability<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
possible and the ability is going to be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
possible and the ability is going to be
weak<00:00:59.399> armor<00:00:59.940> which<00:01:00.510> essentially<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.440> gives

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
weak armor which essentially just gives

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.670 
weak armor which essentially just gives
you<00:01:02.039> when<00:01:02.280> hit<00:01:02.460> by<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.730> attack<00:01:03.140> -<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.320> defense

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you when hit by an attack - one defense

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
you when hit by an attack - one defense
and<00:01:04.949> plus<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.519> speed<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.360> leave<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> little

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and plus one speed I will leave a little

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.560 
and plus one speed I will leave a little
bit<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.500> information<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> ability<00:01:09.180> in
