00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
can just try and make it work because

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320 
can just try and make it work because
you<00:04:31.500> don't<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:31.800> room<00:04:31.950> but<00:04:32.639> I'm<00:04:32.849> gonna<00:04:33.060> make

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
you don't have room but I'm gonna make

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.070 
you don't have room but I'm gonna make
them<00:04:33.510> smaller<00:04:33.960> as<00:04:34.320> they<00:04:34.560> come<00:04:34.800> down<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:36.080> his

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
them smaller as they come down to his

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.580 
them smaller as they come down to his
neck<00:04:37.849> maybe<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.150> top<00:04:39.419> could<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:40.229> small

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
neck maybe the top could be the small

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.150 
neck maybe the top could be the small
one

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
one

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.580 
one
down<00:04:41.460> could<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:41.850> big<00:04:42.180> one<00:04:42.420> yeah<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.290> could<00:04:43.470> do

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
down could be big one yeah you could do

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.210 
down could be big one yeah you could do
it<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.770> opposite<00:04:47.810> see<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.230> then<00:04:49.920> I'm

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
it the opposite see that and then I'm

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.790 
it the opposite see that and then I'm
going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.520> draw<00:04:50.820> do<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.750> same<00:04:52.080> thing<00:04:52.380> down<00:04:52.680> the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
going to draw do the same thing down the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.220 
going to draw do the same thing down the
other<00:04:52.980> side<00:04:55.280> get<00:04:56.280> smaller<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:56.970> they<00:04:57.540> get

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
other side get smaller as they get

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:07.730 
other side get smaller as they get
closer<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.890> his<00:04:59.010> tail

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740

good just draw a point in a curved line
and<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:26.280> point<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.730> a<00:05:26.790> curved<00:05:27.000> line

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
and a point in a curved line

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:34.179 
and a point in a curved line
good<00:05:30.619> you<00:05:31.619> got<00:05:31.860> sound<00:05:32.129> effects<00:05:32.489> going<00:05:33.139> can't

do a couple down this bag yeah good job
checkers<00:05:46.199> that's<00:05:46.559> awesome<00:05:47.039> you<00:05:47.519> did<00:05:47.789> it<00:05:47.969> so

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
checkers that's awesome you did it so

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.199 
checkers that's awesome you did it so
we've<00:05:49.199> got<00:05:49.379> one<00:05:49.619> last<00:05:49.769> step<00:05:50.099> we<00:05:50.610> forgot<00:05:50.969> one

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:51.209 
we've got one last step we forgot one

Stegosaurus has cool spikes and I think

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.799 
Stegosaurus has cool spikes and I think
they<00:05:58.649> thought<00:05:59.580> that<00:05:59.639> these<00:05:59.999> were<00:06:00.239> used<00:06:00.509> for

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:00.809 
they thought that these were used for

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.699 
they thought that these were used for

practice you can watch the video over a

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.409 
practice you can watch the video over a
couple<00:06:52.169> times<00:06:52.289> and<00:06:53.039> practice<00:06:53.939> it<00:06:54.119> you'll<00:06:54.300> get

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
couple times and practice it you'll get

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.979 
couple times and practice it you'll get
better<00:06:54.659> is<00:06:55.349> that<00:06:55.439> fun<00:06:56.059> pretty<00:06:57.059> easy<00:06:57.329> huh

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:57.989 
better is that fun pretty easy huh
