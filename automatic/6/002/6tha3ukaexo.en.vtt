00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 all right 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.350
 plus 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.680
 hello welcome to all 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.340
 Today I present a guide 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.040
 with a trick and commanded to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.260
 survive 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.540
 to make some good rounds you have 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.230
 what to put between this corner is 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.520
 corner that is here this and the other that 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.560
 there is for zombies to come to us 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.240
 here it is worth the one that is here in this in 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.350
 this site so that they do not come 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.550
 zombies and have to put in the other 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.620
 corner and in this it's worth between this 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.180
 corner and the other for the zombies 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.890
 do not come to you from time to time in a 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.660
 pretty high round can come to you from 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 some of others that escapes that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.059
 always usually happens and well the normal 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.809
 and good here I present the trick itself 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.689
 How is it 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.479
 and well now I will go up and teach you 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.810
 how do I see you there I miss a 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.810
 zombie 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.590
 and well there I have a lot of lame 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 to get on 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.969
 if you want I leave the link how 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.329
 do this straight trick but I do a 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.329
 receiver 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.259
 well now I will upload what happens that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.259
 now failure is the bad thing 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.610
 It's typical 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 you put here more or less in the middle of the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 radio 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 already blade but like the zombie was 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.170
 of trash up because it has not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.530
 come out has to be more or less where 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.210
 is now more or less down 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.000
 your partner has to entertain you 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.590
 there underneath while you go 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.360
 placing on the site that looks more or 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.380
 minus half radio in the bar is there 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.899
 perfectly you see it there 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.410
 slashed the zombie and you'll be in 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.630
 the site you put here where is the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.880
 wheel is now I point it there 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 just pointing pointing there 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 also and the zombies for 7 will be there 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840
 in that site 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.500
 and good and it is already here is made the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.210
 trick 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.300
