00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.940
 more short means more action 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.800
 seemed above their hands again 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.689
 I also try out way case already 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 that 2 is 2 and I who still two out of three 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.770

 I'll just give the sand and that's how you make it 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.210
 so the three two in the 90th minute what 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.680
 quite nice it feels pretty good 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.750

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.670

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.049
 then he just scores the 31st way 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.390

 lately i know this 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.230
 just apparently normal in fifa 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.489
 but well we just go on because 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.230
 of course I will not give up I will 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.090
 try to go through a cup almost the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.920
 one inside but perfect 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.659
 great rescue against the head of mocros 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.610
 then I'm gonna take the cords with you 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.680
 The same gifts that puts him on Thomas 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.209
 bumps and in two attempts was 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.409
 to head in and that's how he makes it 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.170
 a one of 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.819
 in the 38th minute you can say mine 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.459
 pretty bad and I would 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.160
 agree because no it is t is one 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.230
 lie it's just i have occasionally 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.849
 quite lucky that may be said 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.769
 and here comes normally through what 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.940
 He is very lucky because I am busy 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.489
 nothing at all here 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.569
 nothing happens at all and he does the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.970
 arrow team and you see it here 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.530
 repetitions 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.079
 watch what the fuck where does this save 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.390
 literally, what does that mean? 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.400
 no idea point search fuckin our 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.829
 that he will receive a penalty for that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 ie book number is batterie 696 arrow 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.530
 that save the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.629
 then you think the one you should wonder then 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.340
 taking from the elite takes it with sec 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.540
 and honor for kk 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.220
 who really has no better penalties 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.079
 to ballot but good and he takes it 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.489
 scores him and she stands for two years 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.049
 for and David's son yes a bit 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.370
 this competition is ready 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.319
 it was a pretty exciting competition 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.220
 bridge we both didn't create 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.660
 very much 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.950
 and you could both defend very well 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.340
 also Merkel Mats Hummels or through the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 match 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.220
 but then you know what time 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.269
 it 's how well played out how i do 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.590
 played 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.359
 just leave that very nice and nice that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.010
 a penalty may fair play for heavy duty 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.450
 with a victory address we like 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.099
 I hear I have two games one 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.540
 I have to win that in this pot 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.549
 at least that would be a fact to us 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.799
 To make it a game play a must 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.180
 winning that never goes really well so me 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.340
 I just have to try picking now 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.630
 and Ingrid seemed a bit of a your time 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.669
 nice as long as almost nothing no but I have to 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.760
 are the club the city or is there an oath 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.459
 and skin and the best online steam in van 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.120
 peppa dali ovens that cost maria deco 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.000
 there benzema modric peak marcel everywhere 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.530
 just a very very good team we go 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120
 just because he didn't really play very well 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.040
 well that was here with jans i got the ball 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 give my crooked screen back over the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.730
 top his defense is huge I have 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.799
 here is a jansen who is left legged 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.739
 then I can shoot a cross and everything 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.329
 so I score the 101 tenth we come this 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.880
 I am ahead which is pretty good 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.820
 of course because dancing like that is fair 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.830
 0 scores in the 10th minute that is possible 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.659
 become a fun competition and you certainly will 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.040
 sees how hard peaks falls he hit 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.660
 nuts are you still on 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 and where worrying welded back I want 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.050
 u we don't like you always makes too 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.640
 many errors also in real life is in itself 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.290
 quite realistic from fifa 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.910
 but as soon as I am here 200 for two 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.740
 I'm talking too because I score you 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.330
 just perform put me score with 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.970
 I believe Mario Gomez is 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.300
 yes number 13 mario gomez and if you stand 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.340
 so 200 in the 31st minute and I want 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.810
 by the way, some more questions 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.800
 again sorry for the ending off i do 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.450
 I just really have a cold I can 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.130
 do little about it but want you 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.480
 another kind of round through soon 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.620
 my club at least see that i'm just the 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.900
 show teams that I have at that time 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.340
 use I know my battle remains 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.290
 have or you like to see 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.580
 but it seems pretty funny 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.600
 sympathy but I well where my things 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.220
 I am trying to compete more 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.730
 but here they are not complete 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.170
 look out 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.400
 church or at least i sat that i was looking at 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.800
 medium purple too but I didn't realize 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.060
 that they walk that they striker that walking action 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.700
 and they score during the kick-off ' 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.140
 cunning in May and so there is two one 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.210
 but then i come here again at 3y 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.400
 because i really get a clearing 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.470
 own goal if you watch 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.350
 against him I go full logus light 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.500
 and your bon runs the goal of through his back 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.880
 yes guys hey africa has enough 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.590
 eat sit does not have to borrow anything 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.480

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.620
 a pretty good couple of hi-res week 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.990

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.730
 you could not see that is chose cassy's 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.460
 when hate will already but I come here too 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.530
 another 4 tm chula never misses in a one op 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.810

 a little pussy defend heats it 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.300
 end I had to be very careful 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.770
 but I actually want it with times 3 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.590
