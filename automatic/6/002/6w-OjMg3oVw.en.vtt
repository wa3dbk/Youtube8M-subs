thing but we were conscious about was
dct<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:41.020> spike<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.530> know<00:04:41.650> because<00:04:41.979> the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
dct in the spike you know because the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.680 
dct in the spike you know because the
fact<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.520> was<00:04:42.669> going<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:42.940> be<00:04:43.030> written<00:04:43.210> off<00:04:43.419> road

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
fact it was going to be written off road

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.940 
fact it was going to be written off road
and<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:44.169> know<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:44.919> was<00:04:45.250> very<00:04:45.870> nervous<00:04:46.870> about<00:04:47.289> how

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
and I know I was very nervous about how

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.909 
and I know I was very nervous about how
it<00:04:48.010> was<00:04:48.250> going<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.550> work<00:04:49.289> again<00:04:50.289> after<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
it was going to work again after the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.210 
it was going to work again after the
test<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.520> dct<00:04:52.150> is<00:04:52.479> incredible<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.800> be<00:04:53.919> honest

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
test that dct is incredible to be honest

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.409 
test that dct is incredible to be honest
that<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.490> do<00:04:54.550> not<00:04:54.760> love<00:04:55.000> dct<00:04:55.770> maybe<00:04:56.770> because<00:04:57.160> I'm

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
that I do not love dct maybe because I'm

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.210 
that I do not love dct maybe because I'm
getting<00:04:58.419> old<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.990> do<00:04:59.050> prefer<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.770> ship<00:05:00.010> by

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
getting old and I do prefer to ship by

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.250 
getting old and I do prefer to ship by
myself<00:05:00.720> but<00:05:01.720> for<00:05:02.610> first<00:05:03.610> time<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.210> felt<00:05:04.990> that

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
myself but for first time I felt that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
myself but for first time I felt that
dct<00:05:05.710> now<00:05:06.220> is<00:05:06.550> better<00:05:06.789> than<00:05:06.940> me<00:05:07.240> these<00:05:08.050> are<00:05:08.320> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
dct now is better than me these are the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.370 
dct now is better than me these are the
new<00:05:09.580> settings<00:05:09.850> of<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.180> TCT<00:05:10.750> they<00:05:11.260> are

new settings of the TCT they are

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.010 
new settings of the TCT they are
fantastic<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.070> not<00:05:12.280> only<00:05:12.430> for<00:05:12.760> on-road<00:05:13.690> you

I've been developing all the products
that<00:05:58.500> yesterday<00:05:59.500> was<00:05:59.710> probably<00:06:00.130> one<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.370> the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
that yesterday was probably one of the

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.170 
that yesterday was probably one of the
best<00:06:00.700> experiences<00:06:00.940> from<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:02.020> riding<00:06:03.180> enjoyment

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
best experiences from a riding enjoyment

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.140 
best experiences from a riding enjoyment
in<00:06:04.330> perspective<00:06:04.960> of<00:06:05.110> hadn't<00:06:05.770> yeah<00:06:06.280> in<00:06:06.730> all<00:06:06.880> the

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
in perspective of hadn't yeah in all the

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.950 
in perspective of hadn't yeah in all the
years<00:06:07.390> of<00:06:07.960> India's<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:08.830> think<00:06:09.160> something<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.840> be

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
years of India's I think something to be

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.750 
years of India's I think something to be
considered<00:06:11.320> is<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.860> when<00:06:12.070> we<00:06:12.250> launched<00:06:12.550> the

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
considered is that when we launched the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.700 
considered is that when we launched the
first<00:06:13.000> Africa<00:06:13.420> tweener<00:06:13.630> that<00:06:13.900> name<00:06:14.080> we<00:06:14.260> had<00:06:14.500> no

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
first Africa tweener that name we had no

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.670 
first Africa tweener that name we had no
competitors<00:06:15.280> yeah<00:06:15.790> and<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.420> bike<00:06:16.600> was<00:06:16.840> a<00:06:16.900> okay

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
competitors yeah and the bike was a okay

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.620 
competitors yeah and the bike was a okay
we<00:06:17.890> start<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.400> legend<00:06:18.730> right<00:06:19.480> at<00:06:20.200> that<00:06:20.350> moment

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
we start a legend right at that moment

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.170 
we start a legend right at that moment
now<00:06:22.630> many<00:06:23.170> years<00:06:23.290> later<00:06:23.910> there<00:06:24.910> are<00:06:25.000> many

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
now many years later there are many

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.270 
now many years later there are many
competitors<00:06:25.810> healed<00:06:26.080> but<00:06:26.380> even<00:06:26.680> so<00:06:26.890> I<00:06:26.920> do<00:06:27.160> feel

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
competitors healed but even so I do feel

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.080 
competitors healed but even so I do feel
that<00:06:27.550> our<00:06:27.790> back<00:06:28.180> is<00:06:28.780> still<00:06:29.320> ready<00:06:30.070> to<00:06:30.160> start<00:06:30.940> a
