00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
really have that that you know lends

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.449 
really have that that you know lends
itself<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.989> ninja<00:03:18.410> type<00:03:18.620> gameplay<00:03:19.130> even

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
itself to a ninja type gameplay even

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.830

a<00:03:20.930> lot<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.230> has<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.829> perk

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
a lot of it has to do with the perk

warfare<00:03:27.500> 3<00:03:27.739> didn't<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.489> Blackbird<00:03:28.940> but

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
warfare 3 didn't have the Blackbird but

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.229 
warfare 3 didn't have the Blackbird but
it<00:03:29.690> also<00:03:29.870> gave<00:03:30.230> away<00:03:30.530> free<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:31.040> abs<00:03:31.489> which<00:03:31.940> you

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
it also gave away free you abs which you

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.470 
it also gave away free you abs which you
know<00:03:32.360> isn't<00:03:32.600> as<00:03:32.900> bad<00:03:33.110> but<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:34.610> know<00:03:34.730> free<00:03:35.000> UAVs

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480

obviously you can use assassin and such
like<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.709> then<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.670> map<00:03:40.880> design<00:03:41.120> I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
like that but then it's the map design I

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.970 
like that but then it's the map design I
feel<00:03:41.690> like<00:03:41.780> modern<00:03:42.110> warfare<00:03:42.230> 2<00:03:42.470> was<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.739> last
