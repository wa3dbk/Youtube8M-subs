misto<00:00:49.389> bottles<00:00:49.780> I'm<00:00:49.989> using<00:00:50.229> in<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.589> video

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
misto bottles I'm using in this video

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000 
misto bottles I'm using in this video
now<00:00:51.639> as<00:00:51.909> far<00:00:52.179> as<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.569> oil<00:00:52.600> mixture<00:00:53.049> goes<00:00:53.559> this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
now as far as the oil mixture goes this

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.090 
now as far as the oil mixture goes this
one<00:00:54.249> is<00:00:54.370> more<00:00:55.179> beneficial<00:00:55.479> for<00:00:56.229> colder

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
one is more beneficial for colder

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
one is more beneficial for colder
weather<00:00:57.309> because<00:00:57.639> I'm<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:57.940> use<00:00:58.089> a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
weather because I'm going to use a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.739 
weather because I'm going to use a
heavier<00:00:58.870> oil<00:00:59.139> which<00:00:59.440> will<00:00:59.709> be<00:00:59.979> better<00:01:00.159> for<00:01:00.519> a

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
heavier oil which will be better for a

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.380 
heavier oil which will be better for a
ceiling<00:01:01.749> in<00:01:01.929> your<00:01:02.199> moisture<00:01:02.859> so<00:01:03.519> I'm<00:01:03.940> going<00:01:04.360> to

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
ceiling in your moisture so I'm going to

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.310 
ceiling in your moisture so I'm going to
go<00:01:04.659> with<00:01:04.899> either<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:06.100> castor<00:01:06.700> oil<00:01:06.780> olive<00:01:07.780> oil<00:01:07.810> or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
go with either a castor oil olive oil or

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.859 
go with either a castor oil olive oil or
avocado<00:01:08.680> oil<00:01:09.310> those<00:01:09.789> will<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.149> your<00:01:10.420> heavier

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
avocado oil those will be your heavier

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.679 
avocado oil those will be your heavier
oils<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.439> then<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:11.829> mix<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.640> lighter<00:01:13.360> oil

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689
