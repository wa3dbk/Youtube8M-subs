00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.939
 this is very dark I thought it was going 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.939
 something that is that 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.630
 what 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:28.030
 and that seems like a wastebasket 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.810
 my mother I will go out and you cojones 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.150
 what is done 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.260
 is that 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.260
 and if over 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
 and that study 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.490
 I'm watching 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 wow 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 all these 20 years and frames commenting 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.170
 could not guys today is tribune relives a 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.049
 mod as you are seeing is a very mode 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 weird is called john moody as you have 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.590
 seen right now what I finish 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.180
 teaching is a had done it a bit like that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.799
 like this movie style though as 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.899
 This is a forest and it is full of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.899
 clippers and all that and besides that is 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.369
 no pisco in Pizzurno out because I have been 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.890
 come out a little weird but hey what else 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.890
 this is a weird way that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.539
 found on the internet and the truth is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.119
 who have nothing but a craft that 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.460
 exists when we kill the caller 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 jones this one is called be be yon 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 that is the normal little me then it's 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.340
 the giant that is the one who teaches or taught 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 to the little ones and when we kill 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.179
 will give two gems of these good can we 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.710
 give one or two or three and with this we 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.110
 we can make a sword of these that is 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 a good an immortal sword that the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.619
 truth is that it is very good serves to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.090
 kill enemies and to them basically and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.500
 I'm going to teach the enemies a little more 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.450
 because you have not appreciated them anyway 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.009
 Well the truth is that I do not know how to last 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.750
 the video but it's a pretty short video 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.970
 since good is a pretty funny way 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.470
 I do not know if then upload another video like 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.980
 I start the new modern warfare series 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.140
 3 of the road to walk but well I do not know 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.810
 well we have arispÃ³n baby I'm going to go down 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.290
 the sound because if it's not going to go much 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 work a little bit often I'm going to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.720
 put easy as you see monetti forest 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.850
 where it's enough to be good roadrunner 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.560
 here here as you see is a kind of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.840
 monster is called be be yon this is the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.270
 little one alone and with the sword this one 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 will be set dies the truth is that 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.410
 come out in the mines can come out in the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.110
 mines and it's pretty scary, it's not like 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.170
 equals with a video with all with all 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.690
 the same fears would emulate the blows 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.960
 god be you with your hard 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.800
 I do not think 44 hits and will give us this 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.800
 good position gives us 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.090
 gives us this to sing experience a 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.489
 experience boat and this is the little one 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.680
 then we have a bit of the normal lyon 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.510
 which, as you can see, is quite large and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.069
 he has a scary face he's already like 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.129
 rotated has the head with a kind 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:06.150
 of trash can rotated go down 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.980
 down bye bye goodbye does not die uncle 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.799
 they do not die anymore and they crawl 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.269
 the lava hello hi yo yo yo yo yo muerete 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.040
 And once you look, you see, I'm just 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.920
 drop a gem of these and then already 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.640
 we have hyper hiper mega mega jon that 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.860
 is this one 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.709
 my mother what piece of saying is go 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.040
 down you if my work is for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.680
 down 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.530
 my mother if you imagine that this is the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.470
 egg and suddenly it's hirai bones that do not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.020
 look look 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.320
 and here is the creative now if he hits me 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.360
 is that it does not hurt if you have 20 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.730
 hearts this and each and every blow 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.430
 I think it takes away 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.430
 and it takes away like two and a half something like that 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.540
 I could say I'm going to breathe too 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.990
 to inspire dies for dies you see endures 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.820
 very much and has blood here 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.540
 it's not bad it's not badly done a bit 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.370
 weird I do not know very white this is not a 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.040

 What have I done 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.639
 goodbye 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.199
 let's put three reasons one way 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.669
 quite curious that the truth is that or 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.340
 either because I stay on my computer to 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.360
 down man good medicare up 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.819
 expect me to love me up 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.620
 pulled up and nothing if you have any 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.210
 motorcycle well and also curious of this type 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.550
 because you can tell me and I'll do the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.319
 review as I say it's called jon mod and 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.030
 put a lot is good I put a lot and 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.650
 more because I have three good 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.599
 spaces neither more nor less I could add 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.550
 the bike a little more a little one 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.750
 cosilla plus the music and that the effects 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.240
 of music because it 's pretty good that 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.840
 the modes of fear is added this kind of 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.419
 things and I think of this this thing 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.520
 good of this video in this way there is no 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.220
 nothing more to say as I say is 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.740
 pretty cool if not because they were not 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.560
 it's cool so nothing I think with this 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.960
 I say goodbye I do not know if as I say if then 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.490
 I'll upload another good video I do not know how to be 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.139
 Attentive to twitter which is where I'm going 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.300
 to say things does not use the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.039
 description as in all my videos and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.479
