to go to your battery the ground wire

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.700 
to go to your battery the ground wire
which<00:00:34.179> goes<00:00:34.359> to<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.659> ground<00:00:35.289> or<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.559> negative

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
which goes to the ground or the negative

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.309 
which goes to the ground or the negative
terminal<00:00:36.039> and<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:36.659> top<00:00:37.659> of<00:00:37.809> it<00:00:37.899> which<00:00:38.050> goes<00:00:38.230> to

lastly the fifth just a single wire that

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.840 
lastly the fifth just a single wire that
will<00:00:43.690> plug<00:00:44.409> into<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.769> low<00:00:44.949> beam<00:00:45.129> position<00:00:45.640> and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
will plug into the low beam position and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.180 
will plug into the low beam position and
it<00:00:46.390> will<00:00:46.479> tell<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.289> relay<00:00:47.559> system<00:00:47.979> whether

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
it will tell the relay system whether

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
it will tell the relay system whether
they<00:00:48.370> have<00:00:48.489> lights<00:00:48.670> are<00:00:48.789> on<00:00:48.940> or<00:00:48.999> off<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:51.210> way

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
they have lights are on or off the way

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.160 
they have lights are on or off the way
the<00:00:52.359> system<00:00:52.389> works<00:00:52.780> is<00:00:53.469> that<00:00:55.050> instead<00:00:56.050> of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
the system works is that instead of

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.430 
the system works is that instead of
pulling<00:00:56.440> all<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.800> power<00:00:57.069> through<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.729> stock

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
pulling all the power through the stock

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.799 
pulling all the power through the stock
factory<00:00:59.440> wiring<00:00:59.920> harness<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:01.239> relay<00:01:01.510> allows

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
factory wiring harness the relay allows

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.830 
factory wiring harness the relay allows
you<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.319> pull<00:01:02.589> power<00:01:03.129> directly<00:01:03.670> from<00:01:04.660> the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
you to pull power directly from the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.010 
you to pull power directly from the
battery<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.230> your<00:01:05.560> ballot<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.840> are

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
battery to your ballot there are

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.340 
battery to your ballot there are
basically<00:01:08.410> three<00:01:09.390> reasons<00:01:10.390> why<00:01:10.540> people<00:01:10.840> go

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
basically three reasons why people go

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.660 
basically three reasons why people go
ahead<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.620> get<00:01:11.680> put<00:01:11.920> into<00:01:12.040> a<00:01:12.130> wire<00:01:12.310> harness

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
ahead and get put into a wire harness

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.820 
ahead and get put into a wire harness
for<00:01:12.880> one<00:01:13.090> it's<00:01:13.360> plug<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.630> play<00:01:13.930> everything

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
for one it's plug and play everything

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.440 
for one it's plug and play everything
connects<00:01:15.130> each<00:01:15.220> other<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:16.270> makes

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
connects each other and it makes

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.020 
connects each other and it makes
installation<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.320> much<00:01:17.470> easier<00:01:18.030> second

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
installation so much easier second

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.140 
installation so much easier second
reason<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.530> hasn't<00:01:21.370> relay<00:01:21.760> which

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
reason is that it hasn't relay which

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.380 
reason is that it hasn't relay which
actually<00:01:22.360> allows<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.890> provide<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.910> balance

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
actually allows you to provide a balance

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.750 
actually allows you to provide a balance
with<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.540> most<00:01:25.870> amount<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.230> power<00:01:26.770> directly

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
with the most amount of power directly

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.280 
with the most amount of power directly
from<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.150> batteries<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.750> are<00:01:28.780> pulling<00:01:29.170> all

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
from the batteries that are pulling all

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.060 
from the batteries that are pulling all
that<00:01:29.320> through<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.370> factory<00:01:30.970> harness

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that through the factory harness

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.780 
that through the factory harness
which<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.060> gold<00:01:33.210> safer<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.229> thirdly<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.430> comes

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
which is gold safer and thirdly it comes

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
which is gold safer and thirdly it comes
with<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> inline<00:01:36.479> fuse<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> event<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
with a inline fuse in the event that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.120 
with a inline fuse in the event that
there<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:39.050> spike<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.710> don't<00:01:40.890> pop

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
there is a spike that you don't pop

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
there is a spike that you don't pop
something<00:01:41.780> along<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> main<00:01:43.110> harness<00:01:43.380> but

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
something along the main harness but

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.570 
something along the main harness but
rather<00:01:44.210> attend<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> excuse<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.400> right<00:01:47.550> now

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
rather attend that excuse so right now

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.700 
rather attend that excuse so right now

we have mulligan everything hooked up
and<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:51.300> moment<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:52.229> normally<00:01:52.740> turn<00:01:53.040> on

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
and the moment I would normally turn on

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.310 
and the moment I would normally turn on
the<00:01:53.369> low<00:01:53.490> games<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.630> sends<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> signal<00:01:55.170> to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
of a 9006 plug balance you may end up

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.759 
of a 9006 plug balance you may end up
using<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:25.050> case<00:02:25.290> we're<00:02:25.440> using<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
using in this case we're using a

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.740 
using in this case we're using a
mustachioed<00:02:26.190> generation<00:02:26.700> three<00:02:26.910> valid<00:02:27.300> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
mustachioed generation three valid that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.630 
mustachioed generation three valid that
has<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> completely<00:02:28.680> different<00:02:29.130> power<00:02:29.459> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
has a completely different power and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
has a completely different power and
ground<00:02:29.790> plug<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.910> need<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.209> bends<00:02:33.540> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
ground plug so we need that bends you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.190 
ground plug so we need that bends you
need<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.900> cut<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.500> splice<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.209> resolder<00:02:36.209> be

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
need to cut and splice and resolder be

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830 
need to cut and splice and resolder be
the<00:02:37.260> more<00:02:37.470> wire<00:02:37.709> or<00:02:38.130> different<00:02:38.519> plug<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.720> what

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the more wire or different plug so what

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.550 
the more wire or different plug so what
I<00:02:39.870> did<00:02:40.319> here<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.620> went<00:02:40.860> ahead<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:42.200> cut<00:02:43.200> off<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
I did here is went ahead and cut off the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.530 
I did here is went ahead and cut off the
plug<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> 9006<00:02:45.750> ballad<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:47.390> we're<00:02:48.390> not

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
plug with a 9006 ballad and we're not

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
plug with a 9006 ballad and we're not
going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.260> start<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.920> much

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
going to going to start on a much

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.300 
going to going to start on a much
airplay<00:02:54.260> sometimes<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> color<00:02:55.590> varies<00:02:56.010> but

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
airplay sometimes the color varies but

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:09.200 
airplay sometimes the color varies but
black<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.640> always<00:02:56.880> 0<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.989> ground

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.770 

you

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.089 

we<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:12.930> either<00:03:13.019> hit<00:03:13.260> keep<00:03:13.500> training<00:03:13.800> use

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
we can either hit keep training use

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.949 
we can either hit keep training use
electrical<00:03:14.550> tape<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.810> make

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
electrical tape but you have to make

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.410 
electrical tape but you have to make
sure<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.319> these<00:03:16.500> uh<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.819> wives<00:03:18.060> are<00:03:18.269> not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
sure that these uh the wives are not

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:33.100 
sure that these uh the wives are not
exposed<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:21.379> well<00:03:22.379> insulated

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.880 

okay<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.409> we<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.530> everything

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
okay so here we have everything

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.910 
okay so here we have everything
installed<00:03:35.810> we've<00:03:36.810> got<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.049> ground<00:03:37.319> connected

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
installed we've got the ground connected

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.369 
installed we've got the ground connected
to<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> negative<00:03:38.580> terminal<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
to the negative terminal we have the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.119 
to the negative terminal we have the
power<00:03:40.730> connected<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:43.319> can<00:03:43.440> actually<00:03:43.560> see<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
power connected you can actually see the

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.880 
power connected you can actually see the
inline<00:03:44.700> fuse<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:46.319> can<00:03:46.440> even<00:03:46.560> see<00:03:46.680> the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
inline fuse here you can even see the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.440 
inline fuse here you can even see the
relay<00:03:47.190> located<00:03:47.670> back<00:03:47.819> here<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.670> then<00:03:50.730> over

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
relay located back here and then over

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.780 
relay located back here and then over
here<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.989> actually<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.129> single<00:03:53.610> wire

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
here we actually have the single wire

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.309 
here we actually have the single wire
that<00:03:54.060> will<00:03:54.209> sense<00:03:54.480> whether<00:03:54.750> they<00:03:54.989> headlights

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
that will sense whether they headlights

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.150 
that will sense whether they headlights
on<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.650> off<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.690> next<00:03:57.690> we're<00:03:57.930> going<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.349> turn

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
on and off and next we're going to turn

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.319 
on and off and next we're going to turn
everything<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.760> make<00:03:59.879> sure<00:04:00.000> everything<00:04:00.269> is

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
everything on to make sure everything is

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.540 
everything on to make sure everything is
working
