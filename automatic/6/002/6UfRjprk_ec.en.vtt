00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello my name is igor this is mine 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:09.300
 motivation today me training on 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.179
 deltas and plowed workouts I you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.500
 I'll tell you about my motivation right 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.500
 food held training 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.009
 started practicing 2003 for the first time 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.400
 came the hall weighed somewhere around 57 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.550
 kilogram with height 175 first 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.390
 the training was enough 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.510
 unclear 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.410
 more 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.060
 I looked at other than for 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.950
 mass 1 motivation for me was that 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.980
 big big guys tight 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.990
 dumbbells about weight with me and me 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.370
 I also wanted to gain weight pounds 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.740
 at that moment it seemed to me 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 go enough will need to squeeze and 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.370
 like that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.980
 in 2012 I spoke 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.260
 in bodybuilding competitions 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.530
 it was classic bodybuilding before 180 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.820
 centimeters ranked seventh is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.250
 I was upset on one side but 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.860
 by adults prompted and motivated yet 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.910
 stronger training more serious and 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 Now I plan to prepare for the autumn 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.280
 season and get into the top three 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 try to plan consists of four days 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.310
 basket tony individual muscle groups 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.440
 and being engaged I am quite intensive and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.080
 fast and clear for yourself 40 minutes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.710
 filler on on training cardio this is from 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.050
 20 to 40 minutes, most importantly that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.140
 using in training over two already 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.690
 years about this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.170
 almost all muscle supersets 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.880
 groups 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 most favorite is doing press right now 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.830
 dumbbells and immediately without resting perform 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.459
 swing dumbbell lifting to the sides then 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.440
 bivouac 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.440
 very well pumped up 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 like everyone at the beginning of the workouts were 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 mistakes in training first of all it is not 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.079
 hour subjects that is not engaged 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.689
 regularly the second is doing 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.180
 exercise is probably only part of the body 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.849
 eat this hands chest delta 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.519
 remember with a complete lack of exercise 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.170
 on foot which is now very affected 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.170
 weight . it's pretty hard 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.650
 three aspects of a successful workout to my 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.000
 a glance the first is the mood exactly on 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.720
 training that is, turn off all that 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 how annoying you 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.130
 outside the hall the principle of restoration 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.090
 that is, if you are not enough 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.940
 recovered 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.510
 you can't make that volume 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.630
 workouts who planned that is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.010
 overtraining 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 no use if you feel that training and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.680
 having passed according to plan 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.680
 worth it to do next 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.100
 the third moment is good music that is 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.440
 music that motivates you immerses 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.110
 fully into the workout 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.110
 disconnecting all that all that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.910
 we do not want proper nutrition very 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.220
 important bodybuilding thing in my opinion 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.960
 This is all a percentage of Russian and even more 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.490
 to expose caloric intake 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.620
 that is, it doesnâ€™t matter what you dial 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.380
 you need to pick up calories for 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.420
 your weight is given that is not to which 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.370
 you are aiming namely for the moment 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.260
 how much do you weigh how much do you have to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.770
 consume calories and one of the most 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.090
 important is the choice of the product we take exactly 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.160
 natural not ready his wife 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 factory are you and so on sausages and 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.600
 sordelki namely meat complex carbohydrates 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.070
 use as a set such reductions 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.480
 weights 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.190
 various sugars to minimize this 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.190
 fructose plus fat and fat are good for us 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.880
 our our physiology and they do not need 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.790
 exclude 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.010
 as well as typing or weight reduction 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.240
 But you need to use about one but 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.780
 grams of black place the body that is 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.300
 motivation 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.300
 but the motivation in my opinion is generally 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.670
 such a concept that does not exist 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.080
 there is a choice 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.190
 choice yes or no either you go up and 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.820
 train properly eat on 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.240
 doing 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.760
 anything you don't do any any 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.210
 you can draw an analogy let's say there is 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.130
 so let's say physiological sleep and 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.180
 not for a motivated person can 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:25.050
 say i'm not ready now either 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.110
 I have no opportunity no money so on 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.120
 that is, such here you would not have chosen if 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.390
 do nonsense until you reach your goals 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.740
 never mind bodybuilding his other spanking 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.830
 either any life purpose if you 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.560
 decided on this choice 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.590
 then you are doing and there are no excuses 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.590
 that I can not and did not have time I was late 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.280
 I want to wish all the people who 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.710
 to began to engage in setting goals for 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.169
 reach them 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.220
 slowly but surely that is not to wait let 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.880
 some of their results 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.430
 then when on my example 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.050
 it took 10 years to reach 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.910
 some certain i don't believe that 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:20.690
 and my up but something can be achieved any 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.820
 situations find a way out and find time for 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.670
 order to visit even the hall 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.270
 without any excuses and basically you 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.270
 achieve the result 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.740
 Togo 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.259
 what do you want for all while you were 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.810
 sting on the muscle channel if you 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:41.310
 liked the video like 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.310
 Comment and to new meetings bye
