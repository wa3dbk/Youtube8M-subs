00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
because I figured I spin wouldn't be

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.199 
because I figured I spin wouldn't be

forth under way that's like the reason

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.430 
forth under way that's like the reason
why<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.480> didn't<00:03:03.780> go<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.989> substitute<00:03:04.290> was

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
why I didn't go for substitute was

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.630 
why I didn't go for substitute was
because<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.739> thought<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.220> thing<00:03:05.459> with

because I thought that this thing with

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.270 
because I thought that this thing with

this<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.820> banded<00:04:36.419> Sharpedo<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.199> do<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.590> a

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
this is a banded Sharpedo I do have a

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.439 
this is a banded Sharpedo I do have a
chance<00:04:37.860> of<00:04:37.979> lunch<00:04:38.160> because<00:04:38.400> uh<00:04:38.610> what<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.360> was

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
chance of lunch because uh what if I was

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.670 
chance of lunch because uh what if I was
like<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.660> twenty<00:04:39.930> percent<00:04:40.169> chance<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.500> sleep

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
like a twenty percent chance to sleep

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.950 
like a twenty percent chance to sleep
and<00:04:41.090> he's<00:04:42.090> gonna<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.330> able<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.630> go<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
and he's gonna be able to go for the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.409 
and he's gonna be able to go for the
earthquake<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:44.460> not<00:04:44.760> gonna<00:04:44.940> kill<00:04:45.210> me

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
earthquake and it's not gonna kill me

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.210 
earthquake and it's not gonna kill me
but<00:04:45.599> it<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.900> gonna<00:04:46.080> put<00:04:46.440> me<00:04:46.470> in<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.680> range<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:47.130> her

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
but it is gonna put me in a range to her

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.040 
but it is gonna put me in a range to her
sandstorm<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.180> gonna<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.510> able<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.720> take<00:04:48.840> me

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
sandstorm is gonna be able to take me

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.839 
sandstorm is gonna be able to take me
out<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.949> right<00:04:50.160> here<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.340> figured<00:04:50.699> that

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
out so right here I figured that

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.040 
out so right here I figured that
venusaur<00:04:51.240> was<00:04:51.419> not<00:04:51.570> going<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.840> able<00:04:51.870> to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
venusaur was not going to be able to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.719 
venusaur was not going to be able to
have<00:04:52.110> speed<00:04:52.380> hip<00:04:52.949> island<00:04:53.310> because<00:04:53.520> it<00:04:53.639> is

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
have speed hip island because it is

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.760 
have speed hip island because it is
paralyzed<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.300> Machamp<00:04:55.139> could<00:04:55.410> take<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.680> out

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
paralyzed so Machamp could take it out

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.110 
paralyzed so Machamp could take it out
with<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.919> bang<00:04:56.220> punch<00:04:56.400> if<00:04:56.580> he<00:04:56.669> does<00:04:56.820> hit<00:04:57.000> himself

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
with a bang punch if he does hit himself

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.939 
with a bang punch if he does hit himself
in<00:04:57.449> confusion<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.229> i<00:04:58.260> go<00:04:58.470> for<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.650> dynamic

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
in confusion so i go for the dynamic

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.670 
in confusion so i go for the dynamic
punch<00:04:59.099> right<00:04:59.280> here<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.870> i<00:05:00.870> bring<00:05:01.380> him<00:05:01.530> down

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
punch right here and i bring him down

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.320 
punch right here and i bring him down
really<00:05:01.919> low<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.460> he's<00:05:02.789> not<00:05:02.970> gonna<00:05:03.060> be<00:05:03.150> able<00:05:03.210> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
really low and he's not gonna be able to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.969 
really low and he's not gonna be able to
kill<00:05:03.479> himself<00:05:03.599> the<00:05:03.840> confusion<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:04.470> i<00:05:04.650> will<00:05:04.860> be

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
kill himself the confusion but i will be

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.920 
kill himself the confusion but i will be
able<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.190> get<00:05:05.280> off<00:05:05.400> another<00:05:05.699> hit<00:05:05.970> but<00:05:06.570> he<00:05:06.720> gets

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
able to get off another hit but he gets

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.710 
able to get off another hit but he gets
me<00:05:07.050> with<00:05:07.199> an<00:05:07.320> earthquake<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.979> that<00:05:08.010> is<00:05:08.400> a

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
me with an earthquake and that is a

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.089 
me with an earthquake and that is a
gonna<00:05:09.720> put<00:05:09.870> mine<00:05:10.020> which<00:05:10.229> came<00:05:10.380> down<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.889> real

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
gonna put mine which came down to real

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.839 
gonna put mine which came down to real
amount<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.580> health<00:05:11.760> but<00:05:12.389> i<00:05:12.419> could<00:05:12.900> potentially

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
amount of health but i could potentially

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.700 
amount of health but i could potentially
still<00:05:14.849> take<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.270> CD<00:05:15.479> player<00:05:15.539> maybe<00:05:16.110> because

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
still take a CD player maybe because

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.640 
still take a CD player maybe because
this<00:05:17.039> Machamp<00:05:17.490> does<00:05:17.669> have<00:05:17.820> max<00:05:18.030> HP<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:19.199> so<00:05:19.620> i

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
this Machamp does have max HP and so i

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.080 
this Machamp does have max HP and so i
decided<00:05:20.039> to<00:05:20.099> go<00:05:20.220> for<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.400> substitute<00:05:20.880> because

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
decided to go for the substitute because

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.240 
decided to go for the substitute because
if<00:05:21.660> he<00:05:21.780> does<00:05:21.930> himself<00:05:22.169> in<00:05:22.440> confusion<00:05:22.860> i<00:05:23.070> can

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
if he does himself in confusion i can

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.800 
if he does himself in confusion i can
still<00:05:23.430> take<00:05:23.639> it<00:05:23.760> out<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:23.909> i<00:05:24.180> would<00:05:24.330> be<00:05:24.449> behind

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
still take it out and i would be behind

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.420 
still take it out and i would be behind
a<00:05:24.870> sub<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.770> it's<00:05:25.949> good<00:05:26.099> to<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.250> for<00:05:26.280> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
a sub so it's good to go for the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.939 
a sub so it's good to go for the
earthquake<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.060> he<00:05:27.810> snaps<00:05:28.229> out<00:05:28.349> of<00:05:28.409> confusion

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
earthquake and he snaps out of confusion

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.520 
earthquake and he snaps out of confusion
right<00:05:29.190> there<00:05:29.490> so<00:05:29.760> that's<00:05:30.060> just<00:05:30.380> that's<00:05:31.380> just

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
right there so that's just that's just

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.469 
right there so that's just that's just
my<00:05:31.740> plan<00:05:32.010> my<00:05:32.250> plan<00:05:32.310> just<00:05:32.639> got<00:05:32.820> destroyed<00:05:33.240> and

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
my plan my plan just got destroyed and

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.140 
my plan my plan just got destroyed and
now<00:05:34.289> his<00:05:34.650> hip<00:05:34.889> out<00:05:35.070> on<00:05:35.220> isn't<00:05:35.580> range<00:05:35.789> to<00:05:36.000> wear

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
now his hip out on isn't range to wear

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.969 
now his hip out on isn't range to wear
egg<00:05:36.330> dominic<00:05:36.960> lunch<00:05:37.199> will<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.500> able<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.830> take

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
egg dominic lunch will be able to take

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.080 
egg dominic lunch will be able to take
it<00:05:38.099> out<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.220> that's<00:05:38.490> pretty<00:05:38.789> unfortunate

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
it out and that's pretty unfortunate

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.149 
it out and that's pretty unfortunate
because<00:05:39.389> if<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.900> wasn't<00:05:40.289> i<00:05:40.440> could<00:05:40.889> have<00:05:41.010> still

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
because if it wasn't i could have still

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.939 
because if it wasn't i could have still
had<00:05:41.370> one<00:05:41.669> more<00:05:41.729> opportunity<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.630> have<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.710> sub

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
had one more opportunity to have a sub

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.490 
had one more opportunity to have a sub
up<00:05:44.130> against<00:05:44.610> his<00:05:44.729> next<00:05:45.060> pokemon<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:45.750> that

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
up against his next pokemon and that

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.740 
up against his next pokemon and that
would<00:05:46.590> have<00:05:46.620> been<00:05:46.710> very<00:05:47.039> very<00:05:47.370> ideal<00:05:47.909> because

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
would have been very very ideal because

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.420 
would have been very very ideal because
I<00:05:49.110> would<00:05:49.260> have<00:05:49.349> basically<00:05:49.830> gone<00:05:50.099> to<00:05:50.280> free

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
I would have basically gone to free

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.270 
I would have basically gone to free
dynamic

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
dynamic

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.160 
dynamic
and<00:05:51.610> Venus<00:05:52.389> or<00:05:52.540> could<00:05:52.720> have<00:05:52.810> done<00:05:52.930> something

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
and Venus or could have done something

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.410 
and Venus or could have done something
to<00:05:53.500> his<00:05:53.620> team<00:05:53.770> but<00:05:54.070> his<00:05:54.550> last<00:05:54.790> pokemon<00:05:55.030> is

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
to his team but his last pokemon is

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.410 
to his team but his last pokemon is
gonna<00:05:55.630> be<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:56.020> frickin<00:05:56.530> chin<00:05:57.400> Chino<00:05:57.790> and<00:05:58.210> I

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
gonna be a frickin chin Chino and I

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.879 
gonna be a frickin chin Chino and I
still<00:05:58.480> thought<00:05:58.840> that<00:05:58.990> his<00:05:59.050> last<00:05:59.200> pokemon<00:05:59.470> was

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
still thought that his last pokemon was

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.980 
still thought that his last pokemon was
