 Internet access function 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 and not in the traditional way with 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 using 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.970
 computer 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
 internet tv broadcasting organizations 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.580
 it's clear that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.320
 the signal comes from the center of the well 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 TV delegations 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.080

 then he is on academician usually 5 4 and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 converts a harsh name 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 further in order to publish streams 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 already one on the internet

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.320
 relevant data centers 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.409
 the number of which depends on 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.330
 maximum amount 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.560
 simultaneously watching 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.600
 in the Internet 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.439
 what are the main prerequisites of creation 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.060
 the project 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.980
 vinter product 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.380
 the first is the penetration rate 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.790
 broadband access in Russia 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.020
 is 17 and six tenths of a percent 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.200
 for may 2009 what is 9 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.420
 million 430 6 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.700
 Thousands of five people and wait and and with children 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.790
 Internet broadcasting 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 per visitor 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.730
 Today is cheaper than any other in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.259
 indoor environment 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 Well, at least it is two or more times 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.749
 me 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.049
 cheaper and finally zao today 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.839
 the internet is the only 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.839
 global medium digital broadcasting 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.299
 it is a cost effective way 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.899
 television delivery 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.259
 channel to any point 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.439
 or any operator of Russia and the world at 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.779
 the presence of 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.779
 broadband internet access 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.150
 the second is access control to 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.480
 watching television 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.469
 channel 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.859
 depending on the country of location of the subscriber and 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.379
 depending on its authorization, well, or 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.239
 registration 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.159
 specific subscriber can accommodate 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.790
 advertising on the corresponding 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.360
 television resources 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.550
 or online or changed 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.020
 corresponding internet tv and 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.249
 consoles 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.469
 or they are not about specific models 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.919
 TVs equipped 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.349
 in the internet access function 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.099
 and another very important thing for the first time only in 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.659
 this environment is possible monthly readout 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.629
 quantity percentage of connection and time 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.739
 looking at the looking structure 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.319
 what today 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.089
 impossible in other environments and as you know 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.429
 is done 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.829
 I am not very accurate methods namely 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.729
 by methods 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.509
 polling r3 half a meter country and so on and 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:37.270
 etc 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.770
 and here is absolute clear reporting for 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.770
 each per channel 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.579
 benefits to the viewers this 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.479
 free TV viewing 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.259
 at least eight qualities 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.699
 russian television 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.409
 channels according to presidential decree 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.439
 Russian Federation 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.449
 This is the ability to view up to one hundred 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.919
 Russian channels with quality up to 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.569
 high definition television 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.389
 this is complete independence from 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.839
 location 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.419
 viewers 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.499
 today high definition channels famously definition 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.479
 content 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.029
 views over 90 percent 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.840
 consumers 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.200
 and further with regard to the prediction of the Turks 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.370
 Internet of that and me and Beijing 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.210
 together the end of 2015 will give 45 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.650
 percent of the total 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.240
 subscribers 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.280
 well, actually 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.080
 finally look to invite to 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.790
 cooperation as a television camera company 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.030
 so in the case of air traffic 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.010
 content and relevant 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.949
 prefixes 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:45.789
 and invited to cooperate 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.490
 owners

 like managing popular videos 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.620
 city ​​n internet resources
