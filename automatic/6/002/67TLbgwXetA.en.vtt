00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.099
 well, thank you very much 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.099
 I usually call back 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 and I will appeal even when we do not 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 do not ask me about this noise when we 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.250
 think a little bit we see when 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.010
 same as all discoveries are 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.449
 recent 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:35.059
 for example yes to the microcomputer to 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.510
 30 years old 70 years old 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.840
 all mobile a little more than a century 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.769
 wheel 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.769
 if milan the wheelbarrow 7000 years 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.510
 no i did not make a mistake i 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.839
 stammered a bit I meant that the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:02.229
 wheel was invented 6000 years ago and some 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:06.610
 wheelbarrows not by counting large and 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.750
 being nice we can say that everything is 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.720
 discovered for less than ten thousand years 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 the lobe exists at least since more 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.600
 millions in so if we do the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.399
 substraction 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.270
 why because a multiplication that 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:37.229
 should not anything from the subtraction the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:48.159
 subtraction one million months ten thousand 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:49.450
 it's 9,190 thousand years old so I ask 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.250
 question 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 the question is therefore asked 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 and for now the question is resting 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.990
 I'm leaning slightly on the question 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.720
 and as long as I follow it quickly 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 I go around the question the la 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:26.140
 what do men do during 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:29.200
 990 million to the words Thursday that the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.480
 prehistoric men had already 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.069
 drawn shake and I can repeat 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.049
 because I prehistoric men 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 I do not need to be afraid of men 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.090
 prehistoric 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:51.630
 I love them and the women of the sluts 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.630
 princeton 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.510
 I hear the disapproval of what 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.920
 I suppose to be feminisms but I 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.240
 their will to affirm to feminists and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.510
 then accomplice 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.060
 that we have the scientific proof that no 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.110
 not everything but that moult woman 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.090
 prehistoric and pts the evidence there are 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.780
 a few years ago we found 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.780
 fossils by the hour 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.739
 Besides, I'm going to imitate you 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.459
 hottie press I 'm going to turn around 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.459
 play the crime 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:58.010
 here is a bitch caught tweete 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:02.030
 young people but do not batteries and manage my 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.530
 big links I stay in effect 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.530
 while shopping in Morocco 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.440
 it may not be very well imitated 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.650
 but it's not easy because it's translated 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.549
 a dead language 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.840
 so archaeologists have found peace 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.160
 but it has taken shape 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.620
 a small pile of bones that they put 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.370
 end-to-end as a puzzle a mood 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.139
 500 pieces and they called it the uci 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.070
 yes, there are some who wanted to call it 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:41.100
 yvette and lucie the little heap we do not 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.699
 do not know the exact date of his death 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:53.530
 but according to international experts 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:58.300
 peri urban luci would have died that was at 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.419
 natural death Monday after the 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.740
 gendarmerie report 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.030
 but maybe too and that's a lot 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.000
 more worrying for the future 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.699
 for lack of care after a 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:20.110
 Perigordian social worker besides the 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:24.130
 family drama I think of the sorrow of his 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.139
 skin family I say that instead of 10 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.500
 proud menhirs and menhirs barely 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.380
 verticals and dolmens dolmens to 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.840
 half banco 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.550
 prehistoric men in the east 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.950
 welcome made build hospitals in 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.680
 more like the good houses they 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.130
 were beating between them for a cave for 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.600
 a cave for holes always at the 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:55.170
 search for a natural hole and dance 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.430
 and where he lives naked like beasts in the 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.190
 best case a fig leaf 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.030
 is still a grape leaf but not 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:06.560
 everywhere a fig leaf only 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.560
 of the wine region 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:15.680
 gold right down to these caverns room is a 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.680
 pretty brothel in homo erectus 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.890
 and that explains us nothing but nothing 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.150
 to fuck the day what is it 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.470
 did to pass the time and you in 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.540
 have time to lose men 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.050
 prehistoric place too shameless you are 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.620
 too shameless to milk a mammoth 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.620
 what was he doing 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:47.800
 but he drew but must see 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:52.990
 it goes down we do not know if it was a 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.350
 goat or cow a bird or a 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.350
 plane 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:06.550
 there is even a prehistoric merl 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.400
 who's attacking and his tackle he's scored 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:14.220
 top hand 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.220
 twenty thousand years before bc
