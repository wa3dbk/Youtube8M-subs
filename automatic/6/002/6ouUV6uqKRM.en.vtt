00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
okay so now that we've seen the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay so now that we've seen the
differences<00:00:08.220> between<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.910> different<00:00:09.179> years

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
differences between the different years

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
about power you know everybody wants to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.360 
about power you know everybody wants to
know<00:00:12.450> which<00:00:13.170> one's<00:00:13.410> better<00:00:13.620> which<00:00:14.040> one's<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
know which one's better which one's the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
best you know if I want to make power if

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.060 
best you know if I want to make power if
I<00:00:16.260> want<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> tell<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.949> do

this LML is a similar situation okay so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
this LML is a similar situation okay so
how<00:01:13.229> much<00:01:13.409> air<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.280> flow<00:01:15.200> through<00:01:16.549> that

compressor wheel at atmospheric pressure

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.179 
compressor wheel at atmospheric pressure
is<00:01:20.390> essentially<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> limiting<00:01:21.810> factor<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.070> we

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is essentially the limiting factor so we

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
is essentially the limiting factor so we
can<00:01:23.310> only<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:24.090> energy<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
can only get so much energy out of this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
can only get so much energy out of this
turbine<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> only<00:01:27.030> drive<00:01:27.330> this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
turbine side and we can only drive this
compressor<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> hard<00:01:28.439> before<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.860> either

explodes or just starts moving hot air

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490 
explodes or just starts moving hot air
that<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.180> air<00:01:33.689> mass<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.290> moving

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that is the air mass that it's moving

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.429 
that is the air mass that it's moving
does<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.450> appreciably<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> boost

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
does not appreciably go up for the boost
number<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> let's<00:01:40.560> talk<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.860> measurements

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
number so let's talk about measurements

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
number so let's talk about measurements
a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.090> bit<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.869> start<00:01:43.049> reading<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
a little bit you start reading the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
a little bit you start reading the
forum's<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.860> start<00:01:44.070> looking<00:01:44.340> online<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
forum's you start looking online you're

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.999 
forum's you start looking online you're
gonna<00:01:44.970> hear<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> bunch<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.630> different

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
gonna hear a bunch of different

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.550 
gonna hear a bunch of different

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.380 
sizing that kind of stuff thrown around
so<00:01:51.270> let's<00:01:51.360> talk<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> means<00:01:53.390> on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so let's talk about what that means on

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.069 
so let's talk about what that means on
the<00:01:54.450> compressor<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.939> couple<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the compressor side you have a couple of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.469 
the compressor side you have a couple of
different<00:01:58.170> measurements<00:01:58.979> actually<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.360> go

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
different measurements actually we go

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200 
different measurements actually we go
with<00:02:00.630> three<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> bore<00:02:02.430> size<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
with three so you have the bore size so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
with three so you have the bore size so
when<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> enter<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> sled<00:02:04.200> pulling<00:02:04.530> class<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
when you enter a sled pulling class you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.319 
when you enter a sled pulling class you
have<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.070> bore<00:02:05.369> he<00:02:05.610> might<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> two<00:02:06.090> five

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
have the bore he might have a two five

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.109 
have the bore he might have a two five
class<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.110> six<00:02:07.409> class<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
class or two six class that would be a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.820 
class or two six class that would be a
two<00:02:09.599> five<00:02:09.780> class<00:02:10.080> would<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.379> class<00:02:10.619> that's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
two five class would be a class that's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.370 
two five class would be a class that's
checked<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> 2.5<00:02:11.910> oh<00:02:11.970> five<00:02:12.300> slug

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
checked with a 2.5 oh five slug

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
checked with a 2.5 oh five slug
the<00:02:13.590> slug<00:02:13.860> gets<00:02:14.220> hung<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.330> bore<00:02:15.540> then

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the slug gets hung up in the bore then

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
the slug gets hung up in the bore then
it's<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.110> legal<00:02:16.380> turbocharger<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.580> slug

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it's a legal turbocharger if the slug

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.490 
it's a legal turbocharger if the slug
can<00:02:17.940> plug<00:02:18.210> can<00:02:18.420> pass<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> wheel<00:02:19.080> that's<00:02:19.350> an

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
can plug can pass to the wheel that's an

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.790 
can plug can pass to the wheel that's an
illegal<00:02:19.710> turbocharger<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:22.260> measurement<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
illegal turbocharger that measurement is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.420 
illegal turbocharger that measurement is
done<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:24.060> bore<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> compressor<00:02:25.050> cover

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
done on the bore of the compressor cover

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.590 
done on the bore of the compressor cover
okay<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.790> guys<00:02:27.210> talking<00:02:27.570> about

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
okay then you have guys talking about

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600 
okay then you have guys talking about
wheels<00:02:27.990> well<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> 63<00:02:29.160> millimeter

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
wheels well it's got a 63 millimeter

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520 
wheels well it's got a 63 millimeter
wheel<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> clearance<00:02:31.350> between

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
wheel now there's a clearance between

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.990 
wheel now there's a clearance between
the<00:02:31.770> wheel<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.160> cover<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> measure

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the wheel and the cover so the measure

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.340 
the wheel and the cover so the measure
the<00:02:33.210> cover<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.960> match<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the cover is not going to match the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.310 
the cover is not going to match the
measure<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> wheel<00:02:35.360> there's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> stock<00:02:36.720> LLY

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
measure of the wheel there's a stock LLY

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.280 
measure of the wheel there's a stock LLY
wheel<00:02:40.400> about<00:02:41.400> 60<00:02:41.820> millimeters<00:02:42.330> okay<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
wheel about 60 millimeters okay so you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680 
wheel about 60 millimeters okay so you
hear<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> lot<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.680> upgrade<00:02:43.950> turbocharger<00:02:44.690> 6368

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
hear a lot of upgrade turbocharger 6368

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.590 
hear a lot of upgrade turbocharger 6368
66<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:47.340> would<00:02:47.520> mean<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.970> inducer

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
66 that would mean that this inducer

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.150 
66 that would mean that this inducer
section<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.170> compressor<00:02:49.710> wheel<00:02:49.890> is

and the X deucer

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.150 
and the X deucer
the<00:02:55.200> X<00:02:55.320> deuce<00:02:55.500> would<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.830> widest

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the X deuce would be the widest

square<00:03:44.490> or<00:03:44.760> over<00:03:45.030> square<00:03:45.390> on<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.690> turbine

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
square or over square on the turbine

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.360 
square or over square on the turbine
side<00:03:46.200> meaning<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> turbine<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:46.980> larger<00:03:47.280> than

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
side meaning the turbine is larger than

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.830 
side meaning the turbine is larger than
the<00:03:47.459> compressor<00:03:47.910> wheel<00:03:48.060> works<00:03:48.450> out<00:03:48.660> really

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
the compressor wheel works out really

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.480 
the compressor wheel works out really
well<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:50.270> show<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.480> vanes<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.900> little<00:03:52.110> bit

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
well I show you the vanes a little bit

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.830 
well I show you the vanes a little bit
okay<00:03:53.490> so<00:03:53.520> these<00:03:53.790> vanes<00:03:54.090> are<00:03:54.330> constantly

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
okay so these vanes are constantly

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.180 
okay so these vanes are constantly
moving<00:03:55.140> as<00:03:55.380> you're<00:03:55.500> driving<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.920> truck

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
moving as you're driving the truck

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.710 
moving as you're driving the truck
they're<00:03:56.370> constantly<00:03:56.820> adjusting<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
they're constantly adjusting to get a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.860 
they're constantly adjusting to get a
more<00:03:58.590> or<00:03:58.620> less<00:03:59.030> velocity<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.510> turbine

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
more or less velocity on the turbine

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.370 
more or less velocity on the turbine
more<00:04:01.170> or<00:04:01.350> less<00:04:01.500> boost<00:04:01.890> or<00:04:02.730> drive<00:04:03.000> pressure

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
more or less boost or drive pressure

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.190 
more or less boost or drive pressure
okay<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.240> a<00:04:06.270> really<00:04:06.540> cool<00:04:06.720> deal<00:04:06.930> because

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
okay this is a really cool deal because

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.199 
okay this is a really cool deal because
it<00:04:07.320> can<00:04:07.440> make<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> larger<00:04:08.250> turbocharger<00:04:08.580> spool

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
it can make a larger turbocharger spool

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.880 
it can make a larger turbocharger spool
up<00:04:09.360> quicker<00:04:09.630> or<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.350> can<00:04:10.470> give<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.709> that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
up quicker or it can give you that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.960 
up quicker or it can give you that
engine<00:04:11.610> braking<00:04:11.850> on<00:04:12.090> decel<00:04:13.670> when<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.760> hear

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
engine braking on decel when you hear

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.430 
engine braking on decel when you hear
vane<00:04:15.180> position<00:04:15.630> reference<00:04:16.020> you'll<00:04:16.170> hear<00:04:16.350> it

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
vane position reference you'll hear it

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.020 
vane position reference you'll hear it
in<00:04:16.470> percentage<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:17.489> zero<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> hundred

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
in percentage so zero to a hundred

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.479 
in percentage so zero to a hundred
percent<00:04:18.320> 100<00:04:19.320> percent<00:04:19.350> would<00:04:19.830> be<00:04:19.950> completely

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
percent 100 percent would be completely

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.940 
percent 100 percent would be completely
closed<00:04:20.910> vanes<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.540> they're<00:04:21.989> not<00:04:22.140> completely

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
closed vanes and they're not completely

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.150 
closed vanes and they're not completely
closed<00:04:23.340> there<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.700> some<00:04:23.910> clearance<00:04:24.300> there

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
closed there is some clearance there

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.340 
closed there is some clearance there
but<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.550> would<00:04:25.670> be<00:04:25.870> similar<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.140> where

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
but that would be similar to this where

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.630 
but that would be similar to this where
there's<00:04:27.500> very<00:04:27.560> little<00:04:27.890> room<00:04:28.100> between<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
there's very little room between the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.130 
there's very little room between the
veins<00:04:28.850> for<00:04:29.600> exhaust<00:04:29.900> gas<00:04:30.140> to<00:04:30.350> flow<00:04:31.930> as<00:04:32.930> this

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
veins for exhaust gas to flow as this

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.100 
veins for exhaust gas to flow as this
unison<00:04:33.560> ring<00:04:33.800> moves<00:04:34.100> clockwise<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:35.720> can<00:04:35.900> see

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
unison ring moves clockwise you can see

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.960 
unison ring moves clockwise you can see
that<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.350> veins<00:04:36.560> open<00:04:36.920> up<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.340> there's<00:04:37.730> a<00:04:37.790> lot

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
that the veins open up and there's a lot

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.250 
that the veins open up and there's a lot

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
more room for exhaust gas to flow when

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.510 
more room for exhaust gas to flow when
you're<00:04:42.380> starting<00:04:42.650> off<00:04:42.890> you're<00:04:43.100> gonna<00:04:43.160> start

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
you're starting off you're gonna start

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.790 
you're starting off you're gonna start
at<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.790> fairly<00:04:44.570> closed<00:04:44.840> position<00:04:45.410> you

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
at that fairly closed position you

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.650 
at that fairly closed position you
immediately<00:04:46.250> hit<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.460> throttle<00:04:46.700> as<00:04:47.000> boost

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
immediately hit the throttle as boost

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.780 
immediately hit the throttle as boost
builds<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.260> exhaust<00:04:48.560> gas<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:49.130> volume<00:04:49.490> or

builds and exhaust gas and volume or
exhaust<00:04:50.180> gas<00:04:50.360> mass<00:04:51.610> climbs<00:04:52.660> you're<00:04:53.660> gonna

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
exhaust gas mass climbs you're gonna

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.810 
exhaust gas mass climbs you're gonna
continue<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.200> open<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.530> veins<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.100> as<00:04:55.640> you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
continue to open the veins and as you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.760 
continue to open the veins and as you
get<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.180> get<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.900> full<00:04:57.110> throttle<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.530> veins

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
get to get to full throttle the veins

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.650 
get to get to full throttle the veins
may<00:04:57.980> settle<00:04:58.400> just<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.820> little<00:04:59.060> bit<00:04:59.150> over<00:04:59.330> zero

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
may settle just a little bit over zero

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.200 
may settle just a little bit over zero
so<00:04:59.990> between<00:05:00.200> 0<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.650> 30<00:05:00.830> percent<00:05:01.280> zero<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.760> 40

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
so between 0 and 30 percent zero and 40

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.540 
so between 0 and 30 percent zero and 40
percent<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:03.680> just<00:05:03.860> depends<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.250> shape<00:05:04.430> of

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
percent it just depends on the shape of

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.810 
percent it just depends on the shape of
the<00:05:04.640> veins<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:04.970> what<00:05:05.150> your<00:05:05.300> turbocharger

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the veins and what your turbocharger

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.970 
the veins and what your turbocharger
kind<00:05:07.820> of<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:07.940> cool<00:05:08.090> setup<00:05:08.380> we<00:05:09.380> see<00:05:09.500> most<00:05:09.830> of

kind of a cool setup we see most of

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.140 
kind of a cool setup we see most of
