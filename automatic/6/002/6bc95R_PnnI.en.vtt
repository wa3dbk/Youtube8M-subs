the body is 245 thousand miles on it the
motor<00:00:23.380> has<00:00:24.180> 35,000<00:00:25.180> miles<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:30.670> the

motor has 35,000 miles on it for the

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.079 
motor has 35,000 miles on it for the
most<00:00:30.910> part<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.570> RS<00:00:32.230> with<00:00:32.500> all<00:00:33.249> SC<00:00:33.789> stuff

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
most part it's a RS with all SC stuff

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:35.879 
most part it's a RS with all SC stuff
the<00:00:34.269> hatch<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.629> off<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:34.929> SC<00:00:35.199> it's<00:00:35.350> got<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.559> SE

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:35.889 
the hatch is off in SC it's got the SE

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:41.579 
the hatch is off in SC it's got the SE
mud<00:00:36.100> flaps<00:00:36.399> got<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.789> SE<00:00:37.149> front<00:00:37.479> lip<00:00:39.839> but<00:00:40.839> yeah

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
mud flaps got the SE front lip but yeah

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.259 
mud flaps got the SE front lip but yeah
that's<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.889> exterior<00:00:42.429> I<00:00:42.609> do<00:00:42.670> have<00:00:42.969> all<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269

that's the exterior I do have all the
rims<00:00:43.479> or<00:00:43.719> just<00:00:43.870> not<00:00:44.019> on<00:00:44.609> ranked<00:00:45.609> it<00:00:45.729> to<00:00:45.850> the

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
rims or just not on ranked it to the

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.270 
rims or just not on ranked it to the
inside<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.600> got<00:00:49.749> a<00:00:49.809> complete<00:00:50.229> se<00:00:50.620> interior

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
inside it's got a complete se interior

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:05.630 
inside it's got a complete se interior
and<00:00:51.639> it's<00:00:51.999> very<00:00:52.209> minty<00:01:03.510> mean<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.600> leathers

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and it's very minty mean the leathers

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:18.840 
and it's very minty mean the leathers
barely<00:01:06.640> worn

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:27.130 

stand<00:01:19.850> up

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.380 

so<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> RS<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> has<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.640> B<00:01:33.000> 60

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
so this is the RS so it has the B 60

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.639 
so this is the RS so it has the B 60
which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> 1.6<00:01:34.500> liter<00:01:34.770> four-cylinder<00:01:35.600> but

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
which is a 1.6 liter four-cylinder but

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:46.899 
which is a 1.6 liter four-cylinder but
pull<00:01:37.649> out<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.920> second

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.279 

this<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.390> pulled<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.840> 95<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
this one has been pulled out of a 95 and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.139 
this one has been pulled out of a 95 and
fully<00:01:49.649> rebuilt<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.219> when<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> say<00:01:50.700> new<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> mean

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's a board 20 over so it's a one point

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.690 
it's a board 20 over so it's a one point
seven<00:01:56.130> liter<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:58.200> only<00:01:58.590> leak<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.520> on

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
this as power steering right there it's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.469 
this as power steering right there it's
got<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.929> new<00:02:04.110> AC<00:02:04.259> compressor<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.920> new<00:02:05.069> radiator

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
intake manifold I think is been ported I

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.960 
intake manifold I think is been ported I
mean<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.959> can't<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.380> mean<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.890> over<00:02:17.400> six<00:02:17.640> thousand

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
dollars in new parts and I've ever

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.010 
dollars in new parts and I've ever
receipt<00:02:19.950> came<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> car

exhaust on it its stock but it's a two
and<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> quarter<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.610> little

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and a quarter and so it's a little

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.510 
and a quarter and so it's a little
louder<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:40.180> got<00:02:40.330> two<00:02:40.570> tens<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> back
