00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
him as well who knows scored three goals

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960 
him as well who knows scored three goals
which<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.719> fantastic<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.520> concede

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
which is fantastic but you know concede

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.519 
which is fantastic but you know concede
in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> three<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.449> not<00:00:18.630> quite<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.050> great<00:00:19.260> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
in the three is not quite so great so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.910 
in the three is not quite so great so
I'm<00:00:20.119> looking<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.330> under<00:00:21.750> positive<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.529> tend

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I'm looking on under positive and I tend

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.519 
I'm looking on under positive and I tend
to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> glass<00:00:23.550> half-full<00:00:24.500> you<00:00:25.500> know

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
to do that glass half-full you know

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
to do that glass half-full you know
scoring<00:00:26.160> goals<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> problem<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.359> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
scoring goals is not a problem if we can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
scoring goals is not a problem if we can
just<00:00:27.570> tighten<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:29.519> were

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
just tighten up a little bit which were

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
just tighten up a little bit which were
more<00:00:29.880> than<00:00:29.910> capable<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.420> doing<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:31.590> suddenly

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
more than capable of doing then suddenly

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.280 
more than capable of doing then suddenly
these<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.550> fantastic<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.809> hard<00:00:34.050> earned

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
these these fantastic really hard earned

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.040 
these these fantastic really hard earned
the<00:00:34.469> waypoints<00:00:35.239> can<00:00:36.239> become<00:00:36.540> away<00:00:36.780> wings

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the waypoints can become away wings

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
the waypoints can become away wings
which<00:00:37.320> suddenly<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.640> climb

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
which suddenly will really see you climb

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
which suddenly will really see you climb
up<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> table<00:00:39.329> down<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:40.350> our

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
up the table down so that's that's our

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
up the table down so that's that's our
target<00:00:40.770> sra<00:00:41.340> minutes<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.879> striving<00:00:42.270> for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
target sra minutes what we striving for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
target sra minutes what we striving for
and<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.960> course<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> games<00:00:43.710> coming<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and of course with the games coming so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
and of course with the games coming so
thick<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.640> fast<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.360> difficult<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.680> have

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
thick and fast it's difficult to have

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
thick and fast it's difficult to have
that<00:00:47.039> time<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> training<00:00:47.730> pitch<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.420> work

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that time on the training pitch to work

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.029 
that time on the training pitch to work
together<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:49.079> those<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> defensive

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
together in those kind of defensive

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
together in those kind of defensive
shapes<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.600> use<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.020> an

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
shapes or you don't use that as an

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
shapes or you don't use that as an
excuse<00:00:52.469> no<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.489> excuse<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.000> we've

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
at home so there's no reason why we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.180 
at home so there's no reason why we
can't<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.820> away<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:00.270> home<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.629> more<00:01:00.870> a

that really so it's a little we'll get

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
that really so it's a little we'll get
there<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.229> take<00:01:07.590> take<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.700> time

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there we will take take a bit more time

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
there we will take take a bit more time
bit<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.210> work<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.390> we're<00:01:09.780> continually

in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> stadium<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.430> there<00:01:53.430> seems<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> be

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
in the stadium I think there seems to be

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
in the stadium I think there seems to be
as<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> say<00:01:54.329> there's<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> resilience<00:01:55.950> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
as you say there's a resilience that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.149 
as you say there's a resilience that
just<00:01:56.670> wasn't<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.450> before<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.799> also

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just wasn't there before but that also

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.740 
just wasn't there before but that also
comes<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.759> confidence<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> belief

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
comes from the confidence and the belief

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
comes from the confidence and the belief
in<00:02:00.990> getting<00:02:01.409> those<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> results<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
in getting those kind of results and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.670 
in getting those kind of results and
grinding<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:02.969> results<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.570> well<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.469> does

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
grinding out results as well it does

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.139 
grinding out results as well it does

proposition I like to think from

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.840 
proposition I like to think from
probably<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.740> first<00:03:09.950> sort<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.490> selling<00:03:10.700> games

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
probably the first sort of selling games

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.710 
probably the first sort of selling games
of<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.000> season<00:03:11.210> but<00:03:12.070> as<00:03:13.070> one<00:03:13.400> thing<00:03:13.730> knowing

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
of the season but as one thing knowing

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480 
of the season but as one thing knowing
what<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.960> team<00:03:15.230> are<00:03:15.410> likely<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.130> theirs<00:03:16.400> and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
what a team are likely to do theirs and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.040 
what a team are likely to do theirs and
other<00:03:16.610> things<00:03:16.940> being<00:03:17.150> able<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.450> stop<00:03:17.630> them<00:03:17.840> you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
other things being able to stop them you
