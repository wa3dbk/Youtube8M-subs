00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
and then I clumb your map is so big when

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.640 
and then I clumb your map is so big when
we<00:00:12.419> make<00:00:12.599> them<00:00:12.749> they're<00:00:12.959> really<00:00:13.079> small<00:00:13.469> like

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
we make them they're really small like

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.509 
we make them they're really small like
this<00:00:13.829> one<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.160> here

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
this one right here

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.020 
this one right here
so<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.370> let's<00:00:17.370> make<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> map<00:00:17.820> real

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
so what you do is let's make a map real

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.290 
so what you do is let's make a map real
quick<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.530> a<00:00:19.560> map<00:00:19.830> by<00:00:20.160> first<00:00:21.120> making

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
quick and you make a map by first making

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.890 
quick and you make a map by first making
a<00:00:21.510> compass<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.900> redstone

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
a compass so you have to do one redstone

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.270 
a compass so you have to do one redstone
and<00:00:25.340> four<00:00:26.660> pieces<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.780> iron<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.070> makes

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
and four pieces of iron and that makes

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.749 
and four pieces of iron and that makes
your<00:00:29.610> compass<00:00:30.120> put<00:00:30.840> your<00:00:30.960> compass<00:00:31.290> back<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
your compass put your compass back in to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.900 
your compass put your compass back in to
your<00:00:33.449> crafting<00:00:34.109> table<00:00:34.289> and<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.519> make<00:00:35.670> paper

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and it will form a larger map and it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.779 
and it will form a larger map and it
takes<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> couple<00:01:25.049> seconds<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> create<00:01:26.460> or

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
takes a couple seconds to create or

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.599 
takes a couple seconds to create or
generate<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:28.020> believe<00:01:28.289> we<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.859> more

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
generate and I believe we can do it more

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.599 
generate and I believe we can do it more
times<00:01:29.969> than<00:01:30.210> once<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:32.070> click<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.430> my

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
times than once so I right click on my

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.370 
times than once so I right click on my
crafting<00:01:33.000> table<00:01:33.149> again<00:01:33.539> let's<00:01:33.899> bring<00:01:34.049> our<00:01:34.200> map

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
crafting table again let's bring our map

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.240 
crafting table again let's bring our map
back<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:36.079> we'll<00:01:37.079> put<00:01:37.109> eight<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.740> pieces<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
back in we'll put eight more pieces of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.529 
back in we'll put eight more pieces of
paper<00:01:38.399> around<00:01:42.530> we'll<00:01:43.530> open<00:01:43.829> our<00:01:44.159> map<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.640> nope

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
paper around we'll open our map up nope

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.669 
paper around we'll open our map up nope
so<00:01:45.990> only<00:01:46.140> does<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.409> twice<00:01:48.200> let's<00:01:49.200> try<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.469> one

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
so only does it twice let's try it one

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.510 
so only does it twice let's try it one
more<00:01:49.710> time<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.979> think<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> tried<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
more time just to see I think I tried it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.999 
more time just to see I think I tried it
earlier<00:01:53.609> just<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> see<00:01:54.359> make<00:01:55.350> sure<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> knew<00:01:55.799> all

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
earlier just to see make sure I knew all

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.720 
earlier just to see make sure I knew all
the<00:01:56.039> ins<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> outs

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
the ins and outs

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.040 
the ins and outs
it<00:01:58.180> uses<00:01:58.510> up<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.660> paper<00:01:59.310> and<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.780> even

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
it uses up the paper and that's even

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.370 
it uses up the paper and that's even
farther<00:02:02.440> away<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.910> did<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.300> three<00:02:04.600> times<00:02:04.900> and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
farther away so I did it three times and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.220 
farther away so I did it three times and
look<00:02:06.370> how<00:02:06.490> big<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.730> map<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.360> not<00:02:07.600> have<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> run

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
look how big that map is not have to run

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.950 
look how big that map is not have to run
around<00:02:08.260> and<00:02:08.710> fill<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.130> map<00:02:09.580> out<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.720> run

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
around and fill that map out as you run

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.930 
around and fill that map out as you run
forward<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.650> fills<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.850> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
forward it fills it in for you and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.540 
forward it fills it in for you and
