00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.560
 today enchased creative hearts of 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.829
 stone let's trace a heart in a 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.629
 cardboard or in a cardboard in half this 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.599
 is so that you will be much better 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.330
 heart I cut several hearts because 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.660
 I'm going to do several projects now with 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.039
 newspaper we put to the bottom this 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 it is so that we do not stain our table 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 of work 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.310
 we will also need paste the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.149
 Paste is very easy to make is a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.370
 cup of water for two cups of flour 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.780
 we stir very well and leave it to fire 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.210
 slow now we make little balls with a leaf 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.200
 of newspaper we are going to paste them 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.170
 on the cardboard 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.570
 with a tape like masking tape we go 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.780
 fixing the cardboard and one with the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 another let's do many until filling 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 all the heart 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.120
 now also in the base we are going to 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.770
 put a little bit of paste this is 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 so that when it dries it is very good 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.250
 glued 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.689
 since you have everything full your heart 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.329
 Now we are going to put pieces of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.230
 newspaper over first let's cut 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.420
 the newspaper in pieces 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.180
 not very large more or less the size of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 your palm or a little bit more 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.320
 everywhere with paste for all 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.350
 parts 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.350
 now stick it over the heart we 're going 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.320
 to do several times until covering everything 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.720
 the heart of pasteitos with no paste 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.630
 matter that you get very wet this goes 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.330
 to dry go around the edges 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.260
 so that it is perfectly covered 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.110
 all the heart of papers with the raw 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.810
 This will dry up and it will look 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.120
 a stone you'll see, let's leave it 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.350
 dry in the sun 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 and if you wait about 24 hours as it is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.260
 perfectly well dry we are going to paint 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.869
 the base black or any color 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.490
 dark this has an explanation 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.490
 you'll see the effect it will give 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 paints well everywhere and all 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140
 hollows of the dark color that you chose 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.319
 It can be black or chocolate or a red 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.330
 very dark now with a cardboard box 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 which can be shoes or any 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.940
 box we are going to have an idea for you 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 Czech heart that your heart goes well 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.000
 in the box before to work for you 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.090
 short cap for only 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.819
 the base is half painted white 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.590
 of the color you want do not paint it is very 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.870
 well that effect looks very father 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.730
 but you can also hang it with some 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.989
 paper but I like to see it 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.110
 graffiti 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.819
 vintage style as if it were old 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.730
 then do not paint it perfectly well 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.020
 it only covers more or less everywhere 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.420
 of the color of your preference 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.030
 we return to the hearts as it is 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.340
 well dry the black let's paint it from 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.460
 red or any other color removes the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 over color brush for 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.190
 that you also paint your heart 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.520
 Brush the brush well above your 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.470
 heart this is so that it is not painted 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.840
 perfectly everything as we did with 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.900
 the black but nothing else what is 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.100
 This is going to highlight a lot 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 wrinkles of your newspaper 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.340
 the idea is to look like stone that's 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.560
 do it everywhere and give your hands 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.230
 that you want to make it look a little 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.020
 more red however you do not paint it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.370
 perfectly that is let the color 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.370
 Black can reach to see 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.780
 winds also the shores very 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.769
 gently remember that the excess 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.359
 always from your red paint brush 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.269
 since I know you can give him another pass 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.010
 so that it is a little redder this is 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.469
 a smaller heart that was already a 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.930
 little painted but I want it to look 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.590
 more red so we're going to give you a 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.590
 second hand 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.820
 now to deliver our heart here 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.710
 there is the white box that we paint we are going to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.680
 put on the back glue 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.940
 white we expanded it very well and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.940
 we turn our heart 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.760
 now on another piece of cardboard well 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.310
 Half painted the same color as your box 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.770
 let's give a credit to whoever 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.020
 we are going to deliver this heart to me 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.730
 happened to give a warning to that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.190
 so special person that to receive the 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.370
 heart 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.520
 that does not break my heart or in case of 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 emergency that I'm going to put it but you 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.220

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.770

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.259
 it breaks even in case of emergency 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.830
 we put some silicon and stick it 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.740
 in a corner of your box this for the 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.099
 part of outside to get me out 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.860
 now if you are ready to surrender 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.389
 You can also use the other hearts 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.720

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.449

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.400

 You can also decorate your heart with 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.919
 pieces of decorated papers or paint it 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:37.120
 red in the base and only in the 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.850
 top part in gold 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.710
