stand<00:02:13.320> on<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> scales<00:02:13.800> yourself<00:02:14.250> write<00:02:14.610> down

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
stand on the scales yourself write down

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.670 
stand on the scales yourself write down
your<00:02:14.970> own<00:02:15.150> weight<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:15.810> pick<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.230> your<00:02:16.410> child

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and weigh yourself again subtract the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
and weigh yourself again subtract the
smaller<00:02:18.900> number<00:02:19.410> from<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> bigger<00:02:19.890> number

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
smaller number from the bigger number

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
calculate the right dose but that's only

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.140 
calculate the right dose but that's only
the<00:02:25.740> first<00:02:25.830> step<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.760> need<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> right

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the first step then you need the right

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.420 
the first step then you need the right
equipment<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:28.260> right<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.770> inside<00:02:29.250> the
