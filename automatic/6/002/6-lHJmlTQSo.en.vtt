00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.160 
see on the Lumia 900 this isn't
necessarily<00:01:01.159> a<00:01:01.339> bad<00:01:01.399> thing<00:01:01.579> because<00:01:02.170> Nokia's

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
necessarily a bad thing because Nokia's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.660

bit<00:01:04.940> because<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.990> all<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.290> these<00:01:06.530> changes<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
bit because of all of these changes the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.789 
bit because of all of these changes the
710<00:01:08.659> will<00:01:09.049> sell<00:01:09.409> for<00:01:09.590> about<00:01:11.439> 270<00:01:12.439> euros
