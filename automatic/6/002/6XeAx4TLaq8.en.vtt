very lightly and blend it into the skin
which<00:02:09.479> i<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:10.050> key<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.550> bronzer<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
which i think is key for bronzer in

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.590 
which i think is key for bronzer in
general<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> want<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.660> blended<00:02:13.080> but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
general you want it to be blended but

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.840 
general you want it to be blended but
especially<00:02:14.110> when<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.620> such<00:02:15.130> fair<00:02:15.460> skin

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
especially when you have such fair skin

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.810 
especially when you have such fair skin
I<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.690> reason<00:02:17.050> why<00:02:17.290> people<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.490> when

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820

I think the reason why people like when
my<00:02:18.940> skin<00:02:19.210> tone<00:02:19.390> are<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:19.720> afraid<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.170> bronzer<00:02:20.590> is

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
because they're going to think it looks

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.810 
because they're going to think it looks
like<00:02:22.600> too<00:02:22.930> much<00:02:23.140> product<00:02:23.500> or<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:23.980> too<00:02:24.370> dark
