00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
flak jacket the reason for that is

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.090 
flak jacket the reason for that is
because<00:01:01.629> I<00:01:01.809> want<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.020> run<00:01:02.170> dexterity<00:01:02.770> instead

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
because I want to run dexterity instead

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.340 
because I want to run dexterity instead
of<00:01:03.190> engineer<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.760> hate<00:01:03.969> dying<00:01:04.659> from<00:01:04.930> like

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
of engineer and I hate dying from like

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.500 
of engineer and I hate dying from like
bouncing<00:01:06.310> Betties<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.000> stuff<00:01:07.150> so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
bouncing Betties and all that stuff so

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.330 
bouncing Betties and all that stuff so
I'm<00:01:08.260> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.440> run<00:01:08.500> flak<00:01:08.770> jacket<00:01:09.190> for<00:01:09.310> that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
I'm going to run flak jacket for that

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.890 
I'm going to run flak jacket for that
toughness<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:10.150> there's<00:01:10.330> no<00:01:10.479> flinch<00:01:10.810> when

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
toughness so there's no flinch when

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.510 
toughness so there's no flinch when
we're<00:01:11.110> getting<00:01:11.200> shot<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:12.100> really<00:01:12.310> helpful

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
we're getting shot it's really helpful

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.550 
we're getting shot it's really helpful
for<00:01:12.640> rushing<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.330> staying<00:01:13.869> on<00:01:13.990> target<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
for rushing and staying on target and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.890 
for rushing and staying on target and
then<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.430> course<00:01:15.460> extreme<00:01:16.000> conditioning<00:01:16.540> and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
then of course extreme conditioning and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.960 
then of course extreme conditioning and
dexterity<00:01:17.439> dexterity<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:18.490> we<00:01:18.640> can<00:01:18.729> climb

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
dexterity dexterity so we can climb

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.440 
dexterity dexterity so we can climb
faster<00:01:19.540> but<00:01:19.780> more<00:01:19.930> importantly<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:20.500> we<00:01:20.619> can

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
faster but more importantly so we can

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.820 
faster but more importantly so we can
bring<00:01:22.450> up<00:01:22.570> her<00:01:22.689> gun<00:01:22.869> faster<00:01:23.380> like<00:01:23.560> when<00:01:23.710> we're

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
bring up her gun faster like when we're

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.649 
bring up her gun faster like when we're
sprinting<00:01:24.100> we're<00:01:24.430> gonna<00:01:24.520> shoot<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.030> lot<00:01:25.150> faster

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
sprinting we're gonna shoot a lot faster

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.960 
sprinting we're gonna shoot a lot faster
so<00:01:26.560> that's<00:01:26.680> also<00:01:26.950> hope<00:01:27.220> for<00:01:27.430> her<00:01:27.520> rushing<00:01:27.850> as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
so that's also hope for her rushing as

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.390 
so that's also hope for her rushing as

lightning<00:04:52.770> strike<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.190> they<00:04:53.280> really<00:04:53.460> nerve

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.230 
that thing so I don't like it anymore I
think<00:04:57.180> he'll<00:04:57.330> storms<00:04:57.660> probably<00:04:57.960> better<00:04:58.110> now

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
was so you start off the beginning of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.700 
was so you start off the beginning of
the<00:05:03.450> like<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.690> first<00:05:03.930> round<00:05:04.140> here<00:05:04.350> at<00:05:04.500> using

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
the like the first round here at using

like<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:08.160> ad<00:05:08.460> up<00:05:09.140> what<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.230> have<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.350> do<00:05:10.530> you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
like you ad up what you have to do you

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
like you ad up what you have to do you
have<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.770> switch<00:05:10.950> to<00:05:11.070> your<00:05:11.130> ghost<00:05:11.370> class

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
have to switch to your ghost class

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.720 
have to switch to your ghost class
before<00:05:11.850> that<00:05:12.180> round<00:05:12.390> starts<00:05:13.610> but<00:05:14.610> before

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
before that round starts but before

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.040 
before that round starts but before
another<00:05:14.970> call<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.330> duty's<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:15.690> we<00:05:15.810> could<00:05:15.960> do

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
another call of duty's what we could do

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.780 
another call of duty's what we could do
is<00:05:16.260> we<00:05:16.290> like<00:05:16.680> we'll<00:05:16.890> pick<00:05:17.070> this<00:05:17.220> class<00:05:17.490> and

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
is we like we'll pick this class and

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.010 
is we like we'll pick this class and
it'll<00:05:18.000> kind<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.210> sprint<00:05:18.479> forward<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:18.960> then

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
it'll kind of sprint forward and then

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.050 
it'll kind of sprint forward and then
the<00:05:19.140> enemy<00:05:19.380> will<00:05:19.470> call<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.740> UAV<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.310> then<00:05:20.970> we

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
the enemy will call it UAV and then we

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.340 
the enemy will call it UAV and then we
would<00:05:21.240> like<00:05:21.390> calling<00:05:21.720> our<00:05:21.810> ghost<00:05:22.050> or

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
would like calling our ghost or

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.780 
would like calling our ghost or
cold-blooded<00:05:22.830> class<00:05:23.010> or<00:05:23.250> whatever<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.610> keep

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
cold-blooded class or whatever to keep

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.780 
cold-blooded class or whatever to keep
off<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.139> UAV<00:05:25.139> but<00:05:26.070> now<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:26.250> guess<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:26.639> have<00:05:26.760> to

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
off the UAV but now I guess you have to

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.670 
off the UAV but now I guess you have to
switch<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:27.479> class<00:05:27.870> like<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.350> your<00:05:28.470> goals

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
switch to this class like to your goals

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.010 
switch to this class like to your goals
class<00:05:28.979> before<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.330> started<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.780> round

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
class before this you started that round

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.540 
class before this you started that round
otherwise<00:05:31.560> you're<00:05:31.919> gonna<00:05:31.979> show<00:05:32.280> up<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.490> the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
otherwise you're gonna show up on the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.540 
otherwise you're gonna show up on the
minimap<00:05:32.640> whatever<00:05:33.270> so<00:05:33.630> I'm<00:05:34.470> not<00:05:34.740> have<00:05:35.280> one

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
minimap whatever so I'm not have one

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.010 
minimap whatever so I'm not have one
hundred<00:05:36.000> percent<00:05:36.030> clarity<00:05:36.570> on<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.720> but

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
hundred percent clarity on that but

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.480 
hundred percent clarity on that but
that's<00:05:37.200> what<00:05:37.260> I've<00:05:37.440> been<00:05:37.500> hearing<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.919> lot<00:05:37.950> so

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.640 
that's what I've been hearing a lot so
