00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.950 
people see that sustainability is
marketable<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.130> that<00:05:36.910> there's<00:05:37.300> a<00:05:37.389> model<00:05:37.810> here

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960

that<00:05:38.169> works<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:38.710> another<00:05:39.010> club<00:05:39.310> then<00:05:39.639> I<00:05:39.850> think

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
that works for another club then I think

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.159

they would definitely adopt some of
these<00:05:41.350> features<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:42.160> think<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.610> it's

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
these features and I think that it's

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.590 
these features and I think that it's
going<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.389> attract<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:45.070> new<00:05:45.460> crowd<00:05:45.940> of<00:05:46.180> people

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
going to attract a new crowd of people

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:55.110 
going to attract a new crowd of people
