00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi friends at least call of duty thick 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.899
 It was already quite long ago, the less I 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.210
 just couldn't not make this movie in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 this year everyone was talking about opposition 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 series battlefield and call of duty 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 even releases of new games of these series 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 took place with a difference of a week what how 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 would hint 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.670
 but in reality everything is absolutely wrong 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 no competition between battlefield and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.320
 call of duty now seems to me already 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 just no of course before these two series 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.170
 competed and competed pretty 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 hard 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 but now in my opinion I think you 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.149
 agree with me 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 call of duty is no longer competitive 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 capable and released recently let it 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 fully proves 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 technical gap this series already 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 so huge that it looks 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.969
 some Polish shooters compared to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 giants like the battlefield can 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.379
 of course say that multiplayer tigers 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 completely different and in part it will be 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.100
 true but only but i'll feel too with 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.140
 the third part of the beginning of some attempts 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.390
 copy multiplayer from the call of series 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.489
 duty with local das matches of course it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.559
 it was crooked but in the fourth part it is already 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.270
 looks good and everything you can 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.530
 offer multiplayer call of duty with 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.850
 the same success you will be offered 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.229
 multiplayer battlefield 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.510
 only to this will be added 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 improved graphics and destructible pro 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 frustration with dogs you too all 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 for sure know them positioned as 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 such a super main feature of the game and in the end 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 they appear in just two story lines 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 missions and wave 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 single player campaign too nothing 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 nothing interesting has come down 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 to simple tere we shoot and watch 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.820
 the screensaver again we shoot about made 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 under the blueprint story points you already 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
 surely and without me know seen these 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.400
 videos and if you have not seen it right now 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.869
 you can see it in the background 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 Of course someone might think that this 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 there were references 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.700
 Or maybe it really was a reference. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 however and in general it does not matter in the end we 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 we have a new part of the call of duty series 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.420
 which is outdated both technically and morally 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.880
 and in 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.250
 it is not clear why there was such a hairdryer to do 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.259
 which nevertheless sold successfully and 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.450
 brought great profits of course all 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.430
 happened by inertia a famous series with 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.869
 things but i don't think what a ride 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 more than 1 time 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.229
 surely mainstream multiplayer 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.020
 this year's shooters becomes 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.030
 battlefield 4 want there aren't some 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.160
 Claim to the name that I 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.989
 stated in the previous video a link to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.690
 which or annotation will be around here somewhere 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.420
 the game is definitely cool and gets it 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.180
 the title is well deserved here in principle and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.310
 all i wanted to say is your opinion on 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.989
