00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.860
 movie the impossible the genre is 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.980
 movie is drama has suspense too 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.710
 it lasted almost two hours and was directed by 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.300
 juan antonio bayona the state ann and 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.790
 is based on a story of life 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 real about a family that travels to 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.870
 thailand to spend Christmas there and 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.239
 during this time you are 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.340
 trapped in one of the most tsunamis 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.920
 strong of our times that was the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.980
 of 2004 when the tsunami hits the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.110
 family is separated and is found by a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.000
 side the mom who is played by 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.659
 children equal and the eldest son is called 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.879
 lucas with the characters lucas and also 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.010
 on the other side is the dad who is 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.460
 played by ewan mcgregor and the two 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.379
 little children the mom who is called 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.479
 Mary this wound is fighting for 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.909
 survive good by your son's side 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.610
 Lucas and the two parties are trying 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.350
 be either alive or dead good 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.630
 now I'm going to tell you my opinion first 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.909
 I want to talk about the performances 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.469
 it seemed good performances that 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.610
 I think it was the best was the son's 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.920
 greater lucas 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.900
 I think it really transmits the pain 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.390
 and everything that is happening being a 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.700
 child and good now going to the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 production we have several data 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.850
 important one is a Spanish movie 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.070
 the producers and the directors are 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.979
 Spaniards in fact when the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.750
 movie they start to show you the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.540
 credits so to speak from the government 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 Valence Spanish cinema valència 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.010
 and several things and then the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.950
 movie is you see that the actors are 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.270
 hollywoodenses are speaking in English 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.090
 then a mixture and in fact then 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.060
 also the genre which is thriller 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.210
 it's a Hollywood genre and the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.940
 effects the effects are good are not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 nothing great but if you understand what 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.700
 what's going on 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.570
 also the makeup is good about 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.250
 everything in the wounds is a part where 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.800
 leo me watts have a short on the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.110
 leg and the truth if you give it to him 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.010
 they present super well you do very 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.900
 cruel but good 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.180
 and an interesting fact about this 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.760
 movie is that if it's based on a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.439
 real story but the original family 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.579
 It was not English but Spanish and like 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.430
 producers found out about this 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.739
 history was through the radio the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.079
 family was talking on the radio this 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.790
 interview and was telling his story 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.069
 and survival the producers what 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.409
 they listened and they were very interesting 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.629
 make a film of this theme and for 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.359
 other side too many of the extras 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.890
 that come out in the movie are 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.709
 survivors this is mine not that I 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.659
 it seems interesting good in general it 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.299
 he made me a good movie if I 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:03.139
 I recommend that they go see it is it is 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.629
 very emotional if you want to cry 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.659
 because the subject is suspense is a 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.900
 thriller because all the effects are 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.959
 intense no I do not think it's apt for 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.459
 little children but if they go to see her and 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.500
