00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 finally it is known on which with 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.470
 farmers will play in 2015 and the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 new cover are finished designed finally 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.929
 So now we are often up 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 the site of amazon here 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 there's the collectors once 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 special edition so the collector's 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 edition the special edition exclusively at 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.539
 Amazon and the starter edition 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.710
 All three have their own cover and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.090
 So I too one we go 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 Let's go to the collections 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 Let 's go through the collector's edition 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.809
 So that's exactly what they do 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.700
 only now in the video while 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 agricultural simulator people 15 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.500
 the mac with the first more than 100 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.969
 vehicles and accessories 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 Write over at the 2013 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
 40 licensed brands how much water 20 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.559
 Licensed goods were just earlier 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 13 earlier, 20 was now 140 licensed 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.030
 that means almost twice as much 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.500
 as already known in the old video is new 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.850
 holland also new 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.890
 this is actually like the extension 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.640
 profane for the agricultural simulator 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:11.670
 2011 exactly and there are still courses 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 This is a harvester manufacturer went 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.020
 me as well 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 constantly three species of animals like the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.229
 career mode with economics system what 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.259
 I can imagine myself under it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.119
 I do not breed so much and buy 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 Felder has always been like that and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.369
 quite important there is a Nordic 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 card now that's the new one 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.500
 map is so that's natural, of course 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.950
 like what you are under 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.840
 preparatory work is also logically Nordic 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.280
 There are many trees and that the new one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 agriculture minister failures 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 that means actually is even 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.570
 not so stupid 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.560
 are you right that's seven had 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.970
 they are playing with their own 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.290
 friends in multiplayer mode per lan 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 or internet is synonymous with the other 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.159
 beautiful 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.049
 we hope that lan means cable in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.219
 a pc cable in the other pc and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.259
 not always over the internet but me 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.030
 believe it would not be true anyway 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.170
 of course a revolution for the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.570
 Agriculture simulator 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.789
 Of course that would be great and wise 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.020
 Of course, there are still times 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.660
 Additional contents of the collector's edition 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.880
 a book farm simulator 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 modding for dummies therefore the hot ones like 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.700
 all so that there is synonymous with everyone 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 other thing that's over for dummies 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.130
 That's kind of always new 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 holland 8390 model tractor from siku 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.489
 So I doubt that one there 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.050
 victory for tugs but rather 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.670
 that the keychains so 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.190
 but meant is that I'm not 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.130
 Sure it seems to shit in seconds 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.019
 that 's not a high quality good 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.519
 what should a cost-risk tug 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.930
 It's not cheap either 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.950
 you what 100 euro for such a thing tin 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.840
 for the whole project that should be 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.010
 then maybe as expensive as it is 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.060
 are quite cheap for 97 and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.690
 keychains stickers are meant to be there 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.230
 his 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.480
 dvd modding tutorials so videos and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.769
 a dvd box so I assume there will 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.280
 everything is in there that the game is there 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:12.120
 probably 30 men and one a2 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.150
 poster with the map the cover in big 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.579
 points just like afro and the giants 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.829
 engine sdk 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.680
 he needed for a windows 8 7 or 8 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.780
 bit vista 7 or 8 pc 2 gigahertz intel 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.670
 and corresponding or equivalent 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.010
 processor a nvidia geforce 8600 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.130
 upwards so at least 512 ram 2 gb 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.359
 RAM'm probably times 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.950
 not behind and two megabytes free 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.299
 disk space so actually 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.130
 everything like the last or yes 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.570
 actually everything like the last marriage 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.810
 but they did last 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.780
 actually memory Baumann 2 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.709
 exactly 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.660
 I would say we actually have 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.040
 all the text here we have to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.150
 Do not necessarily read it to yourself now 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.959
 I make you some can ye 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.910
 read it yourself 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:05.970
 that's another banter of yes 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.859
 how great is it a typical promotional 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.170
 Plannings are indeed in every game 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.970
 Exactly collector's edition more accurate 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.930
 now you can finally see 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.799
 Again the logo really looks 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.060
 Of course, there is already the logo 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.340
 for the normal version 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.930
 yes I do not know if that already open 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.200
 Yes, I have exactly that is natural 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.600
 as always from usk 0 released so for 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.430
 soja you can let the baby play 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.250
 if you want that so I say goodbye 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.900
 Do not tell me at the tus and 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.970
 until next time wide news 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.340
 tomorrow probably looks at ours 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050
 two partner facebook pages over 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.730
 with whom we have a little in the future 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.060
 Working together is both 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.950
 just fine new information 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:58.790
 bring out once www.facebook.com 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:01.860
 slash 115 news and slash 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.700
 agriculture like agriculture 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.320
 simona tor - 2015 or looks exactly 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.320
 over until next time
