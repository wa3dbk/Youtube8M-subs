00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.280
 in my career is the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.260
 executive specialty and alejandro

 fields he is in food and drinks 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.790
 here in the ctp that pot but you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.040
 we observed in the previous note of the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.350
 interview we did with you there in 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.540
 from that date already classified for 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.050
 the chile tournament the truth is that a 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.510
 very large effort has not been easy 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.630
 too hard competitors too close 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.350
 the competition but thank god then 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.210
 the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.700
 fear after truth and continue 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.830
 forward to be able to classify and be 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.240
 always between the second and the first 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.860
 Market Stall 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.160
 in the four dates true 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.010
 very important to me this world cup has 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.180
 been a dream and thank God I'm going 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.800
 course with pilot and do it actually 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.020
 Alejandro what is the vor and work 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.810
 tell us a little for the people who 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.120
 suddenly you will be wondering how 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 is that what rules have what are the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.759
 characteristic conditions 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.860
 in what we say dust is how it is 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.610
 as a derivative of the south but also 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.229
 it has its many differences true as 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.969
 for example there the south 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.519
 go bar 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.009
 this one goes for one in the table has 

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:56.709
 change in the egg for one goes to bed 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.649
 and maneuvers are very different 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:02.469
 truth and in what is competition is a 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.989
 little resemblance are also marked 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.979
 priorities and interference equal 

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:11.079
 the same time 15 minutes for each hit 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.939
 truth in what is competition is a 

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:16.479
 little more similar but what is already 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:20.049
 pressure league and those things true yes 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.059
 is very different is you have got 17 

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:23.499
 years and with 17 years and his coach 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.929
 National'll represent Costa Rica 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:29.349
 in the euribor world then and what 

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:31.449
 message does to young people not that they 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.439
 really motivate because it is a is a 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.989
 too beautiful sport 11 as it goes 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.659
 progressing by grabbing you more love true 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:42.549
 and that they follow in the truth note that 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.319
 we motivate because maybe of 

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:46.869
 Suddenly many people are easy not to 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.939
 can and what or even the same 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:50.649
 dads and friends are going to tell you that 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.080
 that not only for marijuana and 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:55.509
 equines and what but that depends 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.789
 from one if one grabs the roads or not 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.159
 but but but still in the note 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.159
 really super motivated because the power and 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:06.030
 surfing is something very incredible is about 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.030
