investing TVs for the last 15 years and
I<00:02:26.550> spoken<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.830> greater<00:02:29.130> than<00:02:29.340> for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
I spoken to that it is greater than for

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.850 
I spoken to that it is greater than for
the<00:02:29.640> 6<00:02:29.850> inch<00:02:30.090> LCD<00:02:30.660> entertaining<00:02:31.230> people<00:02:31.380> max<00:02:31.739> a

the 6 inch LCD entertaining people max a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
the 6 inch LCD entertaining people max a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
lot of science the highest

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.080 
lot of science the highest
so<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.170> standard<00:02:35.830> definition<00:02:36.400> looks<00:02:36.640> quite

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so so standard definition looks quite

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.300 
so so standard definition looks quite
noisy<00:02:37.270> on<00:02:37.660> an<00:02:37.780> alc<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.769> reason<00:02:39.129> or<00:02:39.280> cite

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
noisy on an alc be the reason or cite

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.979 
noisy on an alc be the reason or cite
standard<00:02:39.730> definition<00:02:40.239> come<00:02:40.420> from<00:02:40.569> analogue

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
standard definition come from analogue

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.140 
standard definition come from analogue
background<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> definition<00:02:43.000> is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
background and because the definition is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.000 
background and because the definition is
lower<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.750> english<00:02:44.349> definition<00:02:44.500> is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
lower and the english definition is

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.360 
lower and the english definition is
greater<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.230> same<00:02:47.440> reason<00:02:47.830> why<00:02:48.099> when

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
greater this is the same reason why when

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.160 
greater this is the same reason why when
you<00:02:48.400> stream<00:02:48.790> some<00:02:49.060> videos<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.900> looks<00:02:50.080> very

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
you stream some videos and it looks very

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.440 
you stream some videos and it looks very

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
mainly because for high-definition the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.650 
mainly because for high-definition the

months in high definition it is still

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.870 
months in high definition it is still
relatively<00:04:55.560> cheap<00:04:56.069> and<00:04:56.220> anything<00:04:56.610> if<00:04:56.759> you
