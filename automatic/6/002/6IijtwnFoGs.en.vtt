not<00:00:53.250> thinking<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.650> which

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
not thinking about it all you know which

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.990 
not thinking about it all you know which
I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.130> some<00:00:56.309> point<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> lead

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I think at some point is going to lead

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
I think at some point is going to lead
me<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> abject<00:00:57.870> poverty<00:00:58.290> why<00:00:59.130> do<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> silly

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
me to abject poverty why do you silly

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.770 
me to abject poverty why do you silly
reference<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:02.180> well<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.690> if

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
reference at you well first of all if

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.230 
reference at you well first of all if
it's<00:01:03.900> sort<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.260> real<00:01:04.440> economy<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.130> don't<00:01:05.339> since

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's sort of real economy we don't since

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.680 
it's sort of real economy we don't since
the<00:01:06.450> label<00:01:06.810> doesn't<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.910> act<00:01:08.910> like<00:01:09.330> most

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
the label doesn't actually act like most

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.870 
the label doesn't actually act like most
labels<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.070> bothered<00:01:11.640> by<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
labels and we're not bothered by the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.100 
labels and we're not bothered by the
kind<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:13.520> structure<00:01:14.520> than<00:01:14.670> most

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
kind of structure than most

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.210 
kind of structure than most
entertainment<00:01:16.110> labels<00:01:16.560> used<00:01:16.830> which<00:01:17.100> is

entertainment labels used which is

entertainment labels used which is
largely<00:01:18.050> legally<00:01:19.050> based<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> lot<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
largely legally based like a lot of

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800 
largely legally based like a lot of
copper<00:01:20.070> itself<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> contracts<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
copper itself we don't have contracts we

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.370 
copper itself we don't have contracts we
don't<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.050> lawyers<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:23.640> don't<00:01:24.020> hire<00:01:25.020> out

take<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.310> mess<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:30.960> simple

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
take in all the mess it's very simple

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
take in all the mess it's very simple
like<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.610> therefore<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:33.420> know

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
like what we do so therefore we know

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.540 
like what we do so therefore we know
what<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.170> real<00:01:34.350> time<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.399> we

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
what the real time you is like what we

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.680 
what the real time you is like what we
spend<00:01:35.940> on<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:37.229> project<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.509> we

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
spend on a project and then how much we

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.940 
spend on a project and then how much we
can<00:01:39.840> solve<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.649> money<00:01:40.800> back

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
can solve for to make that money back

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.070 
can solve for to make that money back
and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.430> make<00:01:41.759> enough<00:01:41.970> money<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
and then make enough money for the

just<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.400> evil<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.300> art<00:02:22.450> music<00:02:22.930> industry<00:02:23.470> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
just as evil as the art music industry I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.130 
just as evil as the art music industry I
suppose<00:02:24.730> that's<00:02:24.940> why<00:02:25.090> I've<00:02:25.270> always<00:02:25.569> try<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.959> do

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
suppose that's why I've always try to do

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.890 
suppose that's why I've always try to do
things<00:02:26.290> myself<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.569> mean<00:02:28.870> it's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
things myself and it's I mean it's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960 
things myself and it's I mean it's
really<00:02:29.260> hard<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.650> do<00:02:29.770> because<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.160> costs<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.850> lot

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
really hard to do because it costs a lot

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.060 
really hard to do because it costs a lot
of<00:02:31.090> money<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.220> try<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.250> live<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.030> life<00:02:34.480> is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
of money and so I try to live my life is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.229 
of money and so I try to live my life is
inexpensively<00:02:36.070> as<00:02:36.280> possible<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.150> can

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
inexpensively as possible so that I can

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.080 
inexpensively as possible so that I can
actually<00:02:37.510> save<00:02:38.050> money<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.519> know<00:02:39.610> publish

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
actually save money to you know publish

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.710 
actually save money to you know publish
my<00:02:40.269> own<00:02:40.390> books<00:02:40.660> or<00:02:40.959> my<00:02:41.890> own<00:02:42.010> postcards<00:02:42.700> or<00:02:42.910> or

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
my own books or my own postcards or or

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.860 
my own books or my own postcards or or
whatever

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.420 

so<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> think<00:02:51.109> it<00:02:51.260> from<00:02:51.499> from<00:02:52.069> our<00:02:52.189> point<00:02:52.340> of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so I think it from from our point of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.739 
so I think it from from our point of
view<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.879> one<00:02:52.999> hand<00:02:53.030> it's<00:02:53.389> based<00:02:53.599> on<00:02:53.689> a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:53.749 
view on the one hand it's based on a

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.660 
view on the one hand it's based on a
real<00:02:53.930> economy<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.799> second<00:02:55.129> half<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.579> that

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
real economy the second half of that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.750 
real economy the second half of that
equation<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.629> it<00:02:56.749> i<00:02:56.959> buy<00:02:57.650> records<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.670> I'd

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
equation is it i buy records and I'd

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280 
equation is it i buy records and I'd
rather<00:02:58.909> buy<00:02:59.150> record<00:02:59.450> with<00:02:59.540> ten<00:02:59.689> dollars<00:03:00.049> and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
rather buy record with ten dollars and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.959 
rather buy record with ten dollars and
fifteen<00:03:01.010> dollars<00:03:01.340> what<00:03:01.670> do<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.790> think<00:03:01.939> of

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
fifteen dollars what do you think of

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.979 
fifteen dollars what do you think of
Napster<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:03.040> think<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.159> benefits<00:03:04.870> artists<00:03:05.870> on

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
Napster I think it benefits artists on

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.990 
Napster I think it benefits artists on
small<00:03:06.290> smaller<00:03:06.739> level<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.340> maybe<00:03:07.639> not<00:03:07.879> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
small smaller level and maybe not the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.119 
small smaller level and maybe not the
ones<00:03:08.180> who<00:03:08.329> are<00:03:08.450> already<00:03:08.540> millionaires<00:03:09.129> that's

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
ones who are already millionaires that's

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.789 
ones who are already millionaires that's
good<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.090> mean<00:03:11.540> hey<00:03:12.019> I'd<00:03:12.319> well<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.650> think

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
good but I mean hey I'd well I think

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:13.929 
good but I mean hey I'd well I think
that<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.159> people<00:03:13.280> who<00:03:13.519> aren't<00:03:13.700> millionaires

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
that the people who aren't millionaires

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.459 
that the people who aren't millionaires
deserve<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.689> benefit<00:03:15.019> more<00:03:15.139> than<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.349> people

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
deserve to benefit more than the people

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.659 
deserve to benefit more than the people
who<00:03:15.650> are<00:03:15.889> is<00:03:16.459> about<00:03:16.760> them<00:03:17.689> so<00:03:18.249> this<00:03:19.249> many

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
who are is about them so this many

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.789 
who are is about them so this many
schools<00:03:19.999> of<00:03:20.150> thought<00:03:20.389> and<00:03:20.689> people<00:03:21.590> really

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
schools of thought and people really

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.640 
schools of thought and people really
start<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.189> stand<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.609> and<00:03:22.639> vocal<00:03:23.569> about<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
start to stand up and vocal about it the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.259 
start to stand up and vocal about it the
one<00:03:24.829> saying<00:03:25.099> look<00:03:25.340> you'd<00:03:25.549> only<00:03:25.700> helps<00:03:26.060> promote

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
one saying look you'd only helps promote

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.149 
one saying look you'd only helps promote
you<00:03:26.569> in<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> blood<00:03:27.319> but<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.560> think<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.010> this

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
you in the blood but I think that this

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.339 
you in the blood but I think that this
whole<00:03:28.879> huge<00:03:29.269> school<00:03:29.659> of<00:03:29.689> thought<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:29.989> just

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
whole huge school of thought that just

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.649 
whole huge school of thought that just
think<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.680> they<00:03:30.829> dumb<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:32.329> shouldn't<00:03:32.629> have

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
think that they dumb you shouldn't have

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.439 
think that they dumb you shouldn't have
to<00:03:32.870> pay<00:03:33.019> for<00:03:33.049> music<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.730> think<00:03:35.150> that's

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
to pay for music and I think that's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.069 
to pay for music and I think that's
bullshit<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.430> as<00:03:37.549> bandwidth<00:03:38.060> increases<00:03:38.419> and

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
bullshit and as bandwidth increases and

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.589 
bullshit and as bandwidth increases and
we<00:03:39.530> can<00:03:39.680> get<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:40.489> know<00:03:40.579> CD<00:03:40.879> quality<00:03:41.120> digital

as fast as we get mp3 s then it's been
the<00:03:47.750> crucial<00:03:48.019> issue<00:03:48.139> is<00:03:48.349> going<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.590> be

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
the crucial issue is going to be

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.899 
the crucial issue is going to be
figuring<00:03:49.189> out<00:03:49.250> how<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.340> compensate<00:03:49.730> people

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
figuring out how to compensate people

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.539 
figuring out how to compensate people
fairly<00:03:50.359> for<00:03:50.750> their<00:03:50.870> art<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.650> cutting<00:03:52.430> out

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
the middleman who really have no purpose

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.159 
the middleman who really have no purpose
anymore<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:55.189> had<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:55.970> publish<00:03:56.299> my<00:03:56.479> own<00:03:56.599> stuff<00:03:56.870> so
