 cutis reach 30 requires a change of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.420
 beauty habits to preserve a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 luminous skin linda betancourt 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320

 the skin during that third decade 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.110
 welcome to glenda and good tell us 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.720
 I'm the one I think the most 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.750
 important to the skin is there is no 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.430
 makeup but hydration itself is very 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.350
 important hydration in our 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.570
 complexion but it is also important that 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.970
 we have to take several steps to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.670
 we can moisturize the skin we have to 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.890
 always have a daily routine all 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260
 the days that it is something sacred to remove not 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 is the makeup daily and so 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.280
 we can use the creams that are 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.159
 moisturizing but do not think heavier 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.340
 for a woman of 30 years declared 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.740
 the 30 years because at 15 18 20 the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.780
 visits many times it costs me not to 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.750
 Remove the makeup for days 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.630
 that is wrong we always have to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.429
 have him very aware every day 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.229
 remove us the makeup because because 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.910
 we are eliminating at the moment 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.550
 we remove the makeup we will remove 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.590
 the toxins and the impurities that we have 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.770
 about our skin and so we can start 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.210
 with a healthy hydration 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.600
 every day good how many times at 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.729
 For example, a month is recommended 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.710
 exfoliation for example good a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.049
 exfoliation we recommend it at least 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 twice a week is very important 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.509
 So you're going to keep your skin healthy 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.390
 look with a natural color and so you go 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.039
 to help close the pores a bit 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.959
 they are too open it is good 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.100
 exfoliate always twice a week 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:08.170
 with boiling hot water that is 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.509
 that there is steam to open those pores 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 first before you can clean them or not 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.560
 but you need to buy 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.450
 any product a product that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 you can find in any store or 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.319
 in any center , discuss it for 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 that then you put it on your face and you 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.180
 you are expanding it and that's how it is not very 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.519
 good that you do it with warm water you take 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 your towel you dry them very delicately 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.130
 How do you have to treat your face and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.690
 cleaning and you will get creams or serums 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.420
 you both have to use the serum 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.120
 it also helps you hydrate it is like 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 you are having serum dribbling serum into your 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.590
 face water on your face so that you 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.020
 metal helps and hydration are the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.960
 creams between lighter of your stool 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.840
 best by the age of 20 years now 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.360
 cute at that age do not need 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.310
 much makeup when a young girl 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.010
 time 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.260
 is healthy is young does not have 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.630
 spots do not have wrinkles do not need 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.900
 makeup however some if you 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.260
 put in that sense is that you think that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.260
 it is better to wear a washed and clean face 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.000
 and take her a little makeup in that 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.480
 sense can take a little 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.370
 made up but not exaggerating between 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.590
 more have your makeup look your 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.530
 natural makeup and have a concealer 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.110
 and a natural base will show off your skin 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.720
 younger and a more natural makeup and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.069
 so juvenile and at bedtime 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.720
 a lot is talked about not the creams to the 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.520
 time to sleep and other people think that 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.739
 good as the head in the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.980
 pillow and take everything I like 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.700
 no no not always before reclining 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.190
 go to sleep 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.380
 you have to make-up remover even if you get 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.780
 tired the last thing you have to be is 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.459
 remember you good now is I'm 20 years old 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.600

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.750
 a daily routine as if in the day and in 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.030
 the night to remove makeup 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.709
 you are eliminating all the impurities of 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.300
 the skin because you are using a 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.489
 makeup all day and you're going to 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.010
 lay down with the same makeup or 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.989

 an age of 30 or more 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.260
 has obviously asked to shield those 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.040
 anti-aging creams that you 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.870
 you mention to be recommended that the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.240
 begin to use them between 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.520
 young girls alone and later on to go to 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.500
