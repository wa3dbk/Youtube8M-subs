 a unique and complete normative set

 with the international rights pact 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.890
 civilians and politicians but in the context 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.780
 of the cold war it was not possible a 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.000
 agreement between the eastern blocks and the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.400
 west the rights became a 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.079
 Toy political interests the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.940
 rights of the first dimension as

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.459
 problematic for governments 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.349
 authoritarians of the eastern bloc 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.260
 that's why they preferred to defend in the debate 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.500
 human rights known as dsc 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.389
 of the second dimension partly as 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.579
 reaction of rejection and partly by 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.290
 conviction the western bloc will 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.670

 as a consequence, the tse 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.959
 they were largely relegated to a 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.140
 background compared to the

 that the rights of the first dimension 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.250
 they were considered to be claimable before 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.380
 sc courts were understood 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.280
 fundamentally as objectives for whose

 However, work should be carried out 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.030
 since the end of the cold war it 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.690
 they are making intense efforts 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.500
 to legally equate those of sc to
