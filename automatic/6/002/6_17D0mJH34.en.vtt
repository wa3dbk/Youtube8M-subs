00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.420
 so friends or simon here 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.150
 enjoy the beautiful weather the better 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.560
 is therefore super weather today 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.380
 a very exciting topic for me 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.110
 you see it on my t-shirt today 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.570
 especially about role models 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.369
 wrong role models in our sport 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.220
 not only in the sporty little bow 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.290
 and rightly so my tip to the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.090
 right models maybe short 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:43.040
 tony montana scarface we all know 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.609
 is evil person is a criminal 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.800
 nevertheless a certain fascination 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.170
 a fascination of many take 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.699
 in fact, as an example 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.559
 I also had a fascination 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.489
 That's why I had the t-shirt 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.070
 on top of that, there are people who 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.660
 we might find that we might as well 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.820
 what we do not do 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.060
 should and that is extremely ours 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.040
 sport so you know it all the big ones 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.290
 People I really are not names 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.400
 but so call the real professionals the 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.920
 mister olympias of the last years know 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.150
 all that's not natural we are 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.509
 everybody knows that there is a lot 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.079
 was helped with 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.400
 We will be the most diverse means 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.630
 then to make a special video 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.040
 What is there at all, believe me 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 that's not just steroids that's too 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.119
 really growth hormones all over 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.680
 harmful things we know that the 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.810
 not natural we know that we are 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.979
 because never get there one thinks of the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.640
 time when she started to 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.070
 work out 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.939
 there were not all those big boys 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.460
 your role models 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.869
 he did not know them as our 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.060
 model because she was not with me 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.210
 maybe Jean Claude Van Damme 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.729
 why leave that pay when you choose 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.380
 the look there we are partly then 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.140
 Also about it from that of the muscles 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 and at some point you continue training 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.570
 and the role models are different 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.370
 just keep on going up 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.610
 because honestly you can find that 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.180
 as fascinating as my type on 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.160
 the t-shirt 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.430
 we think it's fascinating but we are 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.140
 honestly want to look like this 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.340
 Do you have the boys in salacious 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 or does he have the boys in the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.890
 seen offseason if that really 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.080
 are huge if the 130 140 kilo vienna 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.940
 that looks very bizarre to me 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.520
 believe someone who does not do the sport 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.220
 and he does not know it that way 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.680
 he does not like that, that's easy 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.480
 not natural and you can see that too 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 I think we should get the boys 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.380
 not as an example take my tip 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 what are you really looking for? 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.130
 want is always looks back would be on 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.320
 At the beginning of the new model we too 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 Many have started 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.880
 Achieve real progress and are 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.170
 Nevertheless, always dissatisfied with hers 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.330
 body I also have my diplomat 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 that means the further you go 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.050
 The more dissatisfied it is because 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.120
 goals or role models even higher 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.280
 and the discrepancy between the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.800
 where you are now or where you are now 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.930
 and the goal more and more apart 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.760
 Gone therefore step back who was 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 your example really sets you up 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.530
 real role models sets you role models 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.330
 which you can reach take you 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.950
 which guys where you god give thanks 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.049
 it is so in the natural bodybuilding scene 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 really good role models that too 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.370
 I could reach natural as well 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.000
 Do not call too many names but believe 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.010
 a tim fork mallon a nasa angelo 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.110
 believe the guys that you can still 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.670
 reach that is still possible 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.079
 Of course you might not 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.340
 come right there because the open super 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.840
 genetics because that's really a lot 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.000
 train because so you too 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.829
 earn a living but sets 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540
 you there so your goals puts me there like that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.950
 her role models that's my tip 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.959
 Look where he started looking 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.280
 really what you're right already 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.500
 my program is so that you 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.630
 really upload a picture of yours 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.400
 start shows you over and over again 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.900
 where you came from will lose their 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.980
 just the overview you see 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.079
 just not what we progress 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.209
 you have always received your goal 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.640
 in front of which you have put yourselves 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.000
 now that does not stay too high of course 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.100
 that's my conclusion of the whole 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.480
 said it is fascinating to look at it 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.620
 you like that especially now 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.900
 soon on the fibo again 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.640
 I also like watching 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.370
 But we should not use it as our goal 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.370
