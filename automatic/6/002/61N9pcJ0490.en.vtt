00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.760
 yes 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.760
 and 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.290
 all right 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.880
 it is higher more until you connect with it 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.720
 look 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 I'm a master analyst 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.370
 the list work at school 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.590
 moderate school movement that I founded 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 let's make the need for talented children 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.640
 many children who are dancers want 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.340
 dance and want to make a company 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 in the background, what I offer you is 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.240
 perform the artistic dance company 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 who are dedicated to work modern dance 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.100
 and contemporary from a perspective 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.220
 of art is usually when the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 talent is early and here are the children 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.570
 every time you see them play them 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.350
 they are dancing if you put music on them 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.680
 they dance and dance absolutely accessed 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.270
 totally from the environment they 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.409
 project through movement and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 music 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.080
 of existence the environment 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 every time you take them to a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.310
 show to them the attention 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.310
 moving in dance 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.260
 they are very motivated to listen to me so 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.640
 dance they ask you with music and you see that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.040
 the child immediately you put the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 music and start dancing but not to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.229
 dance looking in a mirror but to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.960
 dancing alone the other is that the child has 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.440
 the soft bones that are very ductile 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.209
 Have soft feet rings 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.399
 he wants the hands that are left behind or 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.700
 be you are seeing it hyperlaxity is 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.670
 body and it's already a way let's say 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.800
 to see that the boy has conditions 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.250
 of talent to develop this 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 activity 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.909
 now 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.909
 at 23 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.470
 3. 4 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.300
 the point starts with the teacher 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.970
 physical education teacher the teacher 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.650
 of music will always detect the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 skills and talents of children 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.900
 at an early age and to guide parents 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.270
 towards the schools that are dedicated to this 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.520
 There are many schools that are engaged 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.170
 dance professionally and there are other 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.900
 that we are dedicated to the case of mine that I 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.870
 I dedicate myself to doing recreational classes and 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.480
 train professionals or within the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.220
 child's school structure they come 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.020
 what he does and one develops them the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.240
 talent and virtue to become 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.230
 professional dancer once they graduate 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.300
 from the middle 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.610
 when I was a boy at school there was 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.610
 a little bit of gauze 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.790
 asian 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.220
 It was always moving, it does not matter how 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.880
 he wants to call me yes because he was very tender 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 so 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:46.370
 another music that will be like a cycle that 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.830
 have this when girl got better as 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.200
 a workshop and like that from there little by little I 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.050
 started to like and I keep getting and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.640
 I found this school is a sensation 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.910
 that he did not feel in another place like that 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.160
 it is not another is something as integral as 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.800
 complete that gives you dance that at 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.620
 final is a vice as a vice 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.000
 very very good because apart from having the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.040
 mind is this agility be a delicate 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.220
 that movement that does not make another type 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.310
 of death that makes me like it 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.120
 much 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:27.820
 and it's always a little more artist in a 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.830
 thing but still try to correct it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.350
 in quotes because I always have a 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.529
 super traditional family and we are having 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.309
 hand man good very active auto logy 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.739
 and then I'll wait like I 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:44.079
 follow the same path as it is 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:45.789
 fundamental my family supports me 100% 

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:47.469
 of what I want or if it is that I 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.049
 I want to be a dancer they are going to 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.729
 support a lot very much and even them 

00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:54.369
 they are like those that motivate me or even 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.669
 come as they like a lot this 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:05:00.819
 like my dad are super germanians are 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.399
 artists but they really like this 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.839
 I like every presentation every trip 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.749
 if they have the possibility 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:10.089
 companion accompany me and they are me 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:13.269
 those that motivate me to continue here and 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:15.560
 at the end like it becomes something more 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:18.350
 cute family 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.750
 then there when you see that the child 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.750
 really have the need to dance 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.360
 you have to carry your laundry and spend a lot 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.780
 with little children that dads do not take them 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.280
 the children also arrive to them 16 17 18 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.040
 years when they are big 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.200
 however association u2 inserts it into 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.320
 a dance school has a world 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.720
 open of possibilities and they truncate 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.410
 because he came in too late then the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.600
 problem that we have that children are 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.440
 connected with the art to use after 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.820
 15 years old and that's late and the problem 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.849
 it's not in the children but we have 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.129
 parents 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.559
 it is important that the parents of the time 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.939
 the activity because if they want 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.490
 develop this activity a 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:06.209
 visibility and a discipline you need 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.649
 time and time of dad I ask him to 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:10.409
 parents who give their children time 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:13.080
 children who worry that if the child 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.539
 has an artistic ability that 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.860
 they have the time to develop it because 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:23.369
 a pianist a dancer takes 12 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.889
 14 years to get to be a great 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:29.159
 dancer to become a champion and sta 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.469
 it is not an activity of how time is 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.749
 an activity that requires thousands of 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.219
 hours needed many hours of the 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:39.599
 week and many hours the ends of 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:43.819
 Work week of body work in 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.819
 the case of dance with their lives
