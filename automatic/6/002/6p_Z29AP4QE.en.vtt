00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello to all and it's all morgane 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.210
 and so I find you for a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 new small series that will consist of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 present you the croo pta raid in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.100
 solo and so with this point of view 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 third person that I find quite 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 nice gift for that just join 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.580
 the part is so here I do with my 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.769
 poto cei you've already seen on others 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.199
 videos and so is I I am the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.460
 director of the shot on the spot the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.840
 red card in a game we have this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 nice point of view me perso I had 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 I really like 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.739
 you will tell me what you think but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.020
 I planned to offer you all 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 gameplay that way I find that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 rather original and I like this point 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 of third person view so there we are 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 with a hunter of course it's true that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.890
 it's the simplest class for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.780
 go through this momentum step even though 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.489
 it is feasible with others but 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.340
 it's true that with all these 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.050
 invisibility in doctrine swordsmen that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 helps a lot 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.649
 so the lamps 1 you know it takes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.550
 pass by to activate them once 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.020
 that they are activated after one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.370
 some time she explodes so they 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 can kill the enemies you go the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.040
 see at work in this excerpt so 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.920
 countries as I told you who 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 so uses all these possibilities to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 pass a void you go the little ones the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.330
 station do not worry there was 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.790
 a few small lakes it may be 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750
 because precisely I joined short 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 so the under countries and who can spend 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 invisible when he starts to khroubie who 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 can go invisible like there when he 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.790
 gives a blow to an enemy and who can 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.229
 go invisible with his super so 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.369
 of course you have to sort it out it's not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.229
 it's not necessarily because you 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.400
 pass since you have all that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.200
 go see in the doctrines for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.180
 choose the right things but you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.700
 go a lot of invisibility sources 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.420
 and that's pretty fun 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 greatly things 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.390
 you know you have a disability 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.149
 when you are outside of the lamps 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.229
 is to prevent you from jumping and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.060
 run in what is the weight of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 darkness up to x 10 when you stay 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 next to a lamp admits oxen 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.000
 you will be able to regain your 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.229
 jumping and running abilities which 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.790
 gives an advantage since we will be able to 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.040
 jump on the tongue simply 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.420
 it's one of the little tricks when 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.219
 we are hunters what will allow us 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.049
 to iron revisit like there you go 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.640
 see him var attention for example you 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.840
 did you see it was limited in the lamp 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.610
 was ready to explode 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 you still have to be careful not to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750
 stay too long at times background 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.269
 limit you will not have time to spend 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 on the slow but too bad it's 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.660
 really a plus in addition if you 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.700
 have time to get on this 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.129
 famous lamp of course still 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.080
 equip you in case if you have 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.599
 some enemies to face the time 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.060
 that your ability to give a shot of 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.280
 knife that makes invisible reactivates 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.140
 that's not it we did not necessarily all 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.670
 the time so there he had the great 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 mower if I'm not mistaken who is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.299
 that explodes like the damage 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.000
 pressure is rather practical seen 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.950
 how are the slaves massed and 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.870
 rather lucky also because 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.640
 its invisibility it happens quite often 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.170
 I often have the problem of my 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.130
 invisibility that not pass as he 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.500
 you have to do it but it's just you 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 have seen the enemies explode and there 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.370
 simply of practice I think that's it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.440
 dads is the invisibility of the blow 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.940
 they continue unfortunately good reason to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.180
 final this step this first step 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.590
 is really simple enough as a hunter 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 the limits simpler than if there were 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.390
 other people of course and so is there one 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.129
 normally happens is going to be a horse 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.180
 is there if I'm wrong I know more 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.760
 if it's at this stage where it's 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.790
 maybe right after so you can 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.440
 of course you have to know samson its duration 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 of invisibility info know his 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.709
 character so I hope that's okay 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.090
 complain these little solo extracts this 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.380
 which will allow you to do it solo 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.670
 if you found anyone more 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.290
 I saw horse on the right 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.690
 so we have a knight already at this 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.359
 step so the cei are hiding a little 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.069
 little and it goes as it is above 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.790
 normally if everything goes well if he 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.010
 there is no bug 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.480
 the knight will not jump on him 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.370
 has already had some pretty exceptional things 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.109
 in this part hard she me I 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.870
 already had trolls finally eat the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.400
 calls and passed on his ogres who 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.109
 was all the time above the map and 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.239
 who we who are and do not go 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.329
 down on it was ogres 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.130
 superman it's pretty awesome 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.000
 German dawn I found the enemies 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.160
 pretty buggy on on the dream so to see 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.530
 if what made you do it the same 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.849
 thing but hey we still do it 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.380
 it's not bugs that prevents 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.549
 succeed like that could be the case on 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.739
 was it when he was not doing the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.049
 teleports or things like that or 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.450
 when ian buck when we pass the portal 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.890
 it is not there so there makes it 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.370
 reached I told you huh it's for 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.900
 they just 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.550
 world can run next and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.740
 chain the second language this lamp 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.990
 there is a little further it is enough 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.669
 complicated it'll be the least complicated 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.550
 and then we come to the formation of the 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.199
 bridge so it will have to be debated before 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.139
 to go on the rock in front we see 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.240
 behind it so especially jumped on 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.479
 this lamp because there is need of this 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.979
 little timing to iron invisible and 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.500
 there normally our classes and not 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.419
 on the active room platform is safe 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.750
 since this rock it's pretty simple to 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.919
 manage 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.380
 so you'll see the enemies 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.810
 explode xevo season stolen goods 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.699
 besides and so is there we use the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.590
 visibility of course we have already done 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.660
 without it having succeeded its rise on the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.160
 rock because of course it may not 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.780
 pass one if you have not been enough 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
 oxen and even of course you go 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.340
 play on invisibility in any 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.930
 this small space there around the 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.940
 activation platform and hope that 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.860
 it activates quickly enough the advantage of being 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.870
 on this little rock compared to if 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.780
 you were on the ground it's you go 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.440
 to be able to see the ogres arrive 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.729
 normally he sees where they see you 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.380
 not necessarily you have seen the enemies 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.240
 a bit of trouble to spot that there is 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.160
 someone and suddenly they are approaching 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.660
 not too much but here we will have the others 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.520
 sailboats the blow that form see the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.410
 ogres coming from the bottom of the map 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.970
 and suddenly there is plenty of time to 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.220
 the snipers so of course icebreaker 1 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.740
 par excellence for would be of a good 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.960
 black hammer is and practical but if 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.160
 you have already made their hate but the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.900
 icebreaker still has a big 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.099
 advantage over a black hammer ogre that 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.240
 works very well since you have for 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.669
 chain one of the precision guys and 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.870
 to lose two cartridges since I 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.550
 remind you that black hammer if you 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.080
 you launch chesnais 3d guette precision 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.180
 you automatically recharge 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.979
 you can also use that if you 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.270
 have already added it if not icebreaker 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.560
 so I hope that besides he 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.870
 will come back to dior there are a lot of 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.860
 people who is waiting for him who was not there when 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.539
 he was available 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.720
 we could see the bridge is formed by itself 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.930
 it's quite simple and leveaux form 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.430
 and not so much a little bit anyway 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.520
 and now there are more than up to 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.580
 the light all the way down there and that's 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.810
 a first step 2 succeeds so 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.039
 pleasure and you're not 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.630
 too much chasing through the enemies would 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.130
 xive or chain it without playing on a 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.930
 visibility is another story 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.430
 could see it in the extract I 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.909
 you have proposed precisely in the guide 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.430
 classic 6-player raid and that's it 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.620
 was not the same thing 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.510
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.340
 we find ourselves very quickly for the 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.410
 second step is following this raid 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.830
 solo and of course by then for full 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.830
 other videos
