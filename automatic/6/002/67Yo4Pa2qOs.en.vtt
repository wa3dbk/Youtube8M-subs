00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.770
 good afternoon, dear viewers 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.860
 maybe night or evening i don't know but 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.400
 it is absolutely not important with you molting with 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.120
 This is the second part of my transfer for noobs 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.859
 about how not to play in tanks 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:24.560
 today I will show you the battle on the tank e100 and 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.970
 you all look at him well I have everything 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.970
 in view of all two of my viewers 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.920
 surely this her friend knows here 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.390
 still watched the first video 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.330
 click fight now see where she is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.900
 threw 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.680
 monasteries are excellent so have an opponent 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:55.940
 just 10 and 5 7 yagdtigr lorraine with us 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:59.720
 except me 7 and mx pozh 30 object 704 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.180
 basically equal teams by force a lot 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 art is very sad but since we 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.600
 super mega cool tank e-100 great 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.080
 armor great gun pretty accurate 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.940
 crazy breakthrough crazy damage 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.430
 so we fear absolutely nothing 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.330
 we are not even going to like that there I am 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.140
 pass and we'll just go will tear everyone 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.040
 as a hot-water needle needles starts fine 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.810
 forward well 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.790
 we are not looking for such as 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.100
 heavy here or just drive straight 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.320
 right and kill everyone because of us 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.399
 just nobody broke 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.399
 and we all tear 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.350
 I really hope that I get right away 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 7 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.540
 10 and the tiger is happy to make out 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.080
 I'm going alone because well why do I need someone 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.380
 she told me just him 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.530
 on him I will tear all yellow no washed 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940
 rival 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.940
 I would love to destroy him 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 Be sure to knock down a tree so that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.330
 show what 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.330
 stupid me so cool powerful tank 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.200
 and so that while nobody is visible we see 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.110
 everyone got scared and you my homie 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.380
 we're going to cry right to the base 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.350
 so moment 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.760
 so there back there would be nothing on him 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 attention to all sorts will 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.390
 after there they fight with others, it's a pity there 1 of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.390
 7 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.740
 So 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.460
 no one is visible yet 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.390
 I'll drink coffee while the sound is necessary 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.390
 and here are those 30 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.080
 the pine themselves said well, not bad 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.100
 1000 slapped 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.400
 who is his country 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.400
 score 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.440
 divide longer 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.190
 but also any search or 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.620
 Bolivia 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.090
 here they are and houses on 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.410
 not bad 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.410
 trying to remember archer 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.650
 Yes 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.880
 but strictly speaking, all battles 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.510
 run out 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.510
 me usually 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.530
 yes in fact in this fight it was possible 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.990
 would bring a lot of benefits to the team 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.660
 but noobs do exactly how they are simple and 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.430
 go do whatever horrible trying 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 to destroy 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.250
 everyone who gets caught without thinking 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.250
 team benefits 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.930
 Well, let's not look at this shame 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.930
 although we will surely win for now 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.740
 window on this we 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.490
 will stop 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.490
 good morning to all
