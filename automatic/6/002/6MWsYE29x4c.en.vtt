00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi my name is ulyana or led and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.750
 today it's time to do what we 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.179
 waited so long to talk it in Ukraine 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120
 know your rebellious veronica mouth or 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.799
 film insurgent i hope that i am now 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 since in some kind of fox because 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 that the camera today you are naughty but i 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.890
 just for a second did 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.410
 a small pause to again this fact 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.590
 already March 20 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 how did March 20 come so fast 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 just yesterday I thought about what 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.700
 example insurgent three more weeks and these 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 three weeks flew literally as a couple 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 hours brew on what I tell you 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 today about in insurgency i will also share 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.180
 Opinion departed in other films which 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 looked recently 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 This Cinderella is a New Cinderella Adaptation Movie 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 and also about the movie the beautiful creature 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 who recommended me to one of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.399
 my last videos if u properties 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.910
 video selling vampire academy and city 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 bones 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 the first living thing of course I will start it 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.850
 veronica mouth and insurgent immediately tell 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 that film caused me pretty mixed 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 feelings still after watching the first 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.719
 teaser trailer of and just coaches i 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 understood that the film will not appear at all 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.299
 what I thought he would be if 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 it can be so generally said because 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.159
 there were so many such super duper 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.710
 fabulous parts with litany everyones 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.409
 glasses with suspended tris and so on 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 when i was reading a book i was submitting it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 the film version is completely different 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 First of all, the film insurgent became towels 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 and robert's work to me some very 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 like he shot one of my most 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 favorite movies and flight videos and beyond 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.700
 this share worked on the adaptation 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.700
 comic book over the film of the year 2013 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.500
 out of the tap argument or ghostly 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 patrol there is a seam in Russian 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.649
 was called a very funny movie without looking 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.450
 on the fact that he is quite low 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.729
 ratings of what's on film search what is on their 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 money and he teased very much 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.810
 excellent time in the cinema when 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.689
 watched it if we talk about the incident 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.460
 I really enjoyed it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.950
 all these effects, I still decided 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.240
 watched a movie in 3d who say what 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.189
 the film is extremely free 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.110
 interpretations of the book and in some way 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.210
 my like this because I love 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.450
 when the director has his some 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.130
 a clear look at the events of the book and he 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.630
 somehow interprets them differently 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.880
 rather than the author seems to me it is pretty 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.010
 It is interesting to compare as with the first part 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.110
 I perceived the book adaptation 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 apart from the books themselves did not hold 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.920
 some bright and clear parallels 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 the most vivid impressions for 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.090
 me from this movie have become just the same 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.040
 these effects and acting all these 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.470
 experiences that portrayed for yourself 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.020
 Shailene Woodley seemed to me, in principle, 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.490
 quite adequately executed 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.680
 the only thing I really don't like 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.120
 This hairstyle in this film was only 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.520
 one moment when really 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.250
 liked the short hair on the keys 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.470
 in one of the worst moments for 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 hairstyles width became the moment when 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.940
 almost the end of the film she is lying in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.930
 bed and talking to calla you and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.570
 my goodness how even linguud will start shaking 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.610
 says she destroyed the whole faction 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.540
 my mind immediately thought of and all 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.520
 hairdressers 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 I also liked it in some way 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.750
 acting game and evil albert in this 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 case, he straight all of himself so super 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.000
 the sufferer was also the absolute favorite in 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 whole movie became miles teller 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.950
 his sarcastic this which is like in a book 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.440
 I really like the fact that he was 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.750
 sarcastic so in the movie this one is fine 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.790
 it was sarcastically transmitted that moment 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.239
 Peter we see extremely rarely as and Kate 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.190
 winslet 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.110
 their acting robbery and liked hit 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.400
 I'm so super harsh apparently so far 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.450
 can not forgive myself drowned 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.790
 Leonardo DiCaprio 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 I also liked the movie appearance 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.760
 naomi watts I think she's great 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.739
 looks in the role that she 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.170
 but performed by this pirated and 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.820
 strange costumes surprised me in some places 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.769
 If we talk in general and a movie 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.140
 but it seems to me it turned out peculiar 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.150
 credit action if at all possible 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.340
 say because he's not as good as 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.650
 first film but sometimes even 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.480
 better than the first movie I thought 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.519
 really looking forward to these next two terrible 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.700
 parts of which will have to wait two more 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.950
 years because I am for those who ask 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.069
 I say favor I hope that they will not change 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.069
 the ending i don't 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.980
 I see sense to change the ending because 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.200
 I think she was in some way 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.150
 logical and very unusual for styles and 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.069
 genres in general on the blade if you already 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.209
 looked and for this shared with 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.310
 me your opinion in the comments 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.620
 write will you go to this movie 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.750
 do you want to watch the following movies 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.820
 watched this series in general or read it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.800
 and what is your opinion just let's not 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.360
 spoilers friends in the comments well i 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.979
 while moving on to the next cartoon 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.570
 who wanted to talk in this movie 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.139
 the next movie I would like 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.300
 mention this new screen version of Cinderella 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.099
 absolutely chic fabulous movie film 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.139
 which I recommend you see what 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.910
 you just fill yourself good 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.280
 I really liked the mood 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.970
 the adaptation is pretty funny picked up 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.669
 the actors 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.330
 stunning yourself in the landscape and here are the places 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.490
 where they filmed 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.370
 if anything, I was very surprised that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.320
 they live prince and king practically in 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.419
 Dresden art gallery corrected 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.490
 their creator reminded me so much of it 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.900
 it was fun to live and and perhaps one of 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.669
 those things radicals really worth 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.550
 go to this movie this costumes 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.570
 Cinderella These Layered Puffy Skirts Me 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.940
 I immediately wanted to participate 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.560
 some kind of costume ball or 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.990
 so black where i could too something 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.360
 so wearing it seems to me very 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.430
 interesting and I honestly had neither 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.139
 the slightest notion of a fairy tale in tea editorial 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.490
 will be filmed and I am very 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.289
 I liked the fact that it is all the same to the people 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.509
 brothers make-up their sheer finger 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.430
 clutch of the Cinderella sisters because it 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.650
 it would be absolutely not pleasant and 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.720
 suitable rotation case and 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.759
 otherwise I recommend everyone to go to Cinderella 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.860
 now let's talk about the beautiful 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.050
 making beautiful movie making 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.940
 which came out and if I 'm not mistaken 2013 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.800
 year in the fact that I remember exactly that I am very 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.659
 I wanted to go to him, but sometimes it was 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.389
 vietnam and he is somehow literally riding 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.500
 we went to the cinema then 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.750
 beautiful creations this is that movie 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.180
 which again immerses us in the little 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.490
 town in a small town all man 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.830
 some strange hermit has a boyfriend 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.210
 and to the school where this guy is studying 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.400
 girl comes if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.740
 this old man's collar niece and 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.529
 all sorts of magical events take place 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.559
 because the case 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.599
 usually not the easiest for me 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.339
 I liked that wine honestly here 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.019
 interesting shot in the spirit just the same 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.569
 vampire academy camera work 

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:17.359
 I think it was done all sorts of knitting needles 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.549
 fixes are interesting cast and on 

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:22.039
 my mind is quite an intriguing end i 

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:24.139
