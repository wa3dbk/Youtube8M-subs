opening handed one Hawk but I mean at
the<00:02:05.159> same<00:02:05.310> time<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.579> was

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the same time that was

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.389 
the same time that was
a<00:02:06.690> really<00:02:07.080> good<00:02:07.170> pic<00:02:07.410> yeah<00:02:07.440> all<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.160> green

a really good pic yeah all the green
impact<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.300> yeah<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.020> naturalize<00:02:10.560> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
impact is really yeah but naturalize is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.460 
impact is really yeah but naturalize is
just<00:02:11.040> concretely<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.240> good<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.570> most<00:02:13.110> all

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
just concretely really good in most all

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930 
just concretely really good in most all
scenarios<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.340> don't<00:02:14.430> really<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.820> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
scenarios like we don't really have to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.790 
scenarios like we don't really have to
worry<00:02:15.090> about<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.660> angelic<00:02:15.990> edict<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.620> this

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
artifacts a decent bit especially I can

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
artifacts a decent bit especially I can
sole<00:02:27.180> artifact<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> turn<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.260> report<00:02:28.650> a

foggy or something like that
mmm<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.630> would<00:02:31.380> say<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.940> net-caster<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:34.110> would

mmm I would say like net-caster I would

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.910 
mmm I would say like net-caster I would
probably<00:02:35.100> look<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:35.750> razor<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:36.960> Britain<00:02:37.800> or

probably look at razor or Britain or

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
probably look at razor or Britain or

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
just because there's barely any weight

gonna see like alright well there's not
really<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.560> much<00:02:46.800> white<00:02:47.070> going<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.430> right

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
really that much white going on right

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.850 
really that much white going on right
here<00:02:47.640> hmm

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
here hmm

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.710 
here hmm
so<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.950> anything<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.910> might<00:02:51.270> make<00:02:51.510> me<00:02:51.540> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
so if anything like that might make me a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.940 
so if anything like that might make me a
little<00:02:51.810> bit<00:02:51.900> more<00:02:52.050> inclined<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> grab<00:02:52.740> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
little bit more inclined to grab the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.530 
little bit more inclined to grab the
razor<00:02:53.459> flick<00:02:53.700> directly<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.390> same

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
razor flick directly but at the same

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.560 
razor flick directly but at the same
time<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.020> reach<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.610> fact<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.420> it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
time I like reach and the fact that it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.270 
time I like reach and the fact that it
gets<00:02:57.630> plus<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.050> plus<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.770> top<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
gets plus two plus so on top of the to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.860 
gets plus two plus so on top of the to
three<00:02:59.489> body<00:02:59.670> yeah<00:03:00.030> that's<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.690> better

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
three body yeah that's one of the better

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.750 
three body yeah that's one of the better
spires<00:03:01.350> they've<00:03:01.620> made<00:03:01.890> for<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> horse<00:03:02.550> at<00:03:02.730> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
spires they've made for the horse at a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.580 
spires they've made for the horse at a
long<00:03:03.030> time<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.690> think<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.989> can<00:03:04.110> agree<00:03:04.350> this

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
long time so I think we can agree this

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.350 
long time so I think we can agree this
one's<00:03:04.800> first<00:03:05.040> definitely<00:03:05.670> alright<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> yeah

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
one's first definitely alright so yeah

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.970 
one's first definitely alright so yeah
from<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:09.989> thicker<00:03:10.230> razor<00:03:10.530> foot

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
from here it's thicker razor foot

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.040 
from here it's thicker razor foot
probably<00:03:11.940> razors<00:03:12.300> would<00:03:12.480> would<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
probably razors would would you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.530 
probably razors would would you
the<00:03:13.620> ramping<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.100> good<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the ramping is good but I like the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020 
the ramping is good but I like the
evasion<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.110> card<00:03:16.320> Flyers<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.519> evasion

evasion on that card Flyers and evasion

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
evasion on that card Flyers and evasion
in<00:03:19.190> m15<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.310> really<00:03:20.880> great<00:03:21.120> yeah<00:03:22.670> hammerhead

in m15 are really great yeah hammerhead
it's<00:03:23.820> pretty<00:03:24.030> alright<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:24.570> like<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.959> filler

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
it's pretty alright it's like a filler

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.560 
it's pretty alright it's like a filler
card<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.040> worser<00:03:26.340> than<00:03:26.370> anything<00:03:26.940> snaps<00:03:27.330> are

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
card and worser than anything snaps are

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.240 
card and worser than anything snaps are
the<00:03:27.959> interesting<00:03:28.290> thing<00:03:28.470> about<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.799> pack<00:03:29.070> is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the interesting thing about this pack is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.620 
the interesting thing about this pack is
that<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> creatures<00:03:29.820> really<00:03:30.030> aren't<00:03:30.239> strong

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that the creatures really aren't strong

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.259 
that the creatures really aren't strong
strongest<00:03:31.200> cards<00:03:31.530> are<00:03:31.620> actually<00:03:32.269> probably

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
strongest cards are actually probably

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.990 
strongest cards are actually probably
hammerhand<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.110> general<00:03:34.709> thirst<00:03:34.980> yeah<00:03:35.340> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
hammerhand and general thirst yeah so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.020 
hammerhand and general thirst yeah so
because<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> bag<00:03:37.080> has<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> lack<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.030> decent

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
because the bag has a lack of decent

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.330 
because the bag has a lack of decent
creatures<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.709> inclined<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.040> go

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
creatures in it I'm more inclined to go

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.620 
creatures in it I'm more inclined to go
for<00:03:41.580> one<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.700> these<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:41.970> gentlemen's<00:03:42.450> to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
for one of these in gentlemen's to

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.360 
for one of these in gentlemen's to
basically<00:03:43.160> make<00:03:44.160> something

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
basically make something

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.339 
basically make something
I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.120> turtle<00:03:46.300> there's<00:03:46.660> more<00:03:47.080> than

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
I think the turtle there's more than

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.680 
I think the turtle there's more than
anything<00:03:47.709> yeah<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:48.879> just<00:03:49.090> like<00:03:49.330> kind

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
anything yeah it's it's just like kind

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.210 
anything yeah it's it's just like kind
of<00:03:49.780> kind<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.680> two<00:03:50.800> pores<00:03:51.069> over

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
of kind of like you have two pores over

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.750 
of kind of like you have two pores over
but<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.730> doesn't<00:03:52.000> have<00:03:52.150> like<00:03:52.420> flying<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
but it doesn't have like flying or the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.790 
but it doesn't have like flying or the
plus<00:03:54.760> one<00:03:54.970> plus<00:03:55.150> one<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.200> actual<00:03:56.560> base

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
plus one plus one to the actual base

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.830 
plus one plus one to the actual base
power<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:58.209> at<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> same<00:03:58.510> time<00:03:58.660> whatever

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
power but at the same time whatever

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.380 
power but at the same time whatever
iPhones<00:03:59.200> creature<00:03:59.920> dies<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.849> get<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.030> plus<00:04:01.239> one

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
iPhones creature dies you get a plus one

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.910 
iPhones creature dies you get a plus one
plus<00:04:01.510> one<00:04:01.599> counter<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.470> bad<00:04:02.680> but

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
plus one counter so that's not bad but

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.130 
plus one counter so that's not bad but
like<00:04:03.129> wife<00:04:03.370> Lincoln<00:04:03.730> limited<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.330> just<00:04:04.750> my

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
like wife Lincoln limited is just my

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.780 
like wife Lincoln limited is just my
favorite<00:04:05.349> stack<00:04:05.739> abilities<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.459> there<00:04:06.610> is

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
favorite stack abilities that there is

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.780 
favorite stack abilities that there is
so<00:04:07.209> Journal<00:04:07.810> thirst<00:04:07.989> is<00:04:08.140> usually<00:04:08.739> no<00:04:09.430> it's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
so Journal thirst is usually no it's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.490 
so Journal thirst is usually no it's

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
removal I it was the other one like the

burning<00:04:58.060> rust<00:04:58.720> whatever<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.350> is<00:04:59.470> good<00:05:00.039> that<00:05:00.070> I

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
burning rust whatever it is good that I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.740 
burning rust whatever it is good that I
don't<00:05:00.820> remember<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.330> name<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.660> it

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
don't remember what the name of it

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.070 
don't remember what the name of it
actually<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:04.330> yeah<00:05:04.419> I<00:05:04.450> would<00:05:04.840> probably

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
actually is but yeah I would probably

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.690 
actually is but yeah I would probably
have<00:05:05.229> to<00:05:05.410> say<00:05:05.560> lurk<00:05:05.680> job<00:05:05.860> my<00:05:06.070> house<00:05:06.280> right<00:05:06.490> here

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
have to say lurk job my house right here

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.110 
have to say lurk job my house right here
so<00:05:07.650> yeah<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.680> think<00:05:08.950> that's<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.669> about<00:05:09.880> fair

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
so yeah I think that's it's about fair

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.089 
so yeah I think that's it's about fair
for<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.539> top<00:05:10.720> five<00:05:11.020> out<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.410> here<00:05:11.740> yeah

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
for like a top five out of here yeah

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.100 
for like a top five out of here yeah
anything<00:05:12.490> else<00:05:12.669> really<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.389> guess<00:05:13.570> naturalize

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
anything else really I guess naturalize

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.379 
anything else really I guess naturalize
not<00:05:14.410> really<00:05:14.560> just<00:05:14.740> just<00:05:15.130> naturalized<00:05:15.760> it's

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
not really just just naturalized it's

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.420 
not really just just naturalized it's
out<00:05:16.479> there<00:05:16.750> travel<00:05:17.440> wise<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.800> cool<00:05:18.039> if<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.280> can

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
out there travel wise is cool if you can

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.430 
out there travel wise is cool if you can
cohesively<00:05:18.970> manage<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.990> draft<00:05:20.229> something

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
cohesively manage to draft something
