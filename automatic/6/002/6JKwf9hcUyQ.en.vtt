now<00:00:00.390> let's<00:00:00.659> take<00:00:00.810> up<00:00:00.989> four-note<00:00:01.500> chords<00:00:01.920> we've

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
now let's take up four-note chords we've

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.400 
now let's take up four-note chords we've
covered<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.120> three<00:00:03.389> note<00:00:03.570> chords<00:00:04.020> major

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
covered the three note chords major

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.700 
covered the three note chords major
minor<00:00:05.220> diminished<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.240> augmented<00:00:06.560> now<00:00:07.560> we're

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
minor diminished and augmented now we're

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.860 
minor diminished and augmented now we're
going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> add<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> fourth<00:00:08.460> note<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
going to add a fourth note to some of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.020 
going to add a fourth note to some of
those<00:00:09.990> chords<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.309> we're<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> end<00:00:11.910> up

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
those chords and we're going to end up

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.390 
those chords and we're going to end up
with<00:00:12.210> six<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.750> sevenths<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.410> major<00:00:13.830> sevenths

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
with six and sevenths and major sevenths

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
with six and sevenths and major sevenths
and<00:00:14.519> minor<00:00:15.299> seventh<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.049> diminished<00:00:16.680> seventh

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and minor seventh and diminished seventh

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.029 
and minor seventh and diminished seventh
and<00:00:17.250> augmented<00:00:18.000> sevenths<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.529> let's<00:00:19.800> just

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and augmented sevenths and so let's just

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
and augmented sevenths and so let's just
see<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.490> they're<00:00:20.609> made<00:00:20.820> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
see what they're made of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.300 
see what they're made of
we<00:00:21.689> started<00:00:22.050> by<00:00:22.230> learning<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> major

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we started by learning that a major

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.570 
we started by learning that a major
chord<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> major<00:00:24.900> scale<00:00:25.580> from

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
chord is made out of a major scale from

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
chord is made out of a major scale from
the<00:00:26.670> word<00:00:26.849> La<00:00:27.180> Scala<00:00:27.570> which<00:00:27.750> means<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> ladder

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the word La Scala which means the ladder

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
the word La Scala which means the ladder
of<00:00:28.800> notes<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.580> take<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> root<00:00:30.150> third

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of notes and if we take the root third

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
of notes and if we take the root third
and<00:00:30.539> fifth<00:00:30.750> degrees<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> scale<00:00:31.769> that's<00:00:32.610> a

and fifth degrees of the scale that's a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.060 
and fifth degrees of the scale that's a
major<00:00:33.030> triad<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> major<00:00:34.079> three<00:00:34.500> note<00:00:34.710> chord

major triad a major three note chord

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670 
major triad a major three note chord
triad<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.910> course<00:00:36.120> means<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.530> can

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
triad of course means three so we can

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400 
triad of course means three so we can
make<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.270> quartel<00:00:39.270> chord<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> four<00:00:40.110> note<00:00:40.290> chord

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
make a quartel chord a four note chord

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.450 
make a quartel chord a four note chord
by<00:00:41.190> adding<00:00:41.730> another<00:00:42.420> note<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> scale<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
by adding another note of the scale and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
by adding another note of the scale and
if<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.670> add<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> six<00:00:45.270> degree<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> scale<00:00:45.840> one

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
if I add the six degree of the scale one

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
if I add the six degree of the scale one
two<00:00:46.469> three<00:00:46.739> four<00:00:46.920> five<00:00:47.250> six

s called c6 that particular quarter so

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
s called c6 that particular quarter so
called<00:00:51.510> c6<00:00:52.079> right<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:52.980> taking<00:00:53.129> the

this would be G six because I'm planning

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the sixth note of the scale notice the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.490 
the sixth note of the scale notice the
six<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> whole<00:01:08.790> step<00:01:09.150> above<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> fifth<00:01:10.080> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
six is a whole step above the fifth it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.490 
six is a whole step above the fifth it's
never<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> half<00:01:10.950> step<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> whole<00:01:11.400> school

never a half step the whole school
there's<00:01:13.500> D<00:01:13.830> six<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.580> I'm<00:01:14.729> adding<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
there's D six because I'm adding the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
there's D six because I'm adding the
sixth<00:01:15.799> scale<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> there's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.659> six<00:01:19.140> because

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sixth scale to it there's a six because

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.859 
sixth scale to it there's a six because
I'm<00:01:20.490> heading<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> 6th<00:01:21.330> note<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> East

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I'm heading the 6th note of the East

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
I'm heading the 6th note of the East
scale<00:01:22.140> notice<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.799> playing<00:01:23.189> C<00:01:23.490> natural

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
scale notice I'm not playing C natural

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.420 
scale notice I'm not playing C natural
why<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.259> e<00:01:25.290> scale<00:01:25.799> doesn't<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.250> like

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
why because the e scale doesn't go like

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.859 
why because the e scale doesn't go like
that<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> goes<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.659> three

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that it goes like this one two three

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
that it goes like this one two three
four<00:01:28.200> five<00:01:28.530> six<00:01:28.860> seven<00:01:29.189> eight<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
four five six seven eight so that's the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.569 
four five six seven eight so that's the
six<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> add<00:01:31.590> six<00:01:32.009> degree<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> scale

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
six in the add six degree of the scale

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.109 
six in the add six degree of the scale
to<00:01:32.729> e

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to e

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
to e
and<00:01:33.329> that's<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.170> six<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.150> remember<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.390> we

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and that's a six and remember what we

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.120 
and that's a six and remember what we
learned<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.780> inversions<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.619> any<00:01:37.799> court

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
learned about inversions at any court

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.819 
learned about inversions at any court
can<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.460> turned<00:01:38.729> upside<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.180> right<00:01:39.829> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
can be turned upside down right so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
can be turned upside down right so
that's<00:01:41.070> those<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:41.970> six<00:01:42.600> even<00:01:43.140> though

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's those are all six even though

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
that's those are all six even though
they're<00:01:43.380> upside<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.710> okay<00:01:44.390> let's<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.540> we've

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they're upside down okay let's see we've

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.950 
they're upside down okay let's see we've
covered<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.170> 16-6<00:01:46.829> d6k<00:01:47.670> 6<00:01:48.180> seconds<00:01:48.450> family<00:01:48.720> card

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
covered a 16-6 d6k 6 seconds family card

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.469 
covered a 16-6 d6k 6 seconds family card
here's<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> eight<00:01:49.829> major<00:01:50.040> chord<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.850> six

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
here's the eight major chord the six

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
here's the eight major chord the six
would<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.020> sixth<00:01:52.350> note<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> scale<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
would be the sixth note of the scale so

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.929 
would be the sixth note of the scale so
that<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> six<00:01:54.329> D<00:01:55.259> flat<00:01:55.790> six<00:01:57.829> flat<00:01:58.939> six

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that would be a six D flat six flat six

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.789 
that would be a six D flat six flat six
almost

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
almost

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:10.779

the<00:02:01.100> fit<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:02.149> flat<00:02:04.119> 6j<00:02:05.119> flat<00:02:05.590> sex<00:02:08.470> b6<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.890> B

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the fit it flat 6j flat sex b6 and B

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.550 
the fit it flat 6j flat sex b6 and B
flat<00:02:11.319> 6<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:14.180> if<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.629> add<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> 6<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.349> major

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
flat 6 now if we can add a 6 to a major

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.380 
flat 6 now if we can add a 6 to a major
chord<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.519> did<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.849> can<00:02:16.970> also<00:02:17.120> add

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
chord like we just did we can also add

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.759 
chord like we just did we can also add
it<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.629> minor<00:02:17.870> chord<00:02:18.110> can't<00:02:18.410> we

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
it to a minor chord can't we

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.089 
it to a minor chord can't we
and<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.849> that's<00:02:20.150> C<00:02:20.450> minor<00:02:20.780> 6<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.680> played

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
and so that's C minor 6 we just played

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.770 
and so that's C minor 6 we just played
the<00:02:22.250> minor<00:02:22.459> chord<00:02:22.849> but<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.150> had<00:02:23.299> at<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.540> same

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the minor chord but we had at the same

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.570 
the minor chord but we had at the same
note<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.200> 6<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.280> that's<00:02:25.400> C<00:02:25.700> minor<00:02:25.970> 6<00:02:26.390> minor<00:02:27.580> 6

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
note the 6 so that's C minor 6 minor 6

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.979 
note the 6 so that's C minor 6 minor 6
minor<00:02:29.500> 6<00:02:30.640> day<00:02:31.640> later<00:02:31.970> 6e<00:02:32.840> or<00:02:33.709> later<00:02:33.920> 6a<00:02:34.790> minus<00:02:35.450> 6

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
minor 6 day later 6e or later 6a minus 6

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.720 
minor 6 day later 6e or later 6a minus 6
that's<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.470> don't<00:02:37.040> take<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.280> time<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.489> go

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that's on don't take the time to go

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.830 
that's on don't take the time to go
through<00:02:37.940> all<00:02:38.060> those<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.540> get<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> idea

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
through all those but you get the idea

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.690 
through all those but you get the idea
you<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.319> play<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> blender<00:02:39.980> triad<00:02:40.340> whatever

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
you just play the blender triad whatever

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.009 
you just play the blender triad whatever
it<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.060> add<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.329> 6th<00:02:41.630> degree<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
it is and add the 6th degree of the

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.050 
it is and add the 6th degree of the
scale<00:02:43.000> now<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.060> could<00:02:44.480> if<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:46.280> added<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.610> 6<00:02:46.880> to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
scale now you could if you added a 6 to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.300 
scale now you could if you added a 6 to
an<00:02:47.180> Augmented<00:02:47.720> chord<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.620> Augmented<00:02:49.099> try

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
an Augmented chord and the Augmented try

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.309 
an Augmented chord and the Augmented try
it<00:02:50.269> would<00:02:50.390> sound<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.930> there's<00:02:51.140> really

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
it would sound like that there's really

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.229 
it would sound like that there's really
not<00:02:51.500> much<00:02:51.709> use<00:02:51.950> for<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.220> sort<00:02:52.760> well<00:02:53.060> it's

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
not much use for that sort well it's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.089 
not much use for that sort well it's
theoretically<00:02:53.810> possible<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.829> have<00:02:54.980> an

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
theoretically possible to have an

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.160 
theoretically possible to have an
Augmented<00:02:55.579> 6<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.480> know<00:02:56.569> it's<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.780> not

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
Augmented 6 it you know it's just not

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.550 
Augmented 6 it you know it's just not
useful<00:02:57.380> okay<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.079> you<00:03:00.079> don't<00:03:00.260> even<00:03:00.440> need<00:03:00.500> to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
useful okay so you don't even need to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.250 
useful okay so you don't even need to
learn<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:01.819> not<00:03:02.000> usable<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:03.019> you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
learn that it's just not usable if you

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.490 
learn that it's just not usable if you
add<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> 6<00:03:03.920> hover<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> diminished<00:03:05.030> triad<00:03:05.500> this

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
add a 6 hover to a diminished triad this

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.170 
add a 6 hover to a diminished triad this
is<00:03:06.650> kind<00:03:06.859> of<00:03:06.920> problematic<00:03:07.430> because<00:03:07.730> it's<00:03:08.030> not

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
is kind of problematic because it's not

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.069 
is kind of problematic because it's not
called<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.630> 6

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
called a 6

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.819 
called a 6
it's<00:03:09.290> called<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:10.780> diminished<00:03:11.780> 7th<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.440> what

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
it's called a a diminished 7th and what

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.129 
it's called a a diminished 7th and what
it<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.910> 7th<00:03:14.299> degree<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.690> scale<00:03:14.840> is

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
it is is the 7th degree of the scale is

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.050 
it is is the 7th degree of the scale is
being<00:03:15.380> double<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:16.700> kind<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:16.940> have

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
being double and you just kind of have

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.420 
being double and you just kind of have
to<00:03:17.120> take<00:03:17.359> that<00:03:17.510> by<00:03:17.720> faith<00:03:18.049> for<00:03:18.859> now<00:03:19.040> if<00:03:19.250> you're

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
to take that by faith for now if you're

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.849 
to take that by faith for now if you're
interested<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.060> going<00:03:20.810> into<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.200> more<00:03:21.739> in

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
interested in going into that more in

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.460 
interested in going into that more in
detail<00:03:21.889> you<00:03:22.459> can<00:03:22.750> follow<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.139> some<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.350> my

just<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.810> diminished<00:03:27.230> 7th<00:03:27.500> chords<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:27.950> how

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
just on diminished 7th chords and how

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.710 
just on diminished 7th chords and how
they<00:03:28.220> work<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:28.730> on<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:29.359> anyway<00:03:29.510> just

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
they work and so on but anyway just

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.870 
they work and so on but anyway just
learned<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.410> if<00:03:30.650> we<00:03:30.799> had<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.099> 6<00:03:31.400> note<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.790> it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
learned that if we had a 6 note to it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.370 
learned that if we had a 6 note to it
diminished<00:03:32.269> 7th<00:03:32.569> chord<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.930> know<00:03:33.049> we<00:03:33.230> don't

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
diminished 7th chord you know we don't

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.680 
diminished 7th chord you know we don't
have<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.709> 6<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.160> kind<00:03:34.819> of<00:03:34.880> call<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.239> 7<00:03:35.540> a

have a 6 you kind of call it a 7 a

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
diminished 7th chord ok now let's go on

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.099 
diminished 7th chord ok now let's go on
to<00:03:38.420> 7th<00:03:38.900> chords<00:03:40.209> there's<00:03:41.209> two<00:03:41.359> kinds<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.750> 7th

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
to 7th chords there's two kinds of 7th

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.690 
to 7th chords there's two kinds of 7th
chords<00:03:42.440> there's<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.859> courts<00:03:43.340> called<00:03:43.549> AB

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
chords there's a courts called AB

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.909 
chords there's a courts called AB
dominant<00:03:44.180> 7th<00:03:44.540> which<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.079> always<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.620> flat

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
dominant 7th which is always the flat

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.949 
dominant 7th which is always the flat
7th<00:03:46.400> through<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.819> school<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.329> there's<00:03:47.900> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
7th through the school and there's a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.360 
7th through the school and there's a
major<00:03:48.290> 7th

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
major 7th

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.089 
major 7th
okay<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:50.900> called<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.319> major<00:03:51.500> seventh<00:03:52.040> chord

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
okay it's called a major seventh chord

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.610 
okay it's called a major seventh chord
because<00:03:52.610> it<00:03:52.760> uses<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.300> major<00:03:53.629> seventh<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.410> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
because it uses the major seventh of the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.800 
because it uses the major seventh of the
scale<00:03:54.890> one<00:03:55.190> two<00:03:55.370> three<00:03:55.550> four<00:03:55.790> five<00:03:56.000> six<00:03:56.209> the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
scale one two three four five six the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.330 
scale one two three four five six the
seventh<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.379> major<00:03:57.560> scale<00:03:57.890> that's<00:03:58.129> C

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
seventh of the major scale that's C

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.680 
seventh of the major scale that's C
major<00:03:58.580> seven<00:03:59.530> whereas<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.709> C<00:04:01.099> seventh<00:04:01.879> or<00:04:02.360> C

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
major seven whereas that C seventh or C

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.660 
major seven whereas that C seventh or C
dominant<00:04:02.989> seven<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:03.680> two<00:04:03.739> kinds<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.280> sevenths

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
dominant seven so two kinds of sevenths

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.880 
dominant seven so two kinds of sevenths
I've<00:04:04.790> dominant<00:04:05.239> seventh<00:04:05.629> and<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.900> major<00:04:06.110> 7<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
I've dominant seventh and a major 7 and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.059 
I've dominant seventh and a major 7 and
notice<00:04:07.700> once<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.629> find<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> six<00:04:09.260> then<00:04:09.890> it's

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
notice once you find the six then it's

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.420 
notice once you find the six then it's
easy<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.459> find<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.819> seventh<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:13.220> major

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
easy to find the seventh and a major

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.750 
easy to find the seventh and a major
sevenths<00:04:13.970> half<00:04:14.269> step<00:04:14.540> above<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:15.019> so<00:04:15.760> every

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
sevenths half step above that so every

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.000 
sevenths half step above that so every
time<00:04:16.940> we<00:04:17.120> add<00:04:17.329> us<00:04:17.600> six<00:04:17.870> or<00:04:18.139> seventh<00:04:18.590> or<00:04:18.769> major

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
time we add us six or seventh or major

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.500 
time we add us six or seventh or major
so<00:04:19.280> they're<00:04:19.519> just<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.760> half<00:04:19.910> step<00:04:20.120> away<00:04:20.269> from

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
so they're just a half step away from

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.390 
so they're just a half step away from
each<00:04:20.630> other<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.139> very<00:04:21.229> easy<00:04:21.380> okay

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
each other so it's very easy okay

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.969 
each other so it's very easy okay
for<00:04:23.030> example<00:04:23.389> here's<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:24.229> six<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.830> where

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
for example here's have six so where

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.770 
for example here's have six so where
does<00:04:25.040> he<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:25.250> step<00:04:25.460> yeah<00:04:26.419> that's<00:04:26.630> right

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
does he have step yeah that's right

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.890 
does he have step yeah that's right
there<00:04:27.200> where's<00:04:27.830> MA<00:04:28.220> jure<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.510> mention<00:04:29.840> it

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
there where's MA jure so you mention it

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.159 
there where's MA jure so you mention it
right<00:04:30.020> there<00:04:30.760> that's<00:04:31.760> G<00:04:32.060> 6<00:04:32.419> where's<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.780> 7th

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
right there that's G 6 where's the 7th

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.520 
right there that's G 6 where's the 7th

yeah that's g7 X G major 7

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.920 
yeah that's g7 X G major 7
that's<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.900> 6d<00:04:38.900> 7d<00:04:39.889> matrix<00:04:40.700> m<00:04:41.560> e6<00:04:42.560> e7<00:04:43.330> e<00:04:44.330> major

Mayers<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.380> it's<00:05:15.530> easy<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.889> find<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.220> sixth

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
Mayers so it's easy to find a sixth

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.240 
Mayers so it's easy to find a sixth
seventh<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.180> major<00:05:17.419> 7<00:05:17.840> now<00:05:18.440> as<00:05:18.680> we've<00:05:18.860> said<00:05:19.070> we

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
seventh and major 7 now as we've said we

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.580 
seventh and major 7 now as we've said we
can<00:05:19.400> also<00:05:19.610> do<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.270> minor<00:05:20.510> chord<00:05:20.840> we<00:05:21.440> had

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
can also do that to a minor chord we had

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.440 
can also do that to a minor chord we had
a<00:05:21.620> minor<00:05:21.919> saved<00:05:22.460> anyway<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.000> we<00:05:23.150> can<00:05:23.270> have<00:05:23.419> a

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
a minor saved anyway so we can have a

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.210 
a minor saved anyway so we can have a
minor<00:05:23.720> 7th

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
minor 7th

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.980 
minor 7th
seventh<00:05:25.580> chords<00:05:25.850> are<00:05:25.940> very<00:05:26.120> mellow<00:05:26.420> kinds<00:05:26.870> of

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
seventh chords are very mellow kinds of

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:43.679 
seventh chords are very mellow kinds of
chords<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.980> hear<00:05:28.190> them<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.430> lot<00:05:28.580> of

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.229 

and<00:05:44.649> you<00:05:44.739> can<00:05:44.859> also<00:05:45.009> use<00:05:45.339> a<00:05:45.369> major<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.909> seventh

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:46.239 
and you can also use a major of seventh

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.209 
and you can also use a major of seventh
on<00:05:46.419> a<00:05:46.449> later<00:05:46.779> board<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.379> that<00:05:47.439> creates<00:05:47.829> a<00:05:47.979> kind

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
on a later board and that creates a kind

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.639 
on a later board and that creates a kind
of<00:05:48.519> a<00:05:48.639> dissonance<00:05:49.149> out<00:05:49.359> there's<00:05:50.259> a<00:05:50.349> place<00:05:50.619> for

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:50.649 
of a dissonance out there's a place for

00:05:50.649 --> 00:06:00.419 
of a dissonance out there's a place for
that<00:05:54.959> so<00:05:55.959> two<00:05:56.439> kinds<00:05:56.769> of<00:05:56.889> sevens<00:05:59.309> except<00:06:00.309> you

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:00.429 
that so two kinds of sevens except you

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:03.089 
that so two kinds of sevens except you
can<00:06:00.549> do<00:06:00.699> it<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.999> a<00:06:01.029> more<00:06:01.329> that's<00:06:02.289> a<00:06:02.439> called<00:06:03.039> a

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
can do it to a more that's a called a

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.669 
can do it to a more that's a called a
minor<00:06:03.309> seventh<00:06:03.729> in<00:06:03.879> some<00:06:04.119> later<00:06:04.389> major<00:06:05.169> seven

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:05.679 
minor seventh in some later major seven

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.599 
minor seventh in some later major seven
okay<00:06:06.719> so<00:06:07.719> that's<00:06:07.959> it<00:06:08.169> for<00:06:08.439> four-note<00:06:09.009> chords

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:09.609 
okay so that's it for four-note chords

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:12.029 
okay so that's it for four-note chords
now<00:06:09.699> there<00:06:10.239> are<00:06:10.419> five<00:06:10.749> mill<00:06:10.989> chords<00:06:11.439> but<00:06:11.679> to<00:06:11.889> do

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
now there are five mill chords but to do

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.489 
now there are five mill chords but to do
that<00:06:12.249> we<00:06:12.519> have<00:06:12.639> to<00:06:12.849> do<00:06:13.059> them<00:06:13.239> in<00:06:13.359> two<00:06:13.599> parts<00:06:14.049> and

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:14.499 
that we have to do them in two parts and

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.619 
that we have to do them in two parts and
we'll<00:06:15.099> consider<00:06:15.489> that<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:16.029> the<00:06:16.059> next<00:06:16.389> segment

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
we'll consider that in the next segment

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:26.050 
we'll consider that in the next segment
so<00:06:17.019> we'll<00:06:17.169> see<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.379> then

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.120
