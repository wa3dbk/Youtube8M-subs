00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
being based so I'm actually pretty

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
being based so I'm actually pretty
yellow<00:01:21.359> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.439> undertones<00:01:22.829> of<00:01:23.039> my<00:01:23.159> skin<00:01:23.399> are

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
yellow and the undertones of my skin are

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
yellow and the undertones of my skin are
all<00:01:23.670> sort<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.390> quite<00:01:24.630> yellow<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.079> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.350> see

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
all sort of quite yellow and you can see

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.029 
all sort of quite yellow and you can see
that<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> didn't<00:01:28.079> have<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
that but if I didn't have this on you

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.709 
that but if I didn't have this on you
would<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.430> you've<00:01:29.969> got<00:01:30.090> pink<00:01:30.299> undertones

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
would think you've got pink undertones

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.649 
would think you've got pink undertones
and<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.289> so<00:01:32.159> here's<00:01:32.969> a<00:01:33.030> mud<00:01:33.270> palette

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and I don't so here's a mud palette

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.380 
and I don't so here's a mud palette
which<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.899> use<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.359> just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
which I use a lot now if you would just

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.169 
which I use a lot now if you would just
look<00:01:36.719> at<00:01:36.840> these<00:01:37.219> actually<00:01:38.219> these<00:01:38.369> colors<00:01:38.820> here

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
look at these actually these colors here

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.510 
look at these actually these colors here
would<00:01:39.689> suit<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.500> better<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.310> sort

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
would suit me much better with this sort

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.510 
would suit me much better with this sort
of<00:01:41.579> skin<00:01:41.820> coloring<00:01:42.149> I've<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.990> face

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
of skin coloring I've got it on my face

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
of skin coloring I've got it on my face
but<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.700> actually<00:01:45.240> more<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.229> these

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
but it's actually more like these

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.599 
but it's actually more like these
colours<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:48.359> actually<00:01:48.600> match<00:01:49.609> this

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
colours here which actually match this

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
based I'm yellow based and this is where

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.670

a<00:04:33.610> lot<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.820> people<00:04:33.970> go<00:04:34.240> wrong<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.660> still<00:04:35.290> think

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
a lot of people go wrong I still think

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.770 
a lot of people go wrong I still think
that<00:04:35.980> neutral<00:04:36.640> foundations<00:04:37.180> are<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.630> way<00:04:37.750> to

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
that neutral foundations are the way to

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.130 
that neutral foundations are the way to
go<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.320> really<00:04:38.890> do<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.400> going<00:04:39.669> to

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
go I really do just going to

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.870 
go I really do just going to
even<00:04:40.560> things<00:04:40.770> up<00:04:40.950> here<00:04:41.160> I'm<00:04:41.310> talking<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.760> you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
even things up here I'm talking to you

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.910 
even things up here I'm talking to you
because<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:42.990> think<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.200> lot<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.470> foundations

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
because I think a lot of foundations

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.190 
because I think a lot of foundations
nowadays<00:04:44.370> are<00:04:44.580> turning<00:04:45.420> towards<00:04:45.810> having<00:04:45.930> too

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
nowadays are turning towards having too

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.410 
nowadays are turning towards having too
much<00:04:46.350> yellow<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:47.580> that's<00:04:47.760> you

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
much yellow in and I think that's you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.850 
much yellow in and I think that's you
know<00:04:48.510> just<00:04:48.810> as<00:04:48.930> bad<00:04:49.110> as<00:04:49.260> I'm<00:04:49.380> having<00:04:49.620> too<00:04:49.770> much

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
know just as bad as I'm having too much

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.570 
know just as bad as I'm having too much
pink<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.370> but<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.210> many<00:04:51.420> people<00:04:51.890> are<00:04:52.890> not<00:04:53.310> as

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
pink in but so many people are not as

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.150 
pink in but so many people are not as
yellow<00:04:54.030> based<00:04:54.390> as<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.170> foundations<00:04:55.680> are<00:04:55.890> and

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
yellow based as the foundations are and

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.410 
yellow based as the foundations are and
they're<00:04:56.370> not<00:04:56.460> as<00:04:56.580> pink<00:04:56.760> based<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.210> think

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
they're not as pink based and I think

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.570 
they're not as pink based and I think
this<00:04:57.690> tryna<00:04:58.530> find<00:04:58.800> foundation<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.400> more

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
this tryna find foundation is more

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.820 
this tryna find foundation is more
neutral<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.270> a<00:05:00.540> really<00:05:00.810> really<00:05:01.500> good<00:05:01.680> way<00:05:01.800> to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
neutral is a really really good way to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.370 
neutral is a really really good way to
go<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:03.150> that's<00:05:03.300> why<00:05:03.480> I<00:05:03.510> blend<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.900> lot<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.200> Mac

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
go and that's why I blend a lot of a Mac

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.900 
go and that's why I blend a lot of a Mac
foundations<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.150> NW<00:05:06.150> say<00:05:06.780> NW<00:05:07.470> 15<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.010> NC<00:05:08.340> 15

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
foundations the NW say NW 15 and NC 15

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.390 
foundations the NW say NW 15 and NC 15
I<00:05:08.940> tend<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.480> blend<00:05:09.750> them<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.710> end<00:05:11.190> up

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
I tend to blend them so that I end up

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.150 
I tend to blend them so that I end up
with<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:12.560> shade<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:14.610> kind<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.880> matches<00:05:16.160> you

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
with a shade that kind of matches you

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.280 
with a shade that kind of matches you
know<00:05:17.310> skin<00:05:17.550> tones<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.850> lot<00:05:18.000> easier<00:05:18.390> but<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.200> know

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
know skin tones a lot easier but I know

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.590 
know skin tones a lot easier but I know
it's<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.620> ridiculous<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:20.850> of<00:05:20.940> demonstration

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
it's a ridiculous kind of demonstration

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.690 
it's a ridiculous kind of demonstration
but<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.900> really<00:05:22.110> just<00:05:22.230> wanted<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.620> kind<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.490> show
