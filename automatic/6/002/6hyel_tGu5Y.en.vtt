talking<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.850> people<00:02:02.000> in<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.210> forums<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
talking to people in the forums and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.359 
talking to people in the forums and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.469 
hearing how much it changed their lives
I<00:02:04.640> thought<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.090> know<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.450> could<00:02:05.600> be<00:02:05.720> me<00:02:06.430> yes

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
I thought you know that could be me yes

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.960 
I thought you know that could be me yes
it's<00:02:08.479> probably<00:02:08.630> one<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.989> biggest

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it's probably one of the biggest

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.520 
it's probably one of the biggest
life-changing<00:02:10.970> experiences<00:02:11.690> I've<00:02:11.870> had<00:02:11.900> you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
life-changing experiences I've had you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.000 
life-changing experiences I've had you
