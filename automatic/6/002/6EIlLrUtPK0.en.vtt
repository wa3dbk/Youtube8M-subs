up on top and we'll show you some of the
features<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.920> top<00:03:48.210> and<00:03:49.210> we'll<00:03:49.420> go<00:03:49.540> sort<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.840> go

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
features on top and we'll go sort of go

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.200 
features on top and we'll go sort of go
from<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:50.740> shoots<00:03:51.160> also<00:03:51.610> mention<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
from there this shoots also mention it

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.420 
from there this shoots also mention it
has<00:03:52.390> an<00:03:52.540> A<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.870> B<00:03:53.020> button<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.310> B

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
has an A and B button the a and B

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.820 
has an A and B button the a and B
buttons<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.940> saw<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.570> controller<00:03:56.470> also

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
buttons I saw that this controller also

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.900 
buttons I saw that this controller also
has<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.270> select<00:03:58.870> AGM<00:03:59.800> gel<00:04:00.580> or

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
has it that you can select AGM gel or

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.760 
has it that you can select AGM gel or
flooded<00:04:01.390> battery<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:01.990> it<00:04:02.110> depends<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:02.590> what

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
flooded battery so it depends on what

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.680 
flooded battery so it depends on what
battery<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.310> got<00:04:03.520> so<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:03.880> always<00:04:04.030> set<00:04:04.360> them<00:04:04.540> up

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
battery you got so we always set them up

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.720 
battery you got so we always set them up
on<00:04:04.900> number<00:04:05.080> one<00:04:05.440> which<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.860> flooded<00:04:06.310> battery

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
on number one which is a flooded battery

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.180 
on number one which is a flooded battery
and<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.930> if<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.140> did<00:04:08.320> change<00:04:08.620> your<00:04:08.800> battery

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
and but if you did change your battery

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.090 
and but if you did change your battery
on<00:04:09.430> your<00:04:09.490> coach<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.680> choose<00:04:11.920> to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
on your coach because you choose to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.500 
on your coach because you choose to
change<00:04:12.400> change<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.940> because<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.270> don't<00:04:13.390> want

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
change change it because you don't want

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.540 
change change it because you don't want
flooded<00:04:14.020> it<00:04:14.380> also<00:04:14.800> selects<00:04:15.220> on<00:04:15.459> the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
flooded it also selects on the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.190 
flooded it also selects on the
controller<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.150> what<00:04:16.239> kind<00:04:16.480> of<00:04:16.600> battery<00:04:16.930> got

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
controller and what kind of battery got

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.830 
controller and what kind of battery got
so<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.530> knows<00:04:17.709> what<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.100> charging<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.840> really

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
so it knows what it's charging a really

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.630 
so it knows what it's charging a really
neat<00:04:20.020> system<00:04:20.230> so<00:04:20.590> we'll<00:04:20.739> go<00:04:20.859> on<00:04:20.890> top<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.489> roof

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
neat system so we'll go on top the roof

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.159 
neat system so we'll go on top the roof
and<00:04:21.850> we'll<00:04:21.940> show<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.180> what<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.630> what<00:04:23.140> the

and we'll show you what the what the

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.920 
and we'll show you what the what the
solar<00:04:23.470> panel<00:04:23.950> looks<00:04:24.130> like<00:04:24.310> up<00:04:24.490> above

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
