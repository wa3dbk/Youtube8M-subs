00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.469
Indigenous smartphone maker, Spice has been
in news a lot this year, thanks to its foray

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.890
into newer avenues such as a Firefox OS-based
smartphone and a smartwatch-cum-phone. With

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.769
its Dream UNO Mi-498, the brand also became
part of the Android One trio. But Spice isn�t

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.890
losing focus on its core Android offerings,
and it has just announced the Stellar 520n

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.220
catering to the budget segment.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.620
We have just got the device in our labs, and
as always, let�s greet it with a quick unboxing

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.460
and then take a closer look at Stellar 520n.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.270
One of the biggest USPs of the Spice Stellar
520n is its colourful back panels, and hence

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.110
the device also comes packed in a vibrant-looking
rectangular box. Prying open the box reveals

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.120
the smartphone itself, available in a red
hue. Let�s keep it aside for a moment and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.130
see what else is bundled in its retail packaging.
You get a screen protector to safeguard its

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.310
display against scratches, along with a user
manual, warranty card and a list of service

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.390
centres. In terms of accessories, there�s
a charging adapter, a micro-USB cable and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.340
stereo earphones. You also get a battery,
which we will be inserting in the device in

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.340
a while.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.540
Interestingly, if red doesn�t suits your
taste, then you can replace the rear cover

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.890
of the phone with this classy white or bright
yellow panel. But that's not all as for protection

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.670
of the smartphone, you also get a flip cover.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.970
Now, let�s turn on the Spice Stellar 520n.
Till the time it�s getting started, let�s

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.599
talk a bit about its design and build quality.
Of course, what catches your attention at

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.129
first is its red back, which is glossy. This
means that the plastic cover will be prone

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:03.140
to fingerprints and smudges. The front is
dominated by a 5-inch display panel. Above

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.819
the screen, you get an earpiece, a couple
of sensors and a secondary camera. The phone

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:15.220
also gets a standard row of capacitive buttons
with backlighting for navigation.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.400
The right spine of the Stellar 520n sports
a volume rocker followed by the power key.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.200
While the left and bottom sides are completely
empty, a micro-USB port for charging and data

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.909
transfer, along with a 3.5mm socket is available
on the top. The back houses main camera along

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.310
with an LED flash, Spice branding and a speaker
mesh.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.980
The smartphone has been powered on and here�s
a look at its interface, which seems to be

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.010
stock Android only. However, the icons on
the Android v4.4 KitKat seems to be completely

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.659
customised and there�s a ton of preloaded
content as well. Along with a suite of apps

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:03.499
from Google, it includes ASKME, Hungama, Quikr,
and WhatsApp among others. There�s also

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:10.510
useful apps such as Battery Doctor to allow
you to make use of the Stellar 520n�s battery

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.760
efficiently.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.599
The 5-inch display of the Spice Stellar 520n
features a resolution of 1,280 x 720 pixels.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.090
The display seems to be quite vibrant and
text appears to be sharp as well. Powering

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.980
the show is a quad-core processor from MediaTek,
with each core humming at 1.3GHz. It�s coupled

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.150
with a gigabyte of RAM. With such a combination,
the smartphone seems to be quite responsive

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.300
and there isn�t any sluggishness.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.599
In the storage department, the device offers
an 8GB built-in memory, which can be increased

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.400
further by making use of a microSD card of
up to 32GB.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.159
Camera optics of the phone includes an 8-megapixel
autofocus camera at the back and a 2MP secondary

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.299
shooter. For shooting in low-light situations,
the rear sensor is assisted by an LED flash.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.609
Overall, the Spice Stellar 520n looks like
a good option in the budget segment, especially

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.930
for those who like variety in their life,
since they can change the back panel of the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.340
device whenever they want. We will have more
to say about the phone in our review. So stay

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
tuned.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.800
Thanks for watching.
