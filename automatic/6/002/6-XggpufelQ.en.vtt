00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.410
 I will 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.410
 Eye segment yes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.889
 Please 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.889
 Being watched the 5 game of Guatemala 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 Well that's right 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:29.710
 It is said that there is no go 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:32.370
 Never become too reference I had a lower bit level it is at the Well friendlies 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.370
 But 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.520
 Oh dear 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:43.090
 1 In Japan, where are you trying to achieve the trend now ? 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:49.900
 I felt that the level was a little low after all 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.370
 But its now know as or full Well team that attack team that lost the confidence profitable 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.670
 It is 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.840
 that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.530
 In not good tan is to say the balance of the offense and defense 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.530
 It feels like it's good in that sense 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.980
 Except for a 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.640
 Engraved the self-help of 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.350
 Yes, I've done six matches 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.350
 3 is enough for revision 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 Well I think this is the whole already, and so is how the ball is taken away 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:34.380
 Positioning of the middle line of the defense line when the ball is Burley 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.729
 Also this problem a place called risk management is I think a lot of it, of course 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.729
 Set play also available. Cine 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.010
 The public is 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.010
 I get in 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.549
 This is not really just a matter of doubt 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:02.819
 Of course not only the scene where you make that goal but the defense line finally 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.219
 While I'm looking at it from there I cut off the real sumo wrestling 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.540
 Logical poor how to catch the ball 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.540
 word or midfield 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.790
 Well if the way of taking the ball is bad while tacking third or on the way 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.160
 There is one problem in the back line because it is not ready 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.160
 Or 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.710
 That filter at the middle part of the boronch 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.980
 And out of the ball is a through ball in less than the grade 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.760
 There are many things to do, so in the end meanwhile in that sense 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.340
 Pure print 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.019
 It is a scene that say Toka do not have to respond to the other party 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.100
 Because there are many coming out, it seems like the defense line collapses by all means 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.850
 I will be issued but 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.850
 Hey front you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.740
 It was done 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.380
 Well, I was able to defend on the front after the ball was taken to some extent 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.380
 And I think 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:10.780
 Just that 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:14.770
 Well there have been problems with 4 other games until today , 4 other than the municipality of the border. 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.520
 It is a place called line control of the defensive line 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.470
 After all there was part that was not made yet in the first half today, too 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.620
 In that sense still 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 There is a part that can not be done 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.680
 The rest is the preparation for Parinjisk management 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.430
 That two these things are particularly glaring 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.430
 It is taxation that is table 6 game 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.040
 That's right 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.239
 About three times in the first half there was such a part 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.700
 From the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:55.110
 Maybe after entering the second half 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.379
 I think that there was a surrounding from Zaccheroni but after all risk management behind 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.670
 The origin of the other center-forward opponent at the 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.650
 Since firmly processing place called the origin of the attack is one person with the aim is to cover 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:11.090
 It'll also be able to firmly crush in so 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:15.290
 But in the first half there was also a scene that was not able to do that and was headed there 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:19.420
 There was a scene that went ahead between the defense line and the midfield 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:25.060
 Well there is also that it is bad how to catch it 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.530
 After all the scene where line was not pushed up although we were in pressure well 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.730
 There were many 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.730
 I felt today that there is a need to fix it , because there are also 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.009
 For example 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.849
 The moment you grab the ball 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:52.679
 Your opponent will attack first, in the same position as the defense line 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:57.660
 There is no moment when the opponent's forward is in and you grab the ball. 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:05:01.900
 The ball was in the ward and the forward ran 10 meters ago 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.320
 In the defense line if you raise the line slowly as it is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.880
 The distance between the front and the Kyungs line will increase 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.729
 That's why 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.350
 For example, forward 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.810
 If it is 10m spin, Junsai also 10 meters 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:22.000
 By sprint raising line 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:25.680
 There is almost no chance that the opponent's forward will come back so early, of course. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.660
 If you have a high opponent, but hardly any 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.820
 Then maybe the certain forward is has become compact also been deprived of the ball 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.130
 The other party's forward is 2 people 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.130
 If you're in offside position 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:49.559
 Is an aspect say forward and the defense 10 to between 8 at the one more time the middle 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:51.449
 I think I can depending on it to do so is was was one two three often up to the ball 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:57.330
 I can go and enclose it 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:58.910
 And in a good cycle of taking the ball once again and giving a lecture again 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.289
 I think it will be 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:07.199
 Just that 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:08.650
 After all, the ball catches up to this four games ago neon ca and the line pushes up in the moment 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:15.130
 Not 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:20.830
 Because there were many new games, I have to bring the ball in a good way to the opponent and I have to go down in the chain 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:23.729
 Because the situation was a lot Tteyuu and wonder if there was a lot of painful time zone in which 3 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.729
 I feel like that
