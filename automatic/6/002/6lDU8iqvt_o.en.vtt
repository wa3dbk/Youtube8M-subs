00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.310
 louis 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.620
 the question 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.420
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.430
 As you can see, you are facing the construction 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.010
 biggest that I have built for me 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 canal and it is an airport 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.790
 to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.250
 As you can see, we have here the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.090
 agency offices to leave the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.090
 suitcases and other 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.500
 we also have a seating bar 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.549
 Y 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.690
 here we have here we have an elevator 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.690
 to climb to the top 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 As you can see, you can also go up 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.030
 stairs 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.310
 and this is the area of the terminal that 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.570
 we have access to planes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.570
 we support the metal detector 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.120
 there we have the information where it would be 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.540
 all flights and dormer skylights 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.540
 upwards 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.400
 as you see we have several 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 places like these with seats and others 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.080
 where can we society or planes 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.660
 a note 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.629
 As you can see, we enter the airplanes 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.629
 here 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.440
 one 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 ah 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.790
 yes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.180
 all are equal as you see present 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.180
 all the planes that there are 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.700
 down these stairs we go down 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.700
 to creative baths 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.620
 in love 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.590
 and here we can leave 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.590
 to the part to the runway to the airport 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.050
 as she is below 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:28.510
 before you can see I have also placed 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.730
 cisterns 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.300
 that are like filling in the deposits 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.300
 of the airplane 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.660
 As you can see there are quite a few airplanes 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.660
 different companies 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.470
 you see also that sometimes there are all of 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.470
 map that does not load 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.630
 and that's because airport is very big 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.630
 and even if so turn it ain in 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.140
 distance has done extreme is not 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.140
 enough 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.130
 over here we go to the view of this d 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.130
 ah 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.980
 you know how in all my 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.910
 constructions you have the link of 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.910
 friction discharge 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.310
 dense that widened track this is the 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.310
 Landing track 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.449
 ah 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.610
 ah 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.979
 how 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.020
 one more 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.720
 here is a mine landing this wise 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.350
 bigger here at the airport is a 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.350
 boeing 747 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.740
 never 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:30.950
 as you can see is quite large color 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.780
 placed here until the flaps that are 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.010
 this here is what will help the 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.010
 plane does not fall to the ground 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:56.459
 around here we see the airport again 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.819
 you can here we also have another plane and 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.819
 on the runway 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.270
 one 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.569
 and well, this is all if it has 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.819
 liked the map give the aik subscribe 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:31.669
 channel to see more constructions already 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.280
 you know in my channel you have many more 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.259
 Exceptions modern houses of all kinds 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.060
 that is light web can effort of 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.669
 build this piece of building with 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.500
 the planes and the whole truth takes me 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.389
 something quite time is one of the 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:51.080
 constructions that more time has 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:51.080
 taken and good this is all goodbye
