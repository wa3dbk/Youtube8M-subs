00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello everyone and this is dope today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.700
 mod that allows you to create statues 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.800
 ourselves and so we start and leave a little 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.800
 from the topic as you noticed I am now in such 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.740
 the building they are in the meadow as usual now 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.510
 I will conduct all the reviews here 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.240
 This and so to speak called his 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.760
 mods labs that i built 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.769
 different rooms and which will fit under 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 different types of mods it still 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.010
 being built but already at the completion stage in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.690
 overall I hope you enjoy and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.790
 back to fashion means first thing 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.550
 which gives us fashion is here such here 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.910
 a hammer that is crafted from two 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 iron ingots and two sticks in general from 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 him we make ourselves statues for this to us 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 you need two absolutely any blocks in my 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.039
 case this is a stone right click 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.070
 beat and here we get 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.899
 an exact copy of us if well like me 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 normal skin if you have some other 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 then he will copy your skin completely here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.200
 you are present controllers we 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.900
 differently and can move move 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.320
 here here is the head and the body itself also we 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.010
 can give 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.150
 the name of your statue is any iran randomly and 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.130
 location of body parts 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.270
 I think it would be better if 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.220
 would you still be able to bend your arms well 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 exactly elbows and knees 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.290
 but this, alas, no so here we have done 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.830
 so the next thing that gives us a mod is this 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.670
 such a palette that is crafted here 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.330
 in this way, any three dye 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.729
 with any dyes and any boards with her 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.800
 using we can fully carry 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.740
 our textures on the statue for this we 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.789
 hold down the shift button and press the right 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.430
 button and u so here it is spent but in 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:10.239
 Generally, we repainted the statue in 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.310
 completely our color then right click 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.459
 mouse we can click and see here 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:20.739
 inventory of our our statues we can 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:24.160
 put it there armor different now give it to him 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 two weapons are very epic he's with two 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.140
 swords look like that and then 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:37.450
 control here in different ways 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.680
 control his weapon where to look 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.340
 also then we can from boards to do them 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.770
 here are different 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.960
 here on it it seems everything then that 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.530
 adds a mod this here such here 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.750
 showcases so to speak of them we can invest 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.440
 things and so they will be so fun 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.150
 display a bit in 3d 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 they remind us a little of sky from 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 skyrim showcases even the sound is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.880
 serve and probably you heard 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.310
 Kraft they mean this way 3 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.450
 glass panels two villages 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.200
 pieces of wood and two sticks and we can like this 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.510
 that's easy to take to put something and 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 here it will be seen this a bit to me 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.000
 reminds a frame only here it will be necessary 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.400
 already things completely shift further what 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.790
 I wanted to show you this is my connection 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.480
 turned out such a mini sculpture garden or 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.830
 something like that here so to speak on 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.100
 this is such a terracotta army of my clones 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.310
 all made from ordinary stones with armor 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.760
 and here you can like this 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.450
 of gold you make yourself show your friend and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.180
 He will tell you he is the golden man does not berezhosh 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.500
 you yourself are ours even what you wanted 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.590
 say more 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.930
 break it means the sculpture itself can 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.480
 only using a pickaxe but when you her 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.670
 break it as you see it all disappears 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.600
 that is, if you say you did study 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.620
 expensive material sculpture then already on 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.019
 it did not return well, that in general on 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.790
 This whole mod exhausts if you 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.160
