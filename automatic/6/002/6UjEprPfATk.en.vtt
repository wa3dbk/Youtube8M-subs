00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.660
 95 goalkeeper jonathan orozco 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.050
 justified his euphoric triumph dedicated to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.970
 not only many tigers has happened to me and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.670
 has verified and when 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.910
 it's the other way around, it advances and when it's up 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.950
 he enjoys it nothing happened to me is 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.680
 simply a passion that hurts me 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.220
 classic for me there is no no be this 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.380
 he is not doing things 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.939
 the truth for me is only passion what 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.619
 I enjoy it to the fullest and I see it 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.320
 only for the archer of the monterrey 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.320
 he who loses the classic holds 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.290
 and when it's your turn 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.070
 the compliments they have received from the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.950
 local and national press to jonathan 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.100
 Orozco likes, however, clarified 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.390
 they are an invincible team, we are not like 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.040
 an invincible team or anything for the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.720
 style we have gone from less to more has 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.000
 cost in the beginning costs us a 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.950
 right now we have returned to the level 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.509
 We caught confidence team 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.330
 have won then that's important 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.230
 but neither are we 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.660
 although there is the reach of leadership 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.760
 general jonathan orozco pointed out that what 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.790
 more important is the championship not the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.020
 location in the table although by 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.730
 supposed that the goal of the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.900
 institution is to finish among the 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.450
 first four places as the leadership 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.070
 changed it for a championship has not it 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.560
 I won what was new I took away the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.150
 clear dream they need the results 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.100
 and placing equipment so it can be 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.630
 you finish the first but not the tics 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.220
 or the dream the truth the most important thing 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.320
 is how he asked to rate the videos 4 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.970
 about 300 striped fans are 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.970
 they met at the barreal to support 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.090
 his team after the classic 95 that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.240
 win with eddie door images from 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.340
 the facilities of monterrey 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.340
 multimedia sports jaime heron 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 that we can believe that we can understand 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.140
 of what this element declares if 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 when for small things the press 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.750
 started to get a little bit with him in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.800
 review 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 my name is imbeciles 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.740
 but that does not hold much because let's wait 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.390
 that when it's time to lose if you can hold 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.010
 Do not be the one that gets carried away 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.040
 is the saying is very effusive celebration I do not know 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.250
 surely there was the tribune at one hundred 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 percent of scratches but that yes can 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.500
 provoke violence by 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.180
 foot fans with a little bit 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.970
 like that sure of the player surely 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.670
 hold all that the amateur do not know me 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.560
 about the statement the truth that I in 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.090
 the argument that puts of classic I am 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.490
 totally in agreement with jonathan himself 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.070
 you do not do that if the player does not feel the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.020
 classic will normally be the criticism not 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.330
 the players afterwards do not leave and they 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.540
 put together and you're already at your own parties 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.250
 feel the lightning so be alive and at 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.200
 end of accounts is a passion he says 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.850
 is going to put up with it and maybe it has 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580
 touched the I say lose it has had very 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.820
 good streak and I do not put it seen but that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.800
 that says Victor because I think that in this 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.690
 normal time did not even get by 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.820
 He bear him out for nothing if not already 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.280
 will play as well says but it seems to me that 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.990
 also the situation of what 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.330
 none of the tigers players has 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.370
 ignored this situation of Jonathan 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.319
 orozco and also says that not even what 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.450
 has seen then I think he has taken 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.640
 more importance to the people of the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.890
 monterrey the same players that already 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.989
 They have a good time on Saturday 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 from yesterday taking into account 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.010
 these celebrations and the truth that people 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.930
 of tigers with at least colors 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.940
 have even paid attention or they 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.650
 slip this situation a little bit to me 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.280
 personally, it seems to me that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.390
 can take players with greater 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.730
 personality with greater attributes 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.160
 football players with a greater hierarchy 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.480
 greater record and that is still a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.400
 remote case can be today a luis 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.200
 hernandez to the best that was a guy who 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 is cheated in that way a joaquÃ­n del 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 Elm which is a type also characterizes 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.380
 with those things but not the least 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.440
 appears as his death to the only goalkeeper 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.660
 that I remember with that kind of actions 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.669
 is to calero and for example to look for the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.800
 tribune mess with them warm the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.540
 Help environment liked it and how good 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.930
 that likes the pressure but it tastes good 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.170
 When someone is a figure, it looks good 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.510
 good 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.810
 we are talking about an experience of 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.810
 come
