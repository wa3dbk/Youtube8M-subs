00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello welcome to the back my 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 day today we'll do one again 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.610
 homemade baking mix for 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.540
 those who already do that with the brown ones 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
 have looked 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.400
 Today the condor is in war form 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.049
 with cookies triple chocolate chip 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 cookies to be exact 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 you can do that more wonderfully 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660
 give away and give to those who give 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 No matter how good the banks can be 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 that will definitely succeed because it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 just have a bit of butter and an egg 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.250
 to be added and finished are the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.890
 best triple chocolate chip cookies 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 Anyway, I just have it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 a milk bottle taken from the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.250
 supermarket for example of country love there 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.469
 I then in the hot water with one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
 a little bit washed up the labels 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.129
 let it dry well if my own 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.190
 labels glued on 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.129
 By the way, how can you print it? 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.899
 we round it up is the link or someone 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 yourselves which and behind is the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.370
 then guide for the one who 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 is paid then who the neighbors 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 can do the same with the lid 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.970
 so and now it's time to fill up 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.939
 I made a funnel here 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.250
 from a sheet of paper 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.630
 but like here so pure and we start 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630
 first with the flour 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:42.020
 then a pinch of salt then baking powder and 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:45.469
 vanilla sugar dani brown sugar again 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.399
 that's a bit of a jerk , too 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.399
 nice looks because of the white sugar 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:03.369
 uncouth nuts then the dark one 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.369
 chocolate 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.210
 so then top left over it still remains 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.570
 a bit of space 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.310
 but that is not bad and finished 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.750
 is our cookies baking how nice those 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.520
 could give away as it is now 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.900
 that's what you 're going to do to many people 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.480
 a big pleasure with 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.100
 if you liked the burden 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.510
