00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
first one and I sped up this little clip

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
first one and I sped up this little clip
here<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.950> end<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.550> AFK<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:50.969> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here because I end up going AFK for like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
here because I end up going AFK for like
15<00:00:51.570> 20<00:00:51.780> seconds<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.350> corner<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.280> don't

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
15 20 seconds in the corner I don't

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.639 
15 20 seconds in the corner I don't
really<00:00:54.180> remember<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.780> happened<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.440> why<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
really remember what happened or why I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.110 
really remember what happened or why I
did<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.820> something<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
did that but I think it was something to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.529 
did that but I think it was something to
do<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.420> work<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.840> computer<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:59.539> like

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
do with work on my computer but I'm like

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.290 
do with work on my computer but I'm like
you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.079> using<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.530> MSR<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you can see I'm using the MSR with the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.520 
you can see I'm using the MSR with the
usual<00:01:03.629> sliding<00:01:04.229> gain<00:01:04.409> control<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.580> marksman

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
usual sliding gain control and marksman

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.730 
usual sliding gain control and marksman
using<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> dual<00:01:07.920> comm<00:01:08.570> though<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.530> know

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
using the dual comm though I think know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.810 
using the dual comm though I think know
what<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> hell<00:01:11.100> they're<00:01:11.189> calling<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> the
