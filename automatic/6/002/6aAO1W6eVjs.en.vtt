00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.850
 never 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.590
 already left diego kings about six 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.119
 months when we should emigrate you think 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.570
 create radical in america during 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.570
 many tournaments 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.370
 if for me 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.660
 I already left but 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.120
 there are things that one 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.030
 he wants to tell them but they do not usually 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.430
 happen as one wants them sometimes not 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 so 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.720
 to be quiet not what we expect 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.030
 make a good one makes a good season 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.219
 Y 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.420
 and good that something good comes out for me and 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.339
 for me 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.070
 in fact for the club for all to 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.659
 that we are all happy christian 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.519
 because the figure of the team in your case 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.710
 you put it where you have a little more 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.710
 higher obstacles to emigrate 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.060
 in any this equipment usually happens 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.790
 well I do not think that of always 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.820
 the goal striker because he always tries 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820
 of 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.230
 when he wants to leave because he would leave a hole 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.520
 very big I do not think there are players who 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.880
 are 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.990
 are very important in a campus and I think 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 that when it comes here 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.420
 I knew the club like a player of 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.630
 volleyball and I thought about what was saving 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.050
 cabin here was very very difficult the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 time when he had the problem then 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.990
 until I arrived 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 was 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 they made goals but not like the empty 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.890
 amount that he did when I arrived 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.100
 wanted to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.600
 little by little he was rescuing and here already 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 They are also waiting for you to leave 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 on the other in a front other 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.229
 Ecuadorian in addition and quality a little 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.490
 similar to yours 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:16.210
 is a mine is a great player because 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.910
 when they asked me 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.770
 of the references of him and good I think 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.760
 who were observing him long ago 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.400
 weather miguel este 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.549
 if you see her 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.409
 all the people who want medical were 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.960
 monitoring match by match in the 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:37.660
 Ecuador scored 30 goals, do not touch 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.090
 it is many goals not but good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.750
 we know what they are in the Mexican league 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.390
 here not then what he did there 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.490
 Now you have to prove it here and say that 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.630
 he wants to be a scoring champion but 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.100
 scoring champion of the last two 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.180
 tournaments will have it next today in 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 holder the tough competition to nothing I think 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.020
 that while doing many goals for the 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.930
 team I think a forward always 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.860
 wants to make goals is the idea not if not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.860
 no, it's not forward
