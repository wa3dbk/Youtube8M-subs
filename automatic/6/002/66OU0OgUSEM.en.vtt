at Joe member forever or a long time I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
at Joe member forever or a long time I
know<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.850> ordinance<00:00:33.210> Cena<00:00:33.510> had<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.079> lot<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
know that ordinance Cena had a lot of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.180

many<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> name<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> seems<00:00:39.899> like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
many to name off and it seems like

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.940 
many to name off and it seems like

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.560 
getting handcuffed up to the the ropes
to<00:00:51.449> him<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:53.850> breaking<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
to him you know basically breaking the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.029 
to him you know basically breaking the
ring<00:00:54.750> apart<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.949> look

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
ring apart to get out and make it look

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.110 
ring apart to get out and make it look
like<00:00:56.160> he<00:00:56.219> had<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.430> chance<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:56.940> win

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
like he had a chance to actually win

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.049 
like he had a chance to actually win
this<00:00:57.449> match<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:58.710> predicted<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.520> Orton<00:00:59.969> would

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this match I predicted that Orton would

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
this match I predicted that Orton would
win<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:00.989> loved<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> if

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
win this I would have loved that if

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.100 
win this I would have loved that if
Triple<00:01:01.680> H<00:01:01.920> took<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> belts<00:01:03.149> home<00:01:03.329> somehow<00:01:03.629> but

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Triple H took the belts home somehow but

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
Triple H took the belts home somehow but
it<00:01:04.229> seems<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.500> our<00:01:04.619> new<00:01:05.189> undisputed

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it seems that our new undisputed

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
it seems that our new undisputed
champion<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.750> Randy<00:01:07.049> Orton<00:01:07.490> my

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
champion is going to be Randy Orton my

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770 
champion is going to be Randy Orton my
guess<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> they're<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
guess is that they're going to have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.920 
guess is that they're going to have
matches<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.979> TLC<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.119> Royal<00:01:12.360> Rumble<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
matches at this TLC the Royal Rumble and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.080 
matches at this TLC the Royal Rumble and
the<00:01:13.049> Elimination<00:01:13.590> Chamber<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.369> whoever

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the Elimination Chamber and then whoever

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320 
the Elimination Chamber and then whoever
wins<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.540> rumble<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.530> added<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.330> be

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
wins the rumble will be added on and be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.469 
wins the rumble will be added on and be
the<00:01:18.439> WrestleMania<00:01:19.820> main<00:01:20.820> events<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.299> guess

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the WrestleMania main events I guess

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
the WrestleMania main events I guess
you'd<00:01:21.659> say<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.869> would<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.439> titled<00:01:22.680> that's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you'd say that would be titled that's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
you'd say that would be titled that's
Orton<00:01:23.880> versus<00:01:24.210> Punk<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.140> likely<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
Orton versus Punk but more likely I

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
Orton versus Punk but more likely I
would<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> WV<00:01:26.460> Championship<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
would think that the WV Championship is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
would think that the WV Championship is
going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.299> around<00:01:27.439> Randy<00:01:28.439> Orton<00:01:28.470> because

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
going to be around Randy Orton because

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
going to be around Randy Orton because
the<00:01:29.250> winner<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> rumble<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.079> likely<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the winner of the rumble more likely is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
the winner of the rumble more likely is
going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.799> Daniel<00:01:32.189> Bryan<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:34.579> CM<00:01:35.579> Punk<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
going to be Daniel Bryan or CM Punk is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
going to be Daniel Bryan or CM Punk is
my<00:01:37.079> thought<00:01:37.350> seeing<00:01:37.710> how<00:01:38.009> basically<00:01:38.790> i<00:01:40.340> don't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
my thought seeing how basically i don't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
my thought seeing how basically i don't
know<00:01:41.430> maybe<00:01:41.729> punk<00:01:42.030> vs.<00:01:42.420> inna<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> back

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
know maybe punk vs. inna is in the back

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
know maybe punk vs. inna is in the back
of<00:01:43.740> my<00:01:43.829> mind<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> hundred<00:01:44.700> percent

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of my mind but I'm not a hundred percent

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.630 
of my mind but I'm not a hundred percent
sure<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:45.509> they're<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
sure on what they're going to do but

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.740 
sure on what they're going to do but
