00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
silicone product this process was a very

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
silicone product this process was a very
boring<00:00:57.090> task<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.739> wanted<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> do

it so a Bachelor is allowed us to do is

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.490 
it so a Bachelor is allowed us to do is
to<00:01:01.649> reassign<00:01:02.160> our<00:01:02.640> personnel<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.930> tasks<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to reassign our personnel to tasks that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
to reassign our personnel to tasks that
require<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.220> thinking<00:01:05.750> we

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
require a little bit more thinking we

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
require a little bit more thinking we
run<00:01:06.990> three<00:01:07.350> shifts<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> first<00:01:08.250> shift<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
run three shifts we have a first shift a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.719 
run three shifts we have a first shift a
second<00:01:09.060> shift<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> weekend<00:01:09.930> shift<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.729> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
second shift and a weekend shift and the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.340 
second shift and a weekend shift and the
return<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.210> investment<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
return on investment is just going to be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
return on investment is just going to be
so<00:01:13.470> fast<00:01:13.820> because<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> bachelors<00:01:15.360> ability<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
so fast because of bachelors ability to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
so fast because of bachelors ability to
work<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.380> three<00:01:16.680> shifts<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.280> king

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
work on all three shifts a king

in<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> technology<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.560> working<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
in that technology really working on the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.550 
in that technology really working on the
software<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.350> continuing<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> make

software and and continuing to make

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
software and and continuing to make
improvements<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.630> think<00:02:03.630> Baxter<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
improvements I think Baxter is just the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.880 
improvements I think Baxter is just the
latest<00:02:04.680> example<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.549> how<00:02:05.700> King<00:02:05.969> innovation<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890

investing<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:12.990> automation<00:02:13.380> trying<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> really

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
investing in automation trying to really

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.460 
investing in automation trying to really
be<00:02:14.850> as<00:02:14.940> competitive<00:02:15.420> as<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.140> our

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.590 
be as competitive as we can in our
market<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:17.730> Baxter<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> symbol<00:02:18.570> of

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
market and I think Baxter is a symbol of

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.500 
market and I think Baxter is a symbol of
that<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.050> employees
