00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this at the very very tight-knit

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.450 
this at the very very tight-knit
songwriting<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.439> for<00:01:58.439> something<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.920> tends

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460

that<00:01:59.549> pick<00:01:59.880> up<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:00.329> off<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.810> bit

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that pick up and take off a little bit

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.480 
that pick up and take off a little bit
and<00:02:01.140> especially<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> throw<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> whole

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and especially if you throw that whole

I'm a lot of death metal tag along with
thrash<00:02:04.829> metal<00:02:05.040> sometimes<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
thrash metal sometimes you get a bit of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
thrash metal sometimes you get a bit of
a<00:02:06.810> perception<00:02:07.259> inside<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.920> all<00:02:08.099> man

this is another one of those bands

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.300 
this is another one of those bands
that's<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.739> latching<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that's kind of latching on to this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.339 
that's kind of latching on to this
idea<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:12.940> melodic<00:02:13.330> death<00:02:13.540> metal<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.959> still

this<00:02:24.220> year<00:02:24.430> alone<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:25.150> there's<00:02:25.300> other

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
this year alone and then there's other

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110 
this year alone and then there's other
bands<00:02:25.840> lesser-known<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.830> are<00:02:26.950> still<00:02:27.250> really

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
bands lesser-known that are still really

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.270 
bands lesser-known that are still really
putting<00:02:28.630> forth<00:02:28.900> some<00:02:29.110> pretty<00:02:29.470> decent<00:02:29.739> efforts

putting forth some pretty decent efforts

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.490 
putting forth some pretty decent efforts
but<00:02:30.610> overall<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.840> concept<00:02:32.200> that's

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
but overall this is a concept that's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.250 
but overall this is a concept that's
kind<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.890> become<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.550> sort<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.300> subtext

a sub-genre of metal that is kind of

that's been heard a lot wait for the
revival<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.440> occur<00:02:59.709> because<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.220> bound<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
revival to occur because it's bound to

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
this is a song that has a very very

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.770 
this is a song that has a very very
different<00:03:51.160> sound<00:03:51.609> as<00:03:51.880> far<00:03:52.090> as<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.329> production

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
different sound as far as the production

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.940 
different sound as far as the production
is<00:03:52.900> concerned<00:03:53.319> it's<00:03:53.530> something<00:03:53.799> that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
is concerned it's something that

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.890 
is concerned it's something that
definitely<00:03:54.100> feels<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.760> lot<00:03:54.910> more<00:03:54.970> muddy<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.569> lot

definitely feels a lot more muddy a lot
more<00:03:56.079> raw<00:03:56.410> as<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.400> song<00:03:57.609> itself<00:03:57.850> really<00:03:58.329> is

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
more raw as the song itself really is

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.809 
more raw as the song itself really is
supposed<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.930> sound<00:03:59.170> whereas<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.430> remainder

supposed to sound whereas the remainder

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.190 
supposed to sound whereas the remainder
of<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.030> album<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.450> ten<00:04:01.630> tracks<00:04:01.959> that

what kind of band you're in this has

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.560 
what kind of band you're in this has
become<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.440> commonplace<00:04:32.890> idea<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.970> probably

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
become a commonplace idea and probably

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.980 
become a commonplace idea and probably
an<00:04:34.720> aspect<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.290> metal<00:04:35.950> as<00:04:36.880> far<00:04:37.180> as<00:04:37.210> tradition

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
an aspect of metal as far as tradition

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.250 
an aspect of metal as far as tradition
is<00:04:38.110> concerned<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.970> probably<00:04:40.110> pisses<00:04:41.110> off

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
is concerned that probably pisses off

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.100 
is concerned that probably pisses off
more<00:04:41.770> purists<00:04:42.430> than<00:04:42.760> perhaps<00:04:43.300> they<00:04:43.690> let<00:04:43.900> on

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
more purists than perhaps they let on

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.360 
more purists than perhaps they let on
but<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.650> something<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:45.100> we're<00:04:45.220> dealing

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
but it's something that we're dealing

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.730 
but it's something that we're dealing
with<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:45.910> something<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.360> bands<00:04:46.750> are<00:04:46.930> really

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
with and something that bands are really

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.810 
with and something that bands are really
encouraging<00:04:48.490> or<00:04:48.640> being<00:04:48.850> encouraged<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.720> use
