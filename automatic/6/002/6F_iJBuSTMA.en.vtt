is that the way that you want to taste

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.650 
is that the way that you want to taste
the<00:02:38.080> flavor<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.800> there<00:02:41.980> your<00:02:42.130> mouth<00:02:42.660> it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the flavor in there your mouth it's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.300 
the flavor in there your mouth it's
important<00:02:44.170> when<00:02:44.319> they<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.560> slice<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
important when they you slice and the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.370 
important when they you slice and the
you<00:02:45.430> serving<00:02:45.850> me<00:02:45.970> today<00:02:46.330> need<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.900> be<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.200> same

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
you serving me today need to be the same

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380 
you serving me today need to be the same
thickness<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.250> therefore<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.209> is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
thickness and therefore that is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.440 
thickness and therefore that is
important<00:02:50.019> they<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.739> put<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.700> yuppies<00:02:52.330> in

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
important they you put the yuppies in

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660 
important they you put the yuppies in
salami<00:02:52.870> where<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> very<00:02:53.530> consistence<00:02:54.160> they

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
salami where is a very consistence they

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.080 
salami where is a very consistence they
know<00:02:54.820> move<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.230> way<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
know move so that the way when the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.090 
know move so that the way when the
salami<00:02:58.090> after<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.140> play<00:02:59.320> they're<00:02:59.860> going

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
salami after the play they're going

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.680 
salami after the play they're going
perfectly<00:03:01.560> slice<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.250> way<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:04.450> they<00:03:04.540> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
perfectly slice in this way and they you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.140 
perfectly slice in this way and they you
want<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.050> make<00:03:05.200> sure<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:06.340> are<00:03:06.400> thinner<00:03:06.819> every

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
want to make sure they are thinner every

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.040 
want to make sure they are thinner every
slice<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.110> same

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.730 

because<00:03:11.830> in<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.190> way<00:03:13.050> they<00:03:14.050> give<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
because in this way they give the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.070 
because in this way they give the
consistence<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.520> flavor<00:03:15.880> or<00:03:16.450> every<00:03:16.750> slice

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
consistence of the flavor or every slice

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.120 
consistence of the flavor or every slice
in<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.380> same<00:03:17.680> way<00:03:17.980> there<00:03:18.700> must<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:19.420> fear<00:03:20.350> one

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
in the same way there must be fear one

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.780 
in the same way there must be fear one
day<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.460> look<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.600> machine<00:03:23.310> making<00:03:24.310> sure

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
day you look at the machine making sure

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.750 
day you look at the machine making sure
that<00:03:25.030> she<00:03:25.510> look<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:25.990> because<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.160> make

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
that she look at you because that make

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.650 
that she look at you because that make
it<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.270> machine<00:03:28.780> perfect
