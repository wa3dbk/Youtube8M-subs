00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.620
 she will like to finish again against 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.620
 playing dortmund 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.160
 So who does not really care who 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 the main thing is that we're in there 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 but that was not it was 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.070
 not something special last time 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.689
 it was something special we realized 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.250
 have in the season before with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.130
 dfb cup against dortmund in the finale 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 lost in berlin and we stood 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.189
 naturally powerful under pressure 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 the champions league match in london and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.460
 we knew that we would not spoil it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 allowed and that was a very special one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 situation for us and whether now and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 this year is in the final and against 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.620
 we are playing that we will see 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 but we definitely want a reduction 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 dortmund probably also heard 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 I believe it will last until 2018 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 theme belongs to you I've 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.149
 I thought so rather good job 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.430
 I do not think so synonymous from the club 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.770
 indispensable 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.629
 By the way, you are different from love 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.750
 gerald asamoah says about lÃ¼denscheid 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.320
 he avoids the word of old time but 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 that I am so relaxed 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 We also had to know each other 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
 that's sandra and that means me 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.500
 faith in steel is everyone 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.540
 we have a sweetheart saying that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
 meant dortmund and here because it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 Not everyone stops and that becomes a whole 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 Germany transferred or there is true 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 that would be the whole of Germany we transfer 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 would like to speak on a record 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 he could soon break because you have to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.369
 saying 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
 The has existed since the beginning of the 80s 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.740
 years the hamburger sv has it back then 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 managed 36 games in a row 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 to be unbeaten 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.170
 that's more than seasonal 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 a complete season you can do that in the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.640
 set the next game and then in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 even after the next game even 99 will crack 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.030
 putting up means what is in the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.110
 Team because that is of course already 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.720
 extraordinary record so that's it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.270
 is of course a statistic then 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.860
 is recorded in the last season 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.310
 we have also cracked a few records 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.170
 but what matters in the end is that for us 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.899
 Of course, players are the titles 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.030
 so you can start what that stands 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.800
 then on his autograph card in it and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.239
 Remember you again and again 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.140
 which players do you play together ? 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.209
 I've played the statistics 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.860
 he was with us but he let us 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.540
 Nevertheless, we look forward to that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.580
 hopefully set a record 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 yes that was so, the theme also you 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.239
 has known is the hsv just the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.590
 The team was with at that time 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 a very extraordinary team 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.930
 as long as it did not succeed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.730
 to be beaten 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.680
 Maybe you can record this 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.680
 adjust or even exceed
