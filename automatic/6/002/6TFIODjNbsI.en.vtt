00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:20.590
 Portuguese flans so for that it you 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.300
 must like the utensil a pan a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.689
 wooden spoon 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.640
 a little touch two bowls one of which 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:34.780
 small bowl one around 2 o'clock small 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.370
 mussels that go to the bottom and a pair of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.940
 scissors for the ingredients and you 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:49.510
 will take a liter of milk a pinch of 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:54.690
 salt 125 g flour 500 g sugar 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.690
 powdered cinnamon powder 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:05.130
 eleven egg yolk means a mousse of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.479
 vanilla and puff pastry 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.190
 let's move on to the realization of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.240
 recipe 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 so first let's start with 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.030
 prepare the puff pastry so 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.060
 using the little bowl you make some 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 small shapes on your puff pastry 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 which will allow you to cut them 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.500
 and put them in my little mold 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500
 with the right size 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.100
 think about preheating your oven to 300 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.100
 degrees 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 using your scissors you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.860
 cut the puff pastry at the level 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.860
 markings this with the form 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.190
 think little about parchment paper with 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.640
 vote wished in this way they 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.280
 will not adhere to the little mill you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.500
 place your puff pastry in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.630
 inside the little word like this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 and you book your mold the time of 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.860
 to make twelve possible 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.490
 So here we get 12 small molds 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 with puff pastry you take 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.100
 your little bowl and your big bowl you 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.900
 you break the eggs separating the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.790
 whites had to play you can 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.740
 use the egg whites for our 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.310
 recipe seen that we are going to use for 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.880
 this recipe that egg yolks so 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 we proceed 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.500
 here are the 12 yellow daf's are in the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.140
 little bowl so when josÃ© said harry 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.510
 white you can book excuses 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.830
 preparation tour 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.570
 we will now prepare the cream 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.770
 so for the preparation of the cream 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:23.350
 you take your pan and 500 g of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:38.090
 sugar to pour into the pan 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:40.750
 the 125 g of flour a pinch of salt and 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.750
 the liter of milk 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.240
 you have all the ingredients in 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.840
 your pan 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.390
 you turn around so that the sugar and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.390
 Women are certainly well in the be 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.480
 Once all the flour and all 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.610
 sugar is well dissolved in the milk 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.580
 take your vanilla base as you 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.980
 go cut into small pieces 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 inside we finished cutting everything 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.780
 vanilla case we take the pan and we 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.750
 put it on a medium heat and proceed to 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.840
 cooking the cream so while at 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.760
 pots and on the fire it takes 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.390
 constantly stir the cream for easter 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.060
 to the task it will be ready at the moment 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.800
 the cream will become thick and will not stick 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:44.430
 more spoon so here we get 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:47.220
 a very thick and creamy paste so 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.910
 when she adheres to pu level 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.730
 spoon is she is ready 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.190
 this is the truce to the required consistency 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.610
 we take it out of the fire you leave it 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.630
 cool a little bit a few minutes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.430
 before incorporating egg yolks 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.400
 here are some mines passed in 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.470
 your cream has a little cooled you is 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.010
 directly incorporated the egg yolks 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.010
 and you mix 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:31.760
 but to mix well so that all 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.690
 yellow be integrated into the cream so 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.210
 Once upon a time your cream is ready 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:42.050
 you just have to take your 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:46.040
 small ladle and your little mold with 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:51.170
 puff pastry and introduce the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:55.810
 cream inside the mold pretty much 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.810
 three quarters like that 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.690
 because the cream will swell 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.320
 so then you put your little ones 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.220
 molds on the oven rack 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.600
 So here you have your water 12 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.960
 little nakta what are ready 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.770
 so there is some cream left to make 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.259
 second batch of what to do 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.620
 it's put in the oven for 25 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.139
 minutes is well monitored than the top 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.270
 cream began to black serves a 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.960
 little bit to be a little bit burned for 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.520
 that the power is either finished so 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.030
 we're in the oven and we're at the 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.620
 after 20 minutes to 25 minutes of cooking 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.800
 not worth bought from natas are ready 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.130
 do not worry about the form in 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.639
 coffee ball cream while cooling its 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.310
 sivas flatten so that's second 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.139
 batch is released so to unmold 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.710
 it's very simple just just the 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.940
 go back and they go out alone from 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:05.340
 their molds so here are our 24 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.919
 little passes you're from the cup or 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:12.479
 ready names to eat them you go 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:15.300
 eat like that or add some 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:19.590
 cinnamon powder on the 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.750
