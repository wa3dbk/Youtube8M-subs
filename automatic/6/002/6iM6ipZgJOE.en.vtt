00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.140
 So heart will be another great one from Epic's Lepper TV 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.009
 and that show yes in this video at Zurich today 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.410
 how your praise there was for export goods Kreuznach the shrinking down or 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.099
 can enlarge 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.759
 and here we go to roll Sal the brand around 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.049
 and then to our library, where the games are stored inside 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.839
 then it rose on a straight line 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.380
 properties 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.439
 State option set 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 and Dante console 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.430
 yes, the media world will always find her description 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.520
 then we have to confirm this with a rookie like that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 and then we know and then 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 7 turn off close again so nothing supplies 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 Bridges or minimize 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 you always 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.660
 and yes now we have to go into the game I would say we see each other at the same time 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.740
 in the mirror and slide 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.380
 It took and here we are again in the game and year 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.500
 Here we see already that crosses of factual issues something is too big 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.750
 she does not laugh at the commission 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.510
 taken the smallest variant 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 india 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 Now we have to underline here in the console CL 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.930
 leaflet 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.120
 Enter Essien 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.220
 and then underlined 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.430
 Frost paralysis 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 in front of him 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.250
 underlined 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.560
 it works 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 and behind it a 1 so that the whole act i did IT so 1 activate 0 for the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.760
 activate 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.030
 since the whole with another steady now we write one 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.760
 CL underlined 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.860
 Quaas Herne Scale 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 Percent in 2000 I am writing mine now 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.770
 and pirates then they rotten and that is quite a bit smaller 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.220
 and that it just sings percent the bigger the number is the smaller it gets 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.460
 our crosshair the smaller the number, the larger our crosshairs will become 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.399
 and I would recommend you to intervene CL underlined here as well 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.459
 Cross Mr. Percent Alpha 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.549
 around 200 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.560
 then just for that so that the color candied a bit and the percent 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.339
 so that you can recognize something if you go into the light, for example 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.009
 including there was an advantage to his price target 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.649
 well that's all ready now 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.760
 and St dancing is for simplicity as you enjoy it 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.849
 In the past, I used to use eight-thousanders on the Cross r 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.889
 Signals moment where I am here now 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:58.809
 Sperrband Achttausender and what then a little too small people from now on in 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:59.969
 the noted 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.550
 Well, I try with you 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
 4000 this is the 4000's out 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.839
 achieved here 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:14.049
 even too small I would say we use my dear in between 3000 yes 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.489
 3000 is optimal People can not complain 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:23.699
 and via the Wars even from a tutorial percent the Masai drive cross 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.139
 can zoom in or out 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.039
 and I would say I'm out here to rate and comment 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.249
