00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
because moisture on the leaves kind of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
because moisture on the leaves kind of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
stems out that's easy to do with a few

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.869 
stems out that's easy to do with a few
flicks<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> night<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.039> stems<00:01:02.340> are<00:01:02.609> thick
