okay<00:00:06.560> here's<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.240> muffler's<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
okay here's the muffler's that I

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.320 
okay here's the muffler's that I
fabricated<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.740> cut<00:00:11.309> apart<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.639> old<00:00:11.880> one

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
fabricated I cut apart the old one

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.650 
fabricated I cut apart the old one
it<00:00:12.840> had<00:00:13.019> like<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.620> about<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.860> long<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
it had like it was about this long and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.620 
it had like it was about this long and
it<00:00:15.660> had<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:16.590> four<00:00:17.039> five<00:00:17.609> different<00:00:18.119> chambers

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it had like four five different chambers

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.950 
it had like four five different chambers
with<00:00:19.590> different<00:00:19.949> lengths<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> tube<00:00:20.960> different

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
with different lengths of tube different

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.509 
with different lengths of tube different
lengths<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.199> pipe<00:00:22.380> different<00:00:22.859> diameters<00:00:23.490> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
lengths of pipe different diameters of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.439 
lengths of pipe different diameters of
pipe<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:24.500> designed<00:00:25.670> by<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:26.880> dude<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.420> in

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
pipe all designed by some dude back in

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.169 
pipe all designed by some dude back in
the<00:00:27.720> probably<00:00:28.170> 50s<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.820> handy

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the probably 50s it was really handy

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
the probably 50s it was really handy
with<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> slide<00:00:30.630> rule<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.920> figure<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
with a slide rule to figure out all the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.900 
with a slide rule to figure out all the
acoustic<00:00:33.030> wave<00:00:33.239> length<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.230> know

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
acoustic wave length and the you know

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.790 
acoustic wave length and the you know
how<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.969> shock<00:00:36.510> waves<00:00:36.719> cancel<00:00:37.110> e<00:00:37.290> says<00:00:37.530> each

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
how the shock waves cancel e says each

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.770 
how the shock waves cancel e says each
other<00:00:37.980> out<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.820> gutted<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.629> all

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
other out so I gutted it it was all

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.369 
other out so I gutted it it was all
rattle<00:00:40.230> II<00:00:40.320> since<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.829> Chinese<00:00:41.280> like

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
rattle II since the Chinese like

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.299 
rattle II since the Chinese like
everything<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.469> loose<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.890> rattling<00:00:44.190> around

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
everything was loose and rattling around

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
everything was loose and rattling around
inside<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.510> forget<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.200> cut<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
inside so I was like forget it cut it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
inside so I was like forget it cut it
apart<00:00:47.030> now<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> made

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
apart now this one is this what I made

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.930 
apart now this one is this what I made
was<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.039> straight<00:00:50.219> through<00:00:50.579> there's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
was one that's straight through there's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
was one that's straight through there's
a<00:00:51.000> pipe<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.480> ton<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> holes<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> wrapped

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
a pipe a ton of holes in it wrapped

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.689 
a pipe a ton of holes in it wrapped
first<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.140> really<00:00:55.140> tight<00:00:55.520> stainless<00:00:56.520> steel

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
first with really tight stainless steel

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.119 
first with really tight stainless steel
scrubby<00:00:57.120> pad

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
scrubby pad

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.639 
scrubby pad
I<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.910> as<00:00:59.969> tight<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.359> could

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
I got that on there as tight as I could

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.599 
I got that on there as tight as I could
that<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> holds<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.280> toward<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that kind of holds and then toward the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
that kind of holds and then toward the
back<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.270> cuts<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> bent<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.439> with

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
back I put some cuts and bent them with

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.240 
back I put some cuts and bent them with
a<00:01:04.589> screwdriver

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a screwdriver

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
a screwdriver
so<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.180> interrupt<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> celebration

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so that would interrupt the celebration

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
so that would interrupt the celebration
okay<00:01:07.740> well<00:01:07.920> anyway<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
okay well anyway that's how you do that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
okay well anyway that's how you do that
and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> welded<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.290> here

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and then I welded it here in here

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.270 
and then I welded it here in here
that's<00:01:11.340> real<00:01:11.610> ugly<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.240> yeah<00:01:12.900> who<00:01:13.170> cares<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that's real ugly but yeah who cares this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.600 
that's real ugly but yeah who cares this
is<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> sea<00:01:14.910> pan<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> made<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:17.010> then<00:01:17.160> left<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is a sea pan I made and then left out in

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.290 
is a sea pan I made and then left out in
the<00:01:17.670> rain<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.120> like<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.260> days<00:01:19.440> three<00:01:20.010> days

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
the rain for like two days three days

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.000 
the rain for like two days three days
stupid<00:01:21.300> but<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:22.320> looks<00:01:22.410> okay<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.800> I

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
stupid but it still looks okay so I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.360 
stupid but it still looks okay so I
guess<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.310> weatherproof<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.500> fiberglass<00:01:25.980> I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
guess it's weatherproof the fiberglass I

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.150 
guess it's weatherproof the fiberglass I
molded<00:01:26.820> straight<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.510> top<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.960> bike

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
molded straight to the top of the bike

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210 
molded straight to the top of the bike
and<00:01:29.450> then<00:01:30.450> shaped<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.960> cut<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:31.980> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and then shaped it cut it down and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.400 
and then shaped it cut it down and
shaped<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:32.790> liked<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:34.050> one

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
shaped it to how I liked there's one

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.190 
shaped it to how I liked there's one
layer<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:35.060> carpet<00:01:36.060> underlayment<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.870> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
layer of carpet underlayment in there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
layer of carpet underlayment in there
and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:38.190> some<00:01:38.220> vinyl<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:39.390> I've<00:01:39.600> been<00:01:39.750> more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and then some vinyl if I've been more

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.750 
and then some vinyl if I've been more
careful<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.590> would<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.070> gotten<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> much<00:01:41.550> nicer

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
careful I would have gotten a much nicer

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.570 
careful I would have gotten a much nicer
stretch<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.540> finish<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.080> vinyl<00:01:43.460> since<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
stretch and finish on the vinyl since it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.550 
stretch and finish on the vinyl since it
fits<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:44.970> snug<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.870> need<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.290> little

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
fits so snug all I will need is a little

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.150 
fits so snug all I will need is a little
bit<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.940> industrial-strength<00:01:47.940> velcro<00:01:49.160> stuck
