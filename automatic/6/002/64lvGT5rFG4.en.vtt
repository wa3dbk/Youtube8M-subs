00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
swim now this does two things it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
swim now this does two things it
actually<00:00:42.480> feeds<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> bottom<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> lake

actually feeds the bottom of the lake

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
actually feeds the bottom of the lake
bed<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.789> there's<00:00:45.059> also<00:00:45.239> quite<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.930> amount<00:00:46.469> of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
bed but there's also quite an amount of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
bed but there's also quite an amount of
the<00:00:46.770> product<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.610> freezes<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> hangs

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the product that freezes and hangs

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
the product that freezes and hangs
around<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> big<00:00:49.500> cloud<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> water

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
around in a big cloud up in the water

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.170 
around in a big cloud up in the water
and<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.020> early<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> realized<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and what we early on realized that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
and what we early on realized that
fishing<00:00:54.930> zigs<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> area<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.670> much

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
fishing zigs in this area was so much

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
fishing zigs in this area was so much
more<00:00:57.149> productive<00:00:57.360> than<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> zig<00:00:58.710> out

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
more productive than just a zig out

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.580 
more productive than just a zig out
there<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.160> its<00:00:59.370> own<00:00:59.550> now<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.350> all

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there on its own now it's like all

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
there on its own now it's like all
things<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.399> mix<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.969> brilliant<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.510> we're

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
things the mix is brilliant and we're

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
things the mix is brilliant and we're
never<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> change<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.369> because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
never going to change that but because

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.719 
never going to change that but because

lots of people now are spotting over the
top<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> zinc<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:18.030> try<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
top of zinc so to try and make it a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
top of zinc so to try and make it a
little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.619> instant<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.369> we've<00:01:20.549> done

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
little bit more instant what we've done

recipe<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.680> we've<00:01:28.920> reground<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
recipe and we've reground it down so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.249 
recipe and we've reground it down so
everything<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:31.680> much<00:01:32.009> finer<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:34.020> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
everything is much much finer this now

means that yeah I've got a bother
pre<00:01:36.570> preparing<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> thinking<00:01:37.770> about<00:01:37.890> adding

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
pre preparing it thinking about adding

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
pre preparing it thinking about adding
hot<00:01:38.520> water<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.950> do

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
hot water to it at all what you can do

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
hot water to it at all what you can do
now<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:42.119> take<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.329> particle<00:01:42.990> juice

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now is just take your particle juice

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980 
now is just take your particle juice
take<00:01:43.920> some<00:01:44.100> lake<00:01:44.340> water<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.630> type<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
take some lake water or any type of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.830 
take some lake water or any type of
liquid<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.829> mix<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.659> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
liquid at all mix it in with it now that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
liquid at all mix it in with it now that
does<00:01:49.049> two<00:01:49.380> things<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.979> means<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.820> could

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
does two things it means that you could

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
does two things it means that you could
get<00:01:51.149> far<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:51.540> taste<00:01:52.110> much<00:01:52.890> quicker<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
get far more taste much quicker and

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.389 
get far more taste much quicker and
instantly<00:01:54.149> into<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> sludge<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.159> also

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
instantly into the sludge but it also

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.819 
instantly into the sludge but it also
means<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.810> clouds<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
means that it actually clouds up in the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.280 
means that it actually clouds up in the
water<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.399> faster<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.630> third<00:02:00.899> thing<00:02:01.140> it

does it sinks much much slower so as far

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.609 
does it sinks much much slower so as far
as<00:02:04.799> fishing<00:02:05.219> zinc's<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.540> far<00:02:07.140> far<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
as fishing zinc's it is far far more

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.979 
as fishing zinc's it is far far more
productive<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> better<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.780> out

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
productive to put a better this out

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.510 
productive to put a better this out
there<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.800> few<00:02:11.280> spots<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.790> there

there or a few spots out there

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.220 
there or a few spots out there
because<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.120> amount<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.600> time<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.020> takes

because of that amount of time it takes

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.950 
because of that amount of time it takes
to<00:02:14.440> come<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.310> actually<00:02:15.670> hold<00:02:16.300> fish<00:02:16.780> in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
to come down and actually hold fish in

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.440 
to come down and actually hold fish in
that<00:02:17.110> area<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.070> maximizing<00:02:19.060> those

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
that area so you maximizing those

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.900 
that area so you maximizing those
chances<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.200> take<00:02:20.670> obviously<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.760> you've

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
chances of a take obviously if you've

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.940 
chances of a take obviously if you've
done<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.330> an<00:02:22.450> area<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> fish<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.230> there<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
done it in an area the fish on there you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
done it in an area the fish on there you
still<00:02:24.310> end<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.820> same<00:02:25.030> thing<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
still end up with the same thing on the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.780 
still end up with the same thing on the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the original sludge just a little bit
