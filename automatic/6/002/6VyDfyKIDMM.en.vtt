00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
blowing with a air hose to make sure
that<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.489> no<00:00:38.640> blockages<00:00:39.149> cuz<00:00:39.360> propane

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that there's no blockages cuz propane

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900

isn't<00:00:40.230> flowing<00:00:40.469> from<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> bottles<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.790> where

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
isn't flowing from the bottles to where

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
isn't flowing from the bottles to where
I<00:00:41.940> needed<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> go<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.260> anywhere

out here so there's no blockage in this
at<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.960> that's<00:00:54.960> digging<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.680> adapter

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to put this like thread tape but it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
to put this like thread tape but it's
not<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> same<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.720> water<00:01:24.930> Liza's<00:01:25.320> gas

this in okay so I'm thinking is that the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.560 
this in okay so I'm thinking is that the
problem<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:43.530> right<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> crap

here<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> pressurize<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.840> with

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
here and I want to pressurize this with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and I want to pressurize this with
night<00:02:04.200> about<00:02:04.380> 90<00:02:04.680> psi<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:06.409> fill<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
night about 90 psi and then fill it and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.410 
night about 90 psi and then fill it and
let<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.819> stop<00:02:09.000> real<00:02:09.209> quick

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
let off and stop real quick

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.640 
let off and stop real quick
when<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> pull<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.470> out

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
when I pull this out

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.250 
when I pull this out
there's<00:02:12.400> no<00:02:12.520> pressure<00:02:12.790> blowback<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.720> that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
there's no pressure blowback on it that

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.830 
there's no pressure blowback on it that
means<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.209> blowing<00:02:16.209> out<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.599> just

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
means that it's blowing out of this just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.470 
means that it's blowing out of this just
fine

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
fine

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.350 
fine
but<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:22.920> when<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.910> take<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.239> out

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
but if when I do that and I take it out

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
but if when I do that and I take it out
and<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> air<00:02:25.930> blows<00:02:26.230> back<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.590> me<00:02:26.709> means<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and the air blows back at me means I

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430 
and the air blows back at me means I
pressurize<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.940> whole<00:02:28.150> system<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.750> that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
pressurize this whole system and that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.140 
pressurize this whole system and that
there's<00:02:29.769> blockage<00:02:30.190> somewhere<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.640> here<00:02:30.880> but

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
there's blockage somewhere in here but

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.400 
there's blockage somewhere in here but
I'm<00:02:31.239> thinking<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:31.959> probably<00:02:32.170> this

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
I'm thinking that it's probably this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.570 
I'm thinking that it's probably this
piece<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.680> crap<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:33.040> here<00:02:33.190> needs<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.489> be

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
piece of crap right here needs to be

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.080 
piece of crap right here needs to be
replaced

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
replaced

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.220 
replaced

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
so they're actually let me know that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.559 
so they're actually let me know that
Boyle<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.650> when<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.800> come<00:02:41.980> back<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:43.540> uh

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
Boyle is that when I come back then uh

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.570 
Boyle is that when I come back then uh
yeah<00:02:44.560> get<00:02:45.100> some<00:02:45.220> issues<00:02:45.690> with<00:02:47.250> this
