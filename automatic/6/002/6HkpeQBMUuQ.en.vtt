00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.710
 you only with games and not said things of the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.860
 day 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.860
 I prepared something you hear. 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.779
 Hello, I 'm the pear tree country that this is a 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.119
 School dropped everything and you want it to have 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.020
 as an objective to entertain your 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.780
 public 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.330
 I have to be honest to say that it's the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.730
 bit more complicated than this will 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.690
 why will not this start with your 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.420
 content 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.440
 Do you want to make movies the last games? 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.019
 that came out soft and all clubs 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.809
 game are also making an example 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.909
 Current is gt and so 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.850
 but then what is the difficulty of 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.710
 make an A5 game player today and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.370
 guarantees that this money is not for 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 buy a pc roger that goes well your 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.720
 competitor if all is well and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.159
 Who 's watching this probably? 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.299
 some will deny but there is 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.090
 competition on youtube 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.060
 your channel is considered with the company 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.500
 he has crazy he has a visual identity 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.439
 it has a theme as well as several others 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.649
 Hero channels two or more companies 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.049
 have a theme in common they are 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.210
 considered competitors it is clear that no 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.729
 youtube and this is a much more 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.979
 quiet and normal because its content 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.890
 your product did not see 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.140
 and they are free or your 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.630
 pupil can forget only competition and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.659
 won no problem 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.689
 but that's where the beast begins to pick up on 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.689
 one day on youtube so many are posted 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.490
 videos if for a person watches all 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.749
 the videos posted on that day are 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.079
 needed more than 30 you heard 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:10.369
 right to watch all the videos 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:13.490
 posted on a youtube day going 30 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.600
 ranking years now imagine that of these 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.470
 videos posted in a day 50% are games 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.010
 hence guesses most of the farm 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 gta gameplay 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.989
 your challenge is small the immense your 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.970
 competition is absurd and this 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.510
 is what hinders the growth of your 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.280
 channel 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.409
 but I'm not talking to you either, stop. 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.989
 to do gameplay up to five games ago 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.879
 Are you going to leave? I 'm just saying it's more. 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.860
 complicated for you draw more attention 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.129
 You have to be more creative and 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.230
 innovative because many other channels and 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.200
 draws attention is the key point of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 any channel on youtube is from people 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.540
 of blogs and the content that you 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 chose and of course that quality and also 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.470
 because if you make a video of until 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.970
 assu by mega boot plaster is in the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 galaxies with legging someone will enter 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.739
 in the blood that's going to watch him go 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.230
 redo without lag raise credit 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.260
 I know this video below discouraging 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.150
 than helping more calm tuiuiÃº tube 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.700
 It takes place for everyone 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.670
 so start improving body and here 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.849
 my advice is the first 30 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.549
 understand the attention through your voice 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.000
 that is, with its narration of the river 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.910
 I gave up having fun or even teaching 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.250
 In your game, by luck, I already did a 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.910
 video about narration here at school in 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.620
 youtube 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.329
 so if you did not see I'll leave it
