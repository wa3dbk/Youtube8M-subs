that's<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> straight-up<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.869> run<00:01:13.619> into

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
that's the straight-up just run into

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
that's the straight-up just run into
things<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.460> watch<00:01:14.729> them<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.180> away<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
things and watch them go away kind of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
things and watch them go away kind of
setup<00:01:16.229> it'd<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> great<00:01:17.009> dragon<00:01:17.549> encounter

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
setup it'd be a great dragon encounter

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
setup it'd be a great dragon encounter
and<00:01:18.590> anything<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> isn't<00:01:19.950> poison<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.640> steel

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and anything that isn't poison or steel

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
and anything that isn't poison or steel
you'd<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:21.869> time<00:01:22.080> against

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you'd have a really good time against

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
you'd have a really good time against
mostly<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.460> moonblast

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
mostly because moonblast

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.920 
mostly because moonblast
is<00:01:24.770> extremely<00:01:25.770> powerful<00:01:26.330> also<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> get

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is extremely powerful also if you get

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.130 
is extremely powerful also if you get
the<00:01:28.080> hidden<00:01:28.560> ability<00:01:29.040> what's<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> called

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the hidden ability what's it called

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
the hidden ability what's it called
pixelate<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.350> turns<00:01:31.950> swift<00:01:32.369> into<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> fairy

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pixelate it turns swift into a fairy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
pixelate it turns swift into a fairy
type<00:01:33.479> move<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> believe<00:01:34.229> pixelate<00:01:34.710> also

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
type move and I believe pixelate also

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.609 
type move and I believe pixelate also
grants<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> stab<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.840> getting<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> 90

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
grants it stab so you're getting a 90

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.350 
grants it stab so you're getting a 90
base<00:01:37.799> power<00:01:38.180> swift

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
base power swift

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
base power swift
so<00:01:39.720> an<00:01:39.840> attack<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> never<00:01:40.409> misses<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.860> some

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so an attack that never misses with some

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.149 
so an attack that never misses with some
monstrous<00:01:41.490> stats<00:01:42.500> other<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
monstrous stats other than that you can

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
monstrous stats other than that you can
get<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:44.880> type<00:01:45.090> coverage<00:01:45.450> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
get a really good type coverage with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.469 
get a really good type coverage with
like<00:01:45.720> Shadow<00:01:46.049> Ball<00:01:47.030> okay<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
like Shadow Ball okay that's like the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
like Shadow Ball okay that's like the
only<00:01:48.630> other<00:01:48.869> thing<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> learns<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> mean

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
only other thing it learns but I mean

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.319

with<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> track<00:02:29.610> that'd<00:02:29.850> be<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.090> right

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
with a track that'd be all right

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.600 
with a track that'd be all right
but<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.350> know<00:02:31.500> any<00:02:31.800> pokémon<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.490> learn

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
but you know any pokémon that can learn

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.320 
but you know any pokémon that can learn
psych-up<00:02:32.850> has<00:02:33.180> infinite<00:02:33.870> power<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.740> me<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
psych-up has infinite power to me and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
psych-up has infinite power to me and
especially<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.450> Pokemon<00:02:37.080> has<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:38.250> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
especially if that Pokemon has what is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.400 
especially if that Pokemon has what is
it<00:02:38.570> 394<00:02:39.570> maxed<00:02:40.410> special<00:02:40.920> defense<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.410> was

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it 394 maxed special defense so I was

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.150 
it 394 maxed special defense so I was
looking<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.710> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
looking at that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.370 
looking at that
sylveon<00:02:44.700> also<00:02:44.910> has<00:02:45.060> Baton<00:02:45.360> Pass<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> think

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
sylveon also has Baton Pass so I think

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.980 
sylveon also has Baton Pass so I think
it's<00:02:46.710> one<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.820> very<00:02:47.850> few<00:02:48.510> pokémon<00:02:48.960> that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
it's one of the very few pokémon that

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.650 
it's one of the very few pokémon that
can<00:02:49.140> psych<00:02:49.470> up<00:02:49.620> Baton<00:02:49.920> Pass<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.480> could

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
can psych up Baton Pass and that could

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.210 
can psych up Baton Pass and that could
be<00:02:51.750> another<00:02:52.050> crazy<00:02:52.410> strategy<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.070> just

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
be another crazy strategy if you just

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.290 
be another crazy strategy if you just
want<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.180> an

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
other than that moon blast is just too

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.180 
other than that moon blast is just too
strong<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.870> even<00:03:40.020> without<00:03:40.380> any<00:03:40.620> investment

they'll<00:03:41.430> probably<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.820> around<00:03:41.940> 300<00:03:42.450> special

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.870 
they'll probably have around 300 special
attack<00:03:43.290> which<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.980> still<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.610> good

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
attack which is still really good

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.790 
attack which is still really good
especially<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:45.870> getting<00:03:45.960> a<00:03:46.140> stab<00:03:46.440> move

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that almost has 100 power so I mean it

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
that almost has 100 power so I mean it
turns<00:03:49.560> into<00:03:49.770> a<00:03:49.890> vanilla<00:03:50.220> hyper<00:03:50.460> beam<00:03:50.730> from
