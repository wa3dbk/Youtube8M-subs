00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
now while holding down the shift key yes

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.830 
now while holding down the shift key yes
this<00:02:33.760> will<00:02:33.880> only<00:02:34.060> work<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.570> load<00:02:34.720> on<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
shift key then I just minimize it open

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.340 
shift key then I just minimize it open
closed<00:02:39.340> or<00:02:39.610> restore<00:02:40.270> any<00:02:40.510> window<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.020> Here<00:02:41.320> We

closed or restore any window and Here We

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800 
closed or restore any window and Here We
Go<00:02:41.440> I'm<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.860> minimize<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.720> we

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
Go I'm going to minimize it and there we

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 
Go I'm going to minimize it and there we
go<00:02:43.840> look<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> slow<00:02:44.710> motion<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.190> fact<00:02:45.340> right

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
go look with a slow motion of fact right

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.420 
go look with a slow motion of fact right
there<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:46.480> pretty<00:02:46.690> cool<00:02:46.840> isn't<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.140> now<00:02:48.010> once

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
there it's pretty cool isn't it now once

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.450 
there it's pretty cool isn't it now once
again<00:02:48.550> it's<00:02:48.880> not<00:02:49.060> something<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:50.110> would

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
again it's not something that you would

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.980 
again it's not something that you would
like<00:02:51.460> go<00:02:51.730> ahead<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.150> keep<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:54.780> yeah<00:02:55.780> it's

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
like go ahead and keep but yeah it's

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.450 
like go ahead and keep but yeah it's
just<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> cool<00:02:56.410> little<00:02:56.590> tweak<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.250> only

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
just a cool little tweak and this only

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.820 
just a cool little tweak and this only
works<00:02:58.060> if<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.390> hold<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.870> shift<00:02:58.900> key<00:02:59.200> see

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
works if you hold down the shift key see

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.590 
works if you hold down the shift key see
without<00:03:00.190> holding<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.730> shift<00:03:01.000> key<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
without holding the shift key is just

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.560
