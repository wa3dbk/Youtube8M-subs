00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.360
 hi girls then i'll do you today 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.190
 see all the shopping I've done 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.770
 in the last few days among other things 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.570
 I am particularly satisfied with the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.410
 candy bag furla that I took that between a 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.020
 I'll show you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.060
 but first I wanted to remind you that this 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.940
 Saturday 13 July I will be in Florence for 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.680
 meeting you all as you know is the last 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.830
 stage that we still do at the center 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.809
 italy so i will be firenze precisely on the 13th 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.670
 July from 15 onwards in the perfumery 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.079
 brothers and arrears of via scandicci 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 casting I can't wait to meet 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.430
 also you Florentine and Tuscan and all 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.559
 in short, you girls of the neighborhood do not 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.480
 always very excited when I am there 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.550
 matches and yellow on super bots 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.110
 fruit of the heart and tomorrow we leave 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.210
 precisely for florence then sum not 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.510
 I'm looking forward is the first thing I took 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.710
 this bear that as you can guess 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.450
 will use a value absolutely one 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.219
 souvenir of Rome also because it is one 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.500
 Loving City we were already several 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.420
 sometimes it is I am in love with 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.339
 rome so this time I had to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.469
 absolutely take me a souvenir 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.630
 this aspect I felt it was the thing 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.460
 prettier brands and all super 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.650
 soft and precisely to this t shirt 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.090
 very strong but we start those purchases 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.580
 through so then I'll show you the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.200
 fashion purchases then first thing 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.119
 I took is this eye contour cream 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.700
 I heard a lot about the closure 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.140
 very well it seems to be miraculous type e 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.240
 as lately my eye sockets 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 they are getting worse in the sense that I have to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.970
 put double ration of corruptor ho 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.860
 wanted to try this cream is so yes 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.380
 I have yet to start using it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.869
 so I 'll let you know but I really hope 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.350
 that it is miraculous as they say because of it 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.540
 I need 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.970
 then I went by myself and took two 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.619
 pigments then the first seems a little 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.909
 plus a lacquer for a ba look at it 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.920
 because it doesn't look like a 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.140
 powder product because the color 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.590
 very homogeneous 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.229
 and very small Italianized chrome 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.120
 I would say I really like this color 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.440
 and i like to use it when i do 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 miss a dark smokey black note 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.080
 on both ends of the eye then 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.360
 in the outer corner in the inner corner 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.209
 and then in the middle of the eyelid 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 I put this pigment is this and it 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.290
 I already do with the gold pigment I have 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.090
 which is very similar to this one though 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.070
 that I did n't use it but on a curious person 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 because I think it's a little bit more 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.180
 portable compared to their that I have that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 much more heated though with a point 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.140
 really very very cool light on 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 therefore, mobile eyelid vi 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.100
 I recommend these of these pigments 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.959
 chrome of me because they make their own 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.239
 figure the other pigment instead I have 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.910
 taken it is very shiny shining 9 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.800
 glitter hoso is I like it because it gives 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.140
 lots and lots of light even for a 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.300
 maybe a very natural make up is enough 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.160
 because thaci over a pigment like this e 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.800
 immediately becomes very bright like 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.600
 perfect for summer especially if 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.640
 you are both tanned 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.340
 pigments will be great and me 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.739
 unfortunately I'm not so lucky then 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.930
 that even in summer I remain white then 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.239
 I took this who you are as you know me 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.549
 I'm staring with nail art e 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.430
 especially these three times a lot 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.760
 it very taken the heart with air force 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.579
 many cures they are basically about 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.250
 these on the type of gift cards 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.739
 the metallic ones that lean on 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.010
 on the nail and then thanks to the glue that 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.570
 apply before removing them remains 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.250
 its precisely this metallic color 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.560
 on the nail are the ones I have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.480
 used today but I don't do it 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.459
 see the nails up close because the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.870
 result did not come out just like 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.060
 he hoped in the sense that I think I have 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.519
 no too much glue so I have to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.250
 to find again to test but the result me 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.230
 loved it just done then 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 in fact they are named want 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.230
 try again 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.110
 but in short I really like this idea 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.580
 because the nails become a lot too 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.170
 here very sbrilluccicose right 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.580
 take what they become that much 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.230
 milk in short it was you like it 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 indulge me with these input colors 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.910
 azzarelli and then other things I took 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.100
 since I had finished my makeup remover is 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.680
 in Italy seen with no 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.180
 makeup remover I wanted to try this del 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.660
 make up for ever 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.790
 the sen size that is precisely formulated for 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.989
 sensitive eyes and this I already have 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.120
 used precisely because I needed but 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.859
 I will not advance you still want 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.070
 use it for a while because I want to 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.390
 see how I find myself at the end e 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.169
 so maybe I'll talk to you later 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.500
 we'll see 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.570
 and then others so the more taken these le 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.620
 I found super super super second 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.140
 and are these in these shoes with the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.700
 hugo boss heel 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.940
 I immediately liked them because they are 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.680
 very simple black sums are elegant 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.350
 they are also very very comfortable between 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.320
 the other and then behind have these 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.180
 details with these balls too 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.880
 black so they are not too obvious 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.250
 too short, however, showy 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.080
 also like these details on the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.760
 back above the heel and I think they are 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.100
 very nice, in short, I'm finally 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.930
 wearing heels a little more myself 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.090
 and then we are finally the last one 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.740
 purchase I took the candy bag was the 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.450
 as we have mentioned before 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.970
 initially I wanted a color 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.760
 beautiful on and strong but then I thought 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.160
 that wearing maybe even one 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.419
 month a month and a half in summer and then no 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.010
 I would have touched her until the next 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.250
 year because if I took like a fuchsia 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.080
 a bright orange did n't seem to me 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.660
 very autumn colors or anyway 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.700
 portable throughout the year and so I have 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.490
 tried this color initially 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.710
 I didn't like it but trying it is me 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.630
 liked a lot and I tried it 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.700
 I produced precisely to wear so and 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.110
 I liked it a lot and more is a 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.240
 color that I can use all year round 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.550
 and therefore precisely this took if 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.860
 I am not mistaken it is the biggest model that 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.780
 there is and there are the discounts now too 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.460
 I found it 40 percent discounted 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.800
 so take a look if you want 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.900
 now in the shops before that 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.030
 finish all the colors and nothing 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.100
 girls this is everything for today 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.230
 I miss a huge arm, I expect to 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.050
 firenze this saturday july 13th 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.970
 I recommend a kiss but it has huge and us 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.300
 see you at the next hello video 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.160
 today I want to give them 3 naked palettes 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.260
 bay six which as you know are these 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.640
 safe building that by now you will know them 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.640
 all because they are very famous
