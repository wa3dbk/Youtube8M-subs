00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.990 

so<00:00:09.770> we<00:00:09.950> have<00:00:10.510> two<00:00:11.510> types<00:00:11.870> of<00:00:12.050> cables<00:00:12.590> here<00:00:13.040> this

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
so we have two types of cables here this

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.130 
so we have two types of cables here this
is<00:00:14.210> one<00:00:14.680> and<00:00:15.970> now<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.270> we're<00:00:17.510> going<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:17.960> make

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
is one and now but we're going to make

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.280 
is one and now but we're going to make
this<00:00:18.349> very<00:00:18.650> simple<00:00:18.830> table<00:00:19.730> this<00:00:20.599> one<00:00:20.840> here

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
this very simple table this one here

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.170 
this very simple table this one here
just<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.599> twist<00:00:23.599> I<00:00:23.960> am<00:00:24.860> using<00:00:25.130> this<00:00:25.489> yarn<00:00:25.849> this

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
just a twist I am using this yarn this

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.560 
just a twist I am using this yarn this
is<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.390> trick<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:27.020> found<00:00:27.849> so<00:00:28.849> like<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:29.329> that<00:00:29.540> I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
is a trick I found so like that that I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.049 
is a trick I found so like that that I
know<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:30.560> every<00:00:31.070> eight<00:00:31.309> rows<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:32.000> I

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
know that it's every eight rows that I

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.720 
know that it's every eight rows that I
want<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.599> do<00:00:32.780> it<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.170> passed<00:00:33.500> it<00:00:33.770> through<00:00:33.800> where

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
want to do it I passed it through where

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.750 
want to do it I passed it through where
I<00:00:34.760> twisted<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.870> then<00:00:36.829> I<00:00:36.980> know<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.250> I<00:00:37.460> have

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
I twisted it and then I know that I have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.710 
I twisted it and then I know that I have
one<00:00:38.120> two<00:00:38.630> three<00:00:39.320> four<00:00:39.890> five<00:00:40.430> six<00:00:40.910> seven<00:00:41.600> eight

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.770 
one two three four five six seven eight
rows<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:43.040> means<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.210> row<00:00:44.420> where

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
rows that means this is the row where

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.930 
rows that means this is the row where
I'm<00:00:44.990> going<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.620> be<00:00:45.770> twisting<00:00:46.810> we've<00:00:47.810> knit<00:00:48.940> two

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
I'm going to be twisting we've knit two

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.220 
I'm going to be twisting we've knit two
stitches<00:00:50.110> I<00:00:51.310> pour<00:00:52.310> them<00:00:52.750> before<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.170> do<00:00:54.800> my

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
stitches I pour them before I do my

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.720 
stitches I pour them before I do my
cable<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:58.640> now<00:00:58.880> I<00:00:59.210> will<00:00:59.560> twist<00:01:00.560> I<00:01:00.920> can<00:01:01.310> do<00:01:01.430> any

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
cable so now I will twist I can do any

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.990 
isn't it
and<00:03:21.230> this<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:24.170> cable<00:03:24.710> itself<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.790> is

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and this is the cable itself this is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.240 
and this is the cable itself this is
where<00:03:26.240> I<00:03:26.470> twisted<00:03:27.470> them<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> will<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.640> one

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
where I twisted them so I will have one

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.590 
where I twisted them so I will have one
two<00:03:31.250> three<00:03:33.580> four<00:03:36.370> they<00:03:37.370> do<00:03:37.670> appear<00:03:38.210> a<00:03:38.240> little

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
two three four they do appear a little

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.320 
two three four they do appear a little
bit<00:03:38.960> tight<00:03:39.350> because<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.860> twisted<00:03:40.760> them<00:03:40.970> so

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
bit tight because you twisted them so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.160 
bit tight because you twisted them so
the<00:03:41.600> stitches<00:03:42.170> are<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> little<00:03:42.860> bit<00:03:43.040> tight<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:45.140> I

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
the stitches are a little bit tight so I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.650 
the stitches are a little bit tight so I
have<00:03:45.560> my<00:03:45.740> eight<00:03:46.100> stitches<00:03:46.610> there<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:52.220> have

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
my two knit stitches these were all

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.610 
my two knit stitches these were all
pearls<00:03:57.110> or<00:03:58.010> purl<00:03:58.580> stitches<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.570> these<00:04:00.140> are<00:04:00.410> my

pearls or purl stitches and these are my

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.640 
pearls or purl stitches and these are my
two<00:04:00.680> knit<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:02.570> are<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.500> appear<00:04:04.100> like<00:04:05.650> purl

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650

two knit that are that appear like purl
on<00:04:07.070> the<00:04:07.340> other<00:04:07.489> side<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.360> that's<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.410> way<00:04:09.680> it

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
on the other side and that's the way it

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.500 
on the other side and that's the way it
looks<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.959> now<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> know<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:13.970> my

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
looks and now I know that this is my

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.190 
looks and now I know that this is my
first<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.890> my<00:04:16.040> second<00:04:16.580> row<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.450> know

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200
