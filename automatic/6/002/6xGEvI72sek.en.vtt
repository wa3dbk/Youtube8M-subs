00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 recoucou so here's a video that shows 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 a shoe that had passed in the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 milk actually and that was wiped and one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.549
 sees the difference between his side 1 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 right and the one just done in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 did I leave the other dipped because 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.250
 that she is a little more rigid and so 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.060
 I think she's going to have a little more 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 need of time what is besides the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.900
 left earth for the other pair that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.900
 are currently dipping which my sink 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 so yes you will tell you this one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 it is that there are similar 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.610
 well no, in fact all the difference she 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 is in the color of the leather inside 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.840
 and outside I'm shifting a little bit 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 and m what looks a little more like 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.270
 side 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 so we go on a shoe when 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.539
 same where they have me to the differences of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 color 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.260
 there we have a shoe that he could 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.049
 know the cscec ben it's still a little 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.630
 wet but we will wait until it dries 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:16.590
 before applying the universe it's very 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.810
 very important so the interior is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:26.960
 still as rigid as you can 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.960
 see this one I do that it remains what 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.140
 koi carp 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:45.220
 collard shut his mouth over what's it 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:47.920
 the ola ray will not be so tongue etc 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.730
 it's anything but it's 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.890
 hell what I want roundabout 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.140
 it's true it stays like that while 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.810
 this one I cards 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 the tongue I wood I want what 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.960
 so that's the passage in the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.870
 milk that gives us a shoe 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.950
 beautiful and even the sole she is 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.690
 all clean having found the son 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.820
 we can see it better now 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 see that it is a little yellow by the way 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.590
 we saw more blows his color at 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 start it is yellow it is a sewn 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.690
 goodyear it is yellow 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.430
 fucking iphone does not want to focus 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.920
 tuning to sell them in Corsican 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 only machine whose caen valenciennes 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.330
 mix that has not been soaked yet 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:55.810
 that's what the good Shaqif 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:59.580
 rangers so here I am doing a little 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.850
 comparative directly like that clears 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:09.400
 well yes you're boring a single wash and a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:16.030
 sole not wash we see right away 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.560
 the difference in hues remove even a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.550
 camera to understand that there is one 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.550
 which is darker than the other 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:34.250
 in short good time it's a success there 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.750
 will have more than to wear the sole 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.480
 in it is clean nickel 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.830
 there are more beasts the leather is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 softened in because that too 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.570
 it's important to be able to do 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.250
 foot in to see a leather tongue 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.850
 all rigid dance and a shot to make 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.830
 clubs 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:58.910
 so here's what we have a leather 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:05.540
 softened it is even more flexible 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.460
 that this one reads in his arms was 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.710
 attracted 7 votes so she deserves to 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.370
 pass in milk to say no to the pub 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.580
 hancock handle if I feel that this one 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.109
 is more flexible than my current boot I 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.420
 meaning that I'm going to spend them tidying this 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.460
 donate milk we will see to follow for the 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.930
 moment i am well in with them me 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.140
 seem a little tight but it's not 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.140
 very serious 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:40.960
 so that's comparative was done on 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.960
 will return the next shoe father 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.590
 and we really really see the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.590
 difference what
