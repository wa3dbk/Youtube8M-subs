will say on Tuesday I'm going to spend
four<00:01:14.790> hours<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.180> sorting<00:01:15.509> algorithms<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> find

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
four hours on sorting algorithms I find

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
four hours on sorting algorithms I find
the<00:01:16.619> second<00:01:16.950> method<00:01:17.070> works<00:01:17.430> better<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.729> me

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the second method works better for me

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
the second method works better for me
because<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> stops<00:01:18.659> me<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:18.840> being<00:01:19.140> lazy<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
because it stops me from being lazy and

working each day so that helps to keep
me<00:01:23.250> motivated<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.939> common<00:01:24.330> problem<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
me motivated a common problem is the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
me motivated a common problem is the
plan<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.409> too<00:01:25.590> ambitious<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
plan will be too ambitious because it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
plan will be too ambitious because it's
hard<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> know<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> advance<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.720> long<00:01:27.900> things

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
hard to know in advance how long things

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
hard to know in advance how long things
will<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:29.130> much<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.520> you'll<00:01:29.759> have

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
will take and how much time you'll have

will take and how much time you'll have
so<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.810> prepared<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> change<00:01:31.770> the

have time to refine it I did the same

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.170 
have time to refine it I did the same
with<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.650> level<00:05:04.950> computing<00:05:05.460> these<00:05:05.610> started<00:05:06.060> out

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
with a level computing these started out

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960 
with a level computing these started out
as<00:05:06.450> revision<00:05:07.020> notes<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.640> now<00:05:08.640> this<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.910> a

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
to be particularly useful in the exam

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.610 
to be particularly useful in the exam
and<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.270> probably<00:06:12.540> forget<00:06:12.960> it<00:06:13.110> anyway<00:06:13.200> a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
and you probably forget it anyway a

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.200 
and you probably forget it anyway a
decision<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.370> might<00:06:14.520> be<00:06:14.610> making<00:06:14.760> is<00:06:15.030> whether

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
decision you might be making is whether

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.450 
decision you might be making is whether
the<00:06:15.390> type<00:06:15.600> or<00:06:15.750> handwrite<00:06:16.140> your<00:06:16.260> notes<00:06:16.440> and<00:06:16.650> I'd

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
the type or handwrite your notes and I'd

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.550 
the type or handwrite your notes and I'd
say<00:06:17.760> based<00:06:17.970> this<00:06:18.240> on<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.540> type<00:06:18.780> of<00:06:18.810> content<00:06:19.350> I

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
say based this on the type of content I

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.590 
say based this on the type of content I
can<00:06:19.770> type<00:06:20.160> faster<00:06:20.460> than<00:06:20.820> I<00:06:20.880> can<00:06:21.090> write<00:06:21.270> by<00:06:21.570> hand

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
can type faster than I can write by hand

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.510 
can type faster than I can write by hand
so<00:06:22.230> if<00:06:22.350> I<00:06:22.440> know<00:06:22.500> my<00:06:22.770> notes<00:06:22.980> are<00:06:23.160> going<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.370> be

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
so if I know my notes are going to be

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.610 
so if I know my notes are going to be
almost<00:06:23.730> completely<00:06:24.090> made<00:06:24.600> up<00:06:24.750> of<00:06:24.930> sentences

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
almost completely made up of sentences

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.830 
almost completely made up of sentences
and<00:06:25.740> words<00:06:25.890> I'll<00:06:26.220> type<00:06:26.820> them<00:06:27.030> if<00:06:27.150> my<00:06:27.480> revision

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
and words I'll type them if my revision

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.630 
and words I'll type them if my revision
notes<00:06:27.960> on<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.350> other<00:06:28.500> hand<00:06:28.680> are<00:06:28.950> going<00:06:29.310> to<00:06:29.490> be

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
notes on the other hand are going to be

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.280 
notes on the other hand are going to be
made<00:06:29.820> up<00:06:29.940> of<00:06:30.060> maths<00:06:30.360> and<00:06:30.660> diagrams<00:06:30.990> and

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
made up of maths and diagrams and

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.080 
made up of maths and diagrams and
equations<00:06:31.380> then<00:06:32.340> I'm<00:06:32.580> going<00:06:32.790> to<00:06:32.850> write<00:06:32.970> them

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
equations then I'm going to write them

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.640 
equations then I'm going to write them
by<00:06:33.210> hand<00:06:33.450> because<00:06:33.810> typing<00:06:34.230> maths

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
by hand because typing maths

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.710 
by hand because typing maths
takes<00:06:35.190> a<00:06:35.340> long<00:06:35.460> time<00:06:35.490> if<00:06:35.940> you<00:06:36.210> choose<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.420> type

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
takes a long time if you choose to type

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.970 
takes a long time if you choose to type
you<00:06:36.840> know<00:06:36.960> to<00:06:37.170> avoid<00:06:37.230> copying<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:37.860> pasting

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
you know to avoid copying and pasting

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.590 
you know to avoid copying and pasting
things<00:06:38.400> because<00:06:38.820> you're<00:06:39.060> not<00:06:39.180> going<00:06:39.390> to<00:06:39.510> learn
