00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.219
 some things in switzerland are great and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.400
 others are smaller like the famous chair 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.580
 land or train station clock 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.919
 both are classics of Swiss design 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.380
 the Zurich Design Museum has one of the 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.449
 larger collections of these objects 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.699
 they were designed to make life 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.159
 at the same time more beautiful and 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.420
 simple what they typically have 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:36.850
 I would say that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.130
 the swiss design is a little dry and more 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.500
 simple and less elegant than the design 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.690
 Italian for example he is minimalist and 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.120
 perhaps more focused on quality than 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.600
 in beauty it focuses on detail in the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.970
 exact precision of anger that's 18 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.280
 but it often shows a 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.100
 high level of technical refinement in its 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.620
 simplicity to your graphic design

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.160

 easy-to-read functional layout and 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 well-structured functionality the type of 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.530
