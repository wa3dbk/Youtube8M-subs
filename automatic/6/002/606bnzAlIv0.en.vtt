00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
assumption looking at that would be the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.920 
assumption looking at that would be the
woman<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:33.970> gone<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.570> minute<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
woman has gone on for a minute and a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500

half<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.380> as<00:02:35.530> sincerely<00:02:36.430> felt<00:02:36.880> as<00:02:37.090> her<00:02:37.240> pain

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
half and as sincerely felt as her pain

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.140 
half and as sincerely felt as her pain
obviously<00:02:38.050> was<00:02:38.230> she<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.430> little<00:02:39.760> hard<00:02:39.970> to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
obviously was she was a little hard to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.570 
obviously was she was a little hard to
follow<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.720> maybe<00:02:41.050> he<00:02:41.500> wasn't<00:02:41.770> listening<00:02:42.430> at

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
and listen to the McCain campaign that

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.810 
and listen to the McCain campaign that
clearly<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.950> doubling<00:03:12.310> down<00:03:12.460> on<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.670> Nash

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
clearly is doubling down on the Nash

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.130 
clearly is doubling down on the Nash
security<00:03:13.270> message<00:03:13.570> they<00:03:13.690> really<00:03:13.930> want<00:03:14.080> to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
security message they really want to

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.230 
security message they really want to
make<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.350> election<00:03:14.860> about<00:03:15.430> Nash<00:03:15.670> security<00:03:16.210> I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
make this election about Nash security I

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.030 
make this election about Nash security I
don't<00:03:16.540> think<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.780> was<00:03:16.930> simply<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.290> gaff<00:03:17.530> gaff

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
don't think this was simply a gaff gaff

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.250 
don't think this was simply a gaff gaff
I<00:03:18.370> think<00:03:18.610> this<00:03:18.730> actually<00:03:18.910> was<00:03:19.330> John<00:03:19.930> McCain

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
I think this actually was John McCain

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
I think this actually was John McCain
telling<00:03:20.770> people<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> truth<00:03:21.160> about<00:03:21.580> where<00:03:21.760> he

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
telling people the truth about where he

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.000 
telling people the truth about where he
stands<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.900> that's<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.350> case<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.860> you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
stands and if that's the case and you

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.160 
stands and if that's the case and you
put<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.460> context<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.300> all<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> saber

Obama he wants to finish the wars we
have<00:03:37.990> ongoing<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.490> that<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.880> a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
have ongoing and I think that is a

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.480 
have ongoing and I think that is a
really<00:03:40.390> telling<00:03:41.260> statement<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.310> think

already<00:04:58.000> fought<00:04:58.360> too<00:04:58.630> many<00:04:58.810> wars<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.260> we

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
already fought too many wars that we

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.900 
already fought too many wars that we
didn't<00:04:59.590> need<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.770> fight<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.550> seems<00:05:00.790> that

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
didn't need to fight and it seems that

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.970 
didn't need to fight and it seems that
John<00:05:01.210> McCain<00:05:01.330> wants<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> fight<00:05:02.170> more<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.740> more

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
John McCain wants to fight more and more

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.310 
John McCain wants to fight more and more
I<00:05:03.010> mean<00:05:03.160> this<00:05:03.400> is<00:05:03.460> again<00:05:04.120> an<00:05:04.390> incredibly

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
I mean this is again an incredibly

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.750 
I mean this is again an incredibly
telling<00:05:05.800> statement<00:05:05.980> I<00:05:06.220> think<00:05:06.430> gives<00:05:06.640> you<00:05:06.730> a

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
telling statement I think gives you a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270 
telling statement I think gives you a
picture<00:05:07.060> into<00:05:07.390> who<00:05:07.720> John<00:05:08.020> McCain<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.770> what

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
picture into who John McCain is in what

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.070 
picture into who John McCain is in what
he<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.580> believes<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.300> what<00:05:10.570> he<00:05:10.750> would<00:05:10.900> do

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
he really believes and what he would do

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.690 
he really believes and what he would do
if<00:05:11.350> he<00:05:11.380> was<00:05:11.620> president<00:05:12.100> one<00:05:12.460> other<00:05:12.580> point

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
if he was president one other point

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.910 
if he was president one other point
about<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.390> because<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:14.560> Pentagon

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
about this because the Pentagon

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.130 
about this because the Pentagon
essentially<00:05:15.310> endorsed<00:05:15.730> Obama's<00:05:16.510> Afghanistan

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
essentially endorsed Obama's Afghanistan

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.560 
essentially endorsed Obama's Afghanistan
solution<00:05:17.710> as<00:05:17.860> this<00:05:18.010> suggests<00:05:18.330> Obama<00:05:19.330> doesn't

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
solution as this suggests Obama doesn't

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.450 
solution as this suggests Obama doesn't
have<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.870> military<00:05:20.440> judgment<00:05:20.890> problem<00:05:21.130> he<00:05:21.250> has

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
have a military judgment problem he has

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.120 
have a military judgment problem he has
a<00:05:21.760> John<00:05:22.240> McCain<00:05:22.600> lies<00:05:22.870> about<00:05:23.230> him<00:05:23.470> problem<00:05:23.950> and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
a John McCain lies about him problem and

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.720 
a John McCain lies about him problem and
the<00:05:24.670> polling<00:05:25.090> suggests<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.500> lies<00:05:26.710> work<00:05:27.070> how

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
the polling suggests the lies work how

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.970 
the polling suggests the lies work how
does<00:05:27.910> he<00:05:28.000> counter<00:05:28.330> them<00:05:28.590> well<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> think<00:05:29.800> he

does he counter them well I think he

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.890 
does he counter them well I think he
needs<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.250> go<00:05:30.400> on<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.880> offensive<00:05:31.390> nationally
