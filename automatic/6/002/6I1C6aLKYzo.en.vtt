flower this is one that's fairly old and
it<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:10.740> almost<00:00:11.010> dead<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.790> brought<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.210> back

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
it was almost dead and I brought it back

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.300 
it was almost dead and I brought it back
somebody<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.650> getting<00:00:13.740> rid<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:16.310> here's

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
somebody was getting rid of it here's

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.810 
somebody was getting rid of it here's
one<00:00:17.720> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.779> got<00:00:19.500> from<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.859> friend<00:00:19.890> originally

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
one that I got from a friend originally

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.840 
one that I got from a friend originally
I<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.060> looking<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.189> I<00:00:23.189> cut<00:00:23.460> back<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I was looking at it and I cut back the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
I was looking at it and I cut back the
leaves<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> branches<00:00:25.410> fairly

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
leaves or the branches fairly

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.970 
leaves or the branches fairly
significantly<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.590> thinking<00:00:28.859> about

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
significantly and I was thinking about

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.939 
significantly and I was thinking about
using<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.789> bonsai<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.920> then<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
using this for bonsai and then I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.180 
using this for bonsai and then I
realized<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.510> reality<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.980> base

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
realized that in reality that the base

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.799 
realized that in reality that the base
of<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.550> tree<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.870> stem<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.809> don't

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
of this tree the stem it just I don't

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.479 
of this tree the stem it just I don't
know<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> bonsai<00:00:40.500> tree<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.340> almost

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
know if at the bonsai tree it almost

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
know if at the bonsai tree it almost
looks<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:42.120> thin<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> spindle<00:00:43.620> II<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
looks too thin and spindle II but it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
looks too thin and spindle II but it
will<00:00:46.050> probably<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> beautiful<00:00:47.160> plant

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
will probably be a beautiful plant

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.029 
will probably be a beautiful plant
nonetheless<00:00:48.710> however<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:55.039> see

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
nonetheless however we have this see

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
nonetheless however we have this see
it's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> very<00:00:56.280> spindle<00:00:57.059> thorny<00:00:57.600> plant<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it's a very spindle thorny plant this is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010 
it's a very spindle thorny plant this is
also<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.920> bogan<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> this<00:01:00.120> tree<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.390> about<00:01:00.539> 50

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
also a bogan be it this tree is about 50

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.760 
also a bogan be it this tree is about 50
years<00:01:01.260> old<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.439> I<00:01:04.439> dug<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.060> its<00:01:06.060> roots<00:01:06.420> were

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
years old and I dug it up its roots were

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
years old and I dug it up its roots were
extensive<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.310> were<00:01:08.369> God<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.479> four

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
extensive they were God there were four

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
extensive they were God there were four
inches<00:01:10.020> wide<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.890> cases<00:01:11.310> most<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> these

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
inches wide some cases most of these

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.310 
inches wide some cases most of these
Reed's<00:01:12.299> were<00:01:12.450> tap<00:01:12.659> roots<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.260> were

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
Reed's were tap roots and they were

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.590 
Reed's were tap roots and they were
completely<00:01:13.830> useless<00:01:14.150> but<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> tree<00:01:15.420> had

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
completely useless but the tree had

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
completely useless but the tree had
quite<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> few<00:01:18.680> basically<00:01:19.680> feeder<00:01:19.920> roots<00:01:20.159> near

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
quite a few basically feeder roots near

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.230 
quite a few basically feeder roots near
the<00:01:20.670> base<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.560> down<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.939> right<00:01:23.939> near<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the base of it down a right near the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.580 
the base of it down a right near the
base<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.750> had<00:01:24.869> no<00:01:24.990> problem<00:01:25.020> cutting

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
base of it so I had no problem cutting

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.359 
base of it so I had no problem cutting
off<00:01:25.830> most<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> major<00:01:27.330> roots<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.369> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
off most of the major roots and I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.359 
off most of the major roots and I
replaced<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> into<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> big<00:01:30.930> bin<00:01:31.590> container

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
replaced it into this big bin container

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.890 
replaced it into this big bin container
here<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.570> heavy<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:36.060> try<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
here it's heavy to try and get it to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
here it's heavy to try and get it to
grow<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> cut

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
grow back out because you can see I cut

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
grow back out because you can see I cut
well<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.540> most<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> foliage<00:01:40.409> off

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
well pretty much most of the foliage off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.719 
well pretty much most of the foliage off
of<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.420> but<00:01:42.420> um<00:01:42.770> since<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.130> done<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
of it but um since I have done so you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.210 
of it but um since I have done so you
can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.299> along<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.740> tons<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
can see all along here there are tons of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.490 
can see all along here there are tons of
these<00:01:47.340> new<00:01:47.790> growths<00:01:48.170> coming<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.439> over

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
these new growths coming out all over

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
these new growths coming out all over
the<00:01:49.829> plant<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.850> realized<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.540> lot

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the plant and I realized there's a lot

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
the plant and I realized there's a lot
of<00:01:54.899> stump<00:01:55.409> looking<00:01:56.040> areas<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.579> cut<00:01:56.729> off

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of stump looking areas that are cut off

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.069 
of stump looking areas that are cut off
here<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> still<00:01:59.100> feel<00:01:59.840> considering<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
here but I still feel considering this

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.749 
here but I still feel considering this
trees<00:02:01.439> size<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.399> age<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:04.759> really

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
trees size and age that it has really

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.380 
trees size and age that it has really
potential<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:07.140> bonsai<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.940> almost<00:02:09.119> feel

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
potential for bonsai and I almost feel

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.809 
potential for bonsai and I almost feel
like<00:02:09.450> I'm<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.140> talented<00:02:10.679> enough<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.220> give

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
like I'm not talented enough to give

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.710 
like I'm not talented enough to give
this<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.510> piece<00:02:12.780> its<00:02:13.080> justice

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720

backside<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.530> bub<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:30.860> out<00:02:31.860> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
backside of this little bub here out of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.509 
backside of this little bub here out of
there<00:02:33.170> there's<00:02:34.170> also<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:34.709> well<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
there there's also some well out of the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.600 
there there's also some well out of the
backside<00:02:35.970> over<00:02:36.239> here<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.340> as<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.550> see

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
backside over here and as you can see

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.360 
backside over here and as you can see
there's<00:02:38.970> quite<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.510> few<00:02:39.630> out<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.890> top<00:02:41.099> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
there's quite a few out of the top of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.229 
there's quite a few out of the top of
this<00:02:41.549> plan<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:46.220> mean<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.610> obviously<00:02:47.849> needs

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
this plan so I mean it obviously needs

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.089 
this plan so I mean it obviously needs
to<00:02:48.599> be<00:02:48.750> left<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.319> grow<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> bit<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.769> means

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
to be left to grow a bit and this means

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.199 
to be left to grow a bit and this means
something<00:02:53.489> needs<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.760> done<00:02:53.819> with<00:02:54.120> this

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
something needs to be done with this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.870 
something needs to be done with this
weather<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> needs<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:54.959> hollowed<00:02:55.319> out<00:02:55.440> and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
weather it needs to be hollowed out and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.680 
weather it needs to be hollowed out and
this<00:02:56.880> up<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.819> I<00:02:59.849> still<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.390> again

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
this up here but I still think again

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.180 
this up here but I still think again
this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> very<00:03:01.260> good<00:03:01.530> candidate<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
this is a very good candidate for a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.449 
this is a very good candidate for a
bonsai<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.329> actually<00:03:03.480> do<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.019> an<00:03:04.280> 18<00:03:05.280> inch

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
bonsai I actually do you have an 18 inch

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.000 
bonsai I actually do you have an 18 inch
pot<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.739> can<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:09.480> plant<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
pot that I can use for this plant in the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.300 
pot that I can use for this plant in the
future<00:03:11.400> whenever<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:13.069> may<00:03:14.069> be

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
future whenever that may be

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.870 
future whenever that may be
I<00:03:14.720> can<00:03:16.790> transplant<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.389> that<00:03:18.540> pot<00:03:19.880> but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
I can transplant this into that pot but

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.390 
I can transplant this into that pot but
one<00:03:21.030> thing<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.359> failing<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.019> able<00:03:22.079> to

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
one thing I'm failing to be able to

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.120 
one thing I'm failing to be able to
grasp<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:24.389> exactly<00:03:25.170> what<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.530> should<00:03:25.859> do<00:03:25.980> with

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
grasp is exactly what I should do with

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.180 
grasp is exactly what I should do with
it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
it

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.890 
it
you<00:03:29.190> know<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.310> could<00:03:29.760> see<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.359> top<00:03:30.540> here

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
you know I could see at the top here

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.809 
you know I could see at the top here
this<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.470> one<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> these<00:03:31.920> three<00:03:32.280> branches<00:03:32.459> is

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
this is one of these three branches is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.150 
this is one of these three branches is
definitely<00:03:33.420> going<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.660> be<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:34.019> necessity<00:03:34.739> in

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
definitely going to be a necessity in

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.250 
definitely going to be a necessity in
this<00:03:35.850> trees<00:03:36.889> formation<00:03:39.019> probably<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> lot<00:03:40.230> of

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
this trees formation probably a lot of

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.949 
this trees formation probably a lot of
wiring<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.359> see<00:03:42.510> there's<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.720> whole<00:03:42.870> bunch

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
wiring you can see there's a whole bunch

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.420 
wiring you can see there's a whole bunch
of<00:03:43.109> little<00:03:43.350> side<00:03:43.530> branches<00:03:43.980> coming<00:03:44.190> off<00:03:44.370> of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
of little side branches coming off of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.620 
of little side branches coming off of
them<00:03:44.850> new<00:03:45.299> shoots<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.500> should<00:03:46.680> fill<00:03:46.889> out

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
them new shoots so that should fill out

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.690 
them new shoots so that should fill out
but<00:03:48.630> I'm<00:03:48.750> wondering<00:03:49.100> whether<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.220> should<00:03:50.340> just

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
but I'm wondering whether I should just

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.210 
but I'm wondering whether I should just
keep<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.359> these<00:03:51.660> take<00:03:52.590> one<00:03:52.829> of<00:03:52.950> them<00:03:53.100> off

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
keep one of these take one of them off

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.970 
keep one of these take one of them off
take<00:03:53.609> two<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.850> them<00:03:54.090> off<00:03:54.530> I'll<00:03:55.530> keep<00:03:55.799> all<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
take two of them off I'll keep all of

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.039 
take two of them off I'll keep all of
them<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.400> wire<00:03:56.970> them<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.329> their<00:03:57.450> own<00:03:57.569> special

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
them and wire them in their own special

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.990 
them and wire them in their own special
and<00:03:58.170> individual<00:03:58.650> way<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.250> fill<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.609> tree<00:03:59.849> out

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
and individual way to fill the tree out

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.479 
and individual way to fill the tree out
and<00:04:00.349> whether<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.440> should<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> wiring<00:04:02.130> now

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
and whether I should do the wiring now

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.479 
and whether I should do the wiring now
or<00:04:02.819> wait<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.630> grow<00:04:03.780> out<00:04:03.959> some<00:04:04.230> more<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
or wait for it to grow out some more the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.160 
or wait for it to grow out some more the
trees<00:04:05.700> obviously<00:04:06.150> been<00:04:06.569> put<00:04:06.750> under<00:04:06.840> quite<00:04:07.109> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
trees obviously been put under quite a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.900 
trees obviously been put under quite a
bit<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.440> stress<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:07.920> these<00:04:08.069> Bookmen<00:04:08.609> v<00:04:08.730> are

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
bit of stress but these Bookmen v are

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.930 
bit of stress but these Bookmen v are
almost<00:04:09.299> unkillable<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:10.730> think<00:04:11.730> it'd<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.849> easier

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
almost unkillable I think it'd be easier

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.240 
almost unkillable I think it'd be easier
to<00:04:12.419> wire<00:04:12.599> now<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.049> there<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.260> no<00:04:13.380> foliage<00:04:13.950> or

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
to wire now that there is no foliage or

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.180 
to wire now that there is no foliage or
major<00:04:14.880> branching<00:04:15.419> occurring<00:04:15.979> but<00:04:16.979> at<00:04:17.099> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
major branching occurring but at the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.979 
major branching occurring but at the
same<00:04:17.370> time<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> still<00:04:18.060> have<00:04:18.299> yet<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.510> be<00:04:18.750> able<00:04:18.780> to

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
same time I still have yet to be able to

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.820 
same time I still have yet to be able to
picture<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.919> tree<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:21.989> again<00:04:22.440> I'll<00:04:22.590> give<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
picture this tree so again I'll give it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.770 
picture this tree so again I'll give it
a<00:04:22.890> wide<00:04:23.099> shot<00:04:23.400> there's<00:04:24.000> some<00:04:24.210> more<00:04:24.360> clusters

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
a wide shot there's some more clusters

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.880 
a wide shot there's some more clusters
of<00:04:24.900> branches<00:04:25.260> I'm<00:04:25.409> wondering<00:04:25.680> whether<00:04:25.830> I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
of branches I'm wondering whether I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.770 
of branches I'm wondering whether I
should<00:04:26.010> keep<00:04:26.310> some<00:04:26.580> remove<00:04:26.880> some<00:04:27.150> how<00:04:27.390> exact

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
should keep some remove some how exact

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.920 
should keep some remove some how exact
I<00:04:27.810> should<00:04:28.139> go<00:04:28.230> about<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:29.690> an<00:04:30.690> interesting

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I should go about this an interesting

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.810 
I should go about this an interesting
feature<00:04:31.410> right<00:04:31.710> there<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:32.639> there's

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
feature right there and then there's

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.620 
feature right there and then there's
some<00:04:33.090> some<00:04:33.360> more<00:04:33.510> branching<00:04:35.240> again<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.419> tree

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
some some more branching again this tree
