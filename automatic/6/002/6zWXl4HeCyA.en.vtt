00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
gun has got a fire selector but I'm not

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
gun has got a fire selector but I'm not
sure<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.299> gun<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.079> older

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
