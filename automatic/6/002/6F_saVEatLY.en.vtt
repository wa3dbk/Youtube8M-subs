00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.400
 very good to all the kids I am 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.009
 virus and after a long time without 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.510
 upload videos I bring a tutorial this time 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.870
 is a tutorial of a mini game of 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.510
 redstone created exclusively by me and 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.780
 I called it billiards because it would be a 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.780
 game similar to billiards 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.630
 and mainly what it does is to press 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.340
 the button to start books melo de 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.700
 carvalho 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.460
 that's not all in my plans 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.560
 by pressing the start button of two 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.410
 dispensers fall blocks that could 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 be the object that you want and we will have 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 have to push them by pressing these buttons 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.480
 with water until you reach the two holes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.500
 once a block enters each hole 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.680
 will not loose an award this game is not 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.720
 that is too useful for the simple 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.730
 player but with the multiplayer you can 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.280
 costar can be pretty fun or 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.170
 for an adventure map as you see if 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.050
 press this button opens the piston of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.600
 underneath if we press again it turns to 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610
 open what I want is to push the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.200
 block if I keep it tight so that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.650
 the water is all the time with the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.650
 current 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.080
 and I do not know why it's not going 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.370
 uy let's see if he's quiet 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.230
 as you see the block has fallen and if you 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.050
 we make the other block also like this 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.520
 here's an award prize 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.680
 you can put whatever you want I have put 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.440
 Here in development SOS 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.510
 release them saving and we will see a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.900
 little circuits and I tell you that they are 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.780
 fairly easy redstone circuits 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.360
 to imagine, it's easy that I've done 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.460
 even I can do it anybody 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.440
 it is very difficult if not 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.890
 understand it simply as copy 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.890
 the design 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.110
 to begin with I made the circuits of 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.050
 three colors dividing the button in blue 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.380
 to start the yellows of the pistons 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.439
 so that the water goes down and the red is 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.120
 prize 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.280
 as I did the button to start then 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.200
 very easy in the gold block is the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.170
 button with what when I put it sends the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.659
 Repsol signal up here with a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.879
 repeater so that it lengthens even more and 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.639
 comes to this dispenser that has 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.469
 blue anus blocks still around here with 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.109
 most repeated is up to this other 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.359
 dispenser with red wool what it does is 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.569
 drop the wool loose a block of each 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.060
 dispenser 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.879
 then the blocks so that you lower the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.280
 piston and drop the water I made them 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.120
 putting wool over here with redstone that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.189
 come down and start this lit torch 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.439
 turn on this reaction here and 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.010
 then turn off I'll be here is and is 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.510
 off we put an inverter is very easy 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.579
 to do as you see is network hides a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.439
 block and a torch with what 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.450
 keeps the piston on when 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.120
 press the button this lights up with 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.620
 what invests everything and in the end this 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.110
 it ends off and the water falls 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.330
 and this what I just explained to you 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.849
 you have to do with all the buttons 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.810
 As you can see, there are three here 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.110
 more over here four more and here others 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.110
 three 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.760
 now when the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.250
 the blocks as you see what I've done is 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.470
 put a ladder because that way the water does not 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.710
 low but low that water too 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.710
 and what happens is going on is 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.250
 wood place pressure lights here to 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.780
 the redstone and this torch is paid 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.410
 here the same thing happened as you see if 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 was one without falling would ignite a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.750
 torch to what would light this and it's 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.460
 so much that from here it would go out and send 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.600
 redstone over here 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.590
 that would end off 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.950
 instead 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.920
 if we put this like this 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.560
 that is lit this here is paid 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.410
 and this lights up with what up the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.549
 network are 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.000
 it will come on 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.320
 and then release the prize 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.930
 as you see it is very easy to do no 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.580
 Well this is has been another by the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.460
 blocks that I been putting under on 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.350
 the prisoners place is something very easy to 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.690
 do what you can do in creative 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.820
 perfectly the blocks and it's all 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.070
 blocks of stone and wood and so you can 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.290
 use the ones you want 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.960
 and nothing I hope you liked the 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.590
 tutorial that you make your villares in 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.270
 servers or adventure maps and from here 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.900
 favorites helps a lot and even the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.900
 next video
