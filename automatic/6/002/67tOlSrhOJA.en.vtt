00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
quad can fly with how good can it be at

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.909

this<00:00:28.759> ice<00:00:28.970> well<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:29.929> seems<00:00:30.140> very<00:00:30.259> solid<00:00:30.769> I'll

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
this ice well it seems very solid I'll

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.610 
this ice well it seems very solid I'll
build<00:00:31.399> for<00:00:31.579> abuse<00:00:31.930> however<00:00:32.930> it's<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.320> bit<00:00:33.440> heavy

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
build for abuse however it's a bit heavy

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.100 
build for abuse however it's a bit heavy
it<00:00:34.130> is<00:00:34.700> stable<00:00:35.090> enough<00:00:35.270> but<00:00:35.810> a<00:00:35.840> bit

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
it is stable enough but a bit

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.020 
it is stable enough but a bit
unpredictable<00:00:36.410> trimming<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.490> quad<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.850> keep

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
unpredictable trimming the quad to keep

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.620 
unpredictable trimming the quad to keep
it<00:00:38.120> from<00:00:38.270> drifting<00:00:38.780> does<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:39.290> always<00:00:39.470> work

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
it from drifting does not always work

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.760 
it from drifting does not always work
you<00:00:41.630> can<00:00:41.810> trim<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:42.290> these<00:00:42.410> albums<00:00:44.770> very

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
you can trim it with these albums very

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.560 
you can trim it with these albums very
often<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.310> quad<00:00:46.520> starts<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:47.030> drift<00:00:47.270> forward

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
often the quad starts to drift forward

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.780 
often the quad starts to drift forward
and<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.350> am<00:00:48.440> NOT<00:00:48.590> able<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.890> retrieve<00:00:49.370> it<00:00:49.520> but

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
and I am NOT able to retrieve it but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.080 
and I am NOT able to retrieve it but
only<00:00:49.940> slow<00:00:50.450> down<00:00:50.720> its<00:00:50.930> forward<00:00:51.230> momentum<00:00:51.380> I

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
only slow down its forward momentum I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.940 
only slow down its forward momentum I
then<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.360> power<00:00:53.750> cycle<00:00:53.990> the<00:00:54.200> quad<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.710> it

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
then have to power cycle the quad and it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.850 
then have to power cycle the quad and it
flies<00:00:55.130> normal<00:00:55.550> again<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.320> brother<00:00:57.320> does<00:00:57.650> not

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
flies normal again I brother does not

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.090 
flies normal again I brother does not
experience<00:00:58.220> these<00:00:58.579> problems<00:00:59.060> with<00:00:59.329> his<00:00:59.480> quad

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
experience these problems with his quad

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.680 
experience these problems with his quad
if<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.250> push<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.610> left<00:01:01.820> stick<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:02.510> can

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
if you push the left stick in you can

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.749 
if you push the left stick in you can
choose<00:01:02.900> from<00:01:03.140> three<00:01:03.770> different<00:01:04.040> sensitivity

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
choose from three different sensitivity

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.359 
choose from three different sensitivity
settings<00:01:05.210> if<00:01:06.109> you<00:01:06.350> pushed<00:01:06.560> right<00:01:06.890> stick<00:01:07.189> in

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
settings if you pushed right stick in

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.090 
settings if you pushed right stick in
you<00:01:07.880> can<00:01:08.060> set<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.270> into<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.569> flip<00:01:08.840> mode<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.950> that

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
you can set it into a flip mode and that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.190 
you can set it into a flip mode and that
mode<00:01:10.280> is<00:01:10.429> activated<00:01:10.789> you<00:01:11.060> can<00:01:11.090> control<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.840> but

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
mode is activated you can control it but

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.630 
mode is activated you can control it but
when<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.499> move<00:01:12.679> the<00:01:12.799> right<00:01:13.009> stick<00:01:13.280> all<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
when you move the right stick all the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.999 
when you move the right stick all the
way<00:01:13.759> in<00:01:14.390> any<00:01:14.600> direction<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.380> will<00:01:15.530> perform<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
way in any direction it will perform a

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.010 
way in any direction it will perform a
flip<00:01:16.189> I<00:01:16.520> would<00:01:17.270> prefer<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:17.749> you<00:01:17.840> could<00:01:17.990> just

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
flip I would prefer if you could just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.139 
flip I would prefer if you could just
set<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.439> sensitivity<00:01:18.590> high<00:01:19.249> enough<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
set the sensitivity high enough so you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.660 
set the sensitivity high enough so you
could<00:01:20.299> perform<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.749> flip<00:01:20.899> yourself<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:22.460> takes

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
could perform the flip yourself it takes

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.969 
could perform the flip yourself it takes
15<00:01:23.389> minutes<00:01:23.749> to<00:01:23.899> charge<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.619> they<00:01:24.710> get<00:01:24.859> about

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
15 minutes to charge and they get about

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.919 
15 minutes to charge and they get about
four<00:01:25.310> minutes<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.639> flight<00:01:25.880> time<00:01:25.909> since<00:01:26.749> the

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
four minutes of flight time since the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.719 
four minutes of flight time since the
