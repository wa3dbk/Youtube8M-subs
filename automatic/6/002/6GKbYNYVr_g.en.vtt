00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
leaves up in it and if this was like an

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.820 
leaves up in it and if this was like an
afterthought<00:01:07.450> but<00:01:07.510> at<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.900> same<00:01:08.140> time<00:01:08.470> it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
afterthought but at the same time it

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.920 
afterthought but at the same time it
turned<00:01:09.310> out<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.460> be<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> good<00:01:09.940> thing<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.810> at

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.780 
they're curling down so we'll tip tip
them<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.390> way<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:37.069> bend<00:02:38.069> them<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.550> other

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
them this way and bend them to the other

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.300 
them this way and bend them to the other
way<00:02:39.709> there<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:43.640> see<00:02:44.640> their<00:02:44.819> curling<00:02:46.310> faster

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
way there we go see their curling faster

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.260 
way there we go see their curling faster
than<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:48.380> cope<00:02:49.380> with<00:02:49.590> them<00:02:49.800> here<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
than I can cope with them here and it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.030 
than I can cope with them here and it
doesn't<00:02:51.510> matter<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.260> know<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.440> want<00:02:52.800> them<00:02:52.980> to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
doesn't matter you know you want them to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.320 
doesn't matter you know you want them to
look<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:54.030> real<00:02:55.520> plants<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.640> real

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
look like like real plants and real

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.790 
look like like real plants and real
plants<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.560> leaves<00:02:58.770> are<00:02:58.980> never<00:02:59.190> perfect<00:03:00.800> they

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
plants the leaves are never perfect they

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.090 
plants the leaves are never perfect they
curl<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.550> they<00:03:02.880> twist<00:03:03.810> around<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> them

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
curl up they twist around some of them

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.270 
curl up they twist around some of them
are<00:03:05.160> half<00:03:05.370> dead<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.500> that's<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.769> whole<00:03:07.980> point

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
are half dead and that's the whole point

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.880 
are half dead and that's the whole point
now<00:03:08.910> here's<00:03:09.269> our<00:03:09.420> end<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:10.019> we<00:03:10.320> have<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> heat

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
now here's our end here we have to heat

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.580 
now here's our end here we have to heat
that<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.370> we're<00:03:11.519> going<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.180> close

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
that so we're going to get that in close

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.309 
that so we're going to get that in close
and<00:03:13.590> what's<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.610> happen<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.930> going

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
and what's going to happen is it's going

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.440 
and what's going to happen is it's going
to<00:03:18.620> close<00:03:19.620> up<00:03:20.100> by<00:03:20.580> quit<00:03:20.850> blowing<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
to close up by quit blowing on the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.190 
to close up by quit blowing on the
candle<00:03:21.930> my<00:03:22.530> breath<00:03:23.180> it's<00:03:24.180> going<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.569> close<00:03:24.840> up

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
candle my breath it's going to close up

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.740 
candle my breath it's going to close up
that<00:03:25.440> end<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.870> grab<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.350> bottom<00:03:28.860> of

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
that end and grab on to the bottom of

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.640 
that end and grab on to the bottom of
the<00:03:30.750> bottle<00:03:31.140> cap<00:03:32.180> making<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.239> nice<00:03:33.480> tight<00:03:34.200> seal

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.340 
the bottle cap making a nice tight seal
and<00:03:34.980> now<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.239> give<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> quick<00:03:36.780> spin<00:03:37.140> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
and now we just give it a quick spin to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.640 
and now we just give it a quick spin to
make<00:03:37.500> sure<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.920> there's<00:03:38.130> no<00:03:38.310> threads<00:03:38.670> loose

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
one that I did earlier today this was

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.630 
one that I did earlier today this was
the<00:04:11.700> prototype<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.260> as<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.829> can<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.400> on

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
the prototype and as you can see it's on

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.469 
the prototype and as you can see it's on
the<00:04:14.880> string<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.459> here's<00:04:17.459> our<00:04:17.640> new<00:04:17.820> flower<00:04:18.150> we

just made the two pieces so we're going

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.960 
just made the two pieces so we're going
to<00:04:22.650> skip<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> light<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.800> am<00:04:25.970> plugging

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
to skip a light so here I am plugging

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.620 
to skip a light so here I am plugging
this<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.450> know<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:30.180> slipped

through there and then what holds the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.750 
through there and then what holds the
flower<00:04:32.640> on<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.240> string<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:35.280> hole<00:04:35.550> we
