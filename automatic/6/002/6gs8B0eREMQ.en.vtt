00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.440
 My Little Pony~ 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.629
 Keke 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.260
 I have a feeling 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 Today’s show should be ..... 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 One of my most controversial shows 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.800
 Yes, today we are talking about 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.220
 My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.520
 AKA (also known as) 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.251
 MLP: FiM 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.260
 My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a TV cartoon program creation 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.960
 Created by Lauren Faust, she is the mainstay of popular shows. 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.220
 Such as the Flying Girl and the kiss 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.080
 But Faust originally planned to develop his own original program. 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.020
 Called "Milky Way &amp; The Galaxy Girls" 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.060
 This show even has its own website and promotional video. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.920
 However, Hasbro wants her to be a sequel to My Little Pony. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.860
 Friendship is Magic was born like this. 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 At this point you can't possibly hear about Bronies. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.680
 Otherwise it will not be required to make it into Top10Facts 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 In short, this show is obviously a cartoon made for little girls. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.559
 But don't know why 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 This program brings together a large number of fans of online youth and adult males. 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 Now known as Bronies 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.000
 Female fans are also known as Pegasisters 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 It all started at 4chan 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960
 Shortly after the first episode was premiered in 2010 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.060
 4chan members began to spawn images and videos of the show 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.991
 Quickly turned him into a stalk (memes) 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 Out of curiosity, more people went to see the first episode 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.140
 And quickly got fans outside the target group 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.740
 Since then, fans have no exaggeration on the Internet (XD) 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.620
 I even received the Pony version of OfficialThePony on Facebook. 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.260
 In the first episode of the show there are personal eyes presenting a rebellious eye (I will never say in the first episode 17:20) 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.200
 Later interpreted as an animated error 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.640
 Fans quickly noticed this and named the character 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.800
 Derpy or Derpy Hooves 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.620
 Because she looks a lot like the character Derpface 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.260
 And because fans like this role very much 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 The official kept her cocks and named her Derpy Hooves 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.800
 Princess Celestia was originally set as a queen 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 And has the highest authority, no one is higher than her 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.080
 However, she was converted into a princess, although Lauren Faust was opposed. 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 Because they think the children will think that the queen is a bad person, the princess is a good person. 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 Any TV show really renames people many times during the development process. 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.220
 For example, Twilight Sparkle was originally called Twilight. 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.720
 But Twilight has the legal issue of the Twilight franchise 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 Twilight Twinkle collided with his predecessor and finally decided to call Twilight Sparkle. 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.900
 Princess Luna was originally called Princess Selena. 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.760
 And the month of nightmare is called Discord (disorder) Σ(゚д゚) 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.440
 The last name gave another villain 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.720
 Incidentally, Luna is the moon in Italian and Spanish. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440
 Selene is the moon in Greek 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.460
 This is probably why they named it Nightmare Moon 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.800
 Gilda was originally called Grizelda. 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.260
 Applejack's dog Winoa was originally called Brandy or Buckaroo. 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.100
 And Ponyville (Pony Town) was originally called Fillydelphia. 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.860
 The role of Discord is entirely designed by Lauren Faust himself. 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.600
 In fact, this inspiration comes from the role of Star Trek, Q 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 In fact, the voice of Discord is the actor of Q. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.840
 This year's survey showed that the average age of Bronies is 21 years old. 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.620
 And more than 80% are male 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.700
 Female stereotypes given by this show 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.120
 Many people think that only gay men will go to see this show (thanks to Pritchard Jun) 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.280
 The same study shows that 85% of Bronies are heterosexual 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.980
 Another interesting point is that 80% of Bronies don't think they are beast control (what is the beast control itself (つд⊂)) 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.540
 75% of Bronies have not tried Cosplay 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.536
 45% of people have the habit of watching anime 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.980
 75% of Bronies have not maintained stable contacts in the past 12 months (°v°) 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.220
 72% still live with their parents 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.280
 Most people are coming into contact with this show from the second season of the animation. 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.220
 Most people first saw it by message or picture wall. 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.400
 This program has a lot of references and tributes 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.520
 For example, Dr. Hooves is a reference to Doctor Who 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.700
 Canterlot is inspired by Minas Tirith in the Lord of the Rings 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.320
 At the end of The Return of Harmony (S02E02) 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.180
 This episode almost reproduces the Star Wars Quartet: Twilight's action (20:40 of S02E02) 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.900
 The three male characters in The Cutie Pox (S02E06) are from 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.540
 Movie murder green toe (The Big Lebowski 1998) 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.680
 It can be seen that both occur in the bowling alley. 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.440
 TV show I Love Lucy's well-known bridge 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.060
 Replayed in The Last Roundup (S02E14) (10:45 of S2E14) 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.340
 Read It and Weep (S02E16) clearly quoted 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.200
 Indiana Jones series, and a lot of reference bridges 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.740
 Sometimes you will see colored ribbons tied to the tail of the horse. 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.260
 This color usually has its meaning 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.700
 For example, blue, which means it is a stallion 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.960
 Red means this is a horse that loves to kick people. 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.660
 Applejack's ribbon color.... 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.100
 Well, you can imagine it yourself. 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.880
 No matter what you think about this show and its fans 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.400
 It is undeniable that a huge number of Bronies have become a reality. 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.720
 There is a large party called BronyCon every year. 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.680
 More than 8,000 people entered last year 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.700
 Three documentaries about Brony once again turned this phenomenon on the table. 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.600
 More effective than making a short film 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.220
 The latest documentary is A Brony Tale in 2014. 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.440
 (thanks for watching) 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.262
 (This really took me a lot of brain cells) 

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:33.260
 (I can't turn it over before I said that there is no subtitles.) 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
 (But then I found that Youtube's automatic subtitles actually) (can translate about 80% of standard English) 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.940
 (I got the Top10Facts: MLP out of my mind)
