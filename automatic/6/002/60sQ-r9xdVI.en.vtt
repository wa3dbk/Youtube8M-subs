00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.010
 single women and that goes up 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779

 [Music]

 but so on the same number that will bring 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 the impact of the seats you think that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.450

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.250
 that is simple this is going to apply 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.150
 [Music] 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.800
 I put my pending success to soak the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.970
 cinema chair soak the 190 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.950
 he wants to enjoy the movie more 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.019
 easily 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.019
 [Music] 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.810
 you think I can be your christian 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.750
 free 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.270
 because the little one for me but how ugly 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.160
 all all the people are living 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.920
 he has no right to 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.920
 and I was trying 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.350
 hi how about 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.930
 they came to see 50 shades of serious no 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.030
 we arrived and prefer to kill the same 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.880
 railing since it will not have for the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.680
 film timbers 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.510
 as its name dispatch are like the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.340
 vibrant of the rumba make it kiss on the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.160
 Sambil on the next railing without 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.160
 shadow and tongue in the ass 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.900
 but we did not arrive when 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.870
 you bought for the first function or 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.519
 the second to the second 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 and I'm not friend that the chairs are 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.290
 wet as the first one, not because the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.569
 People who have not read the book do not know 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.920
 really that means the movie to 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.349
 everyone thinks it is that one is going 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.390
 to go masturbate in there and it's no more 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.060
 that can not leave you take it out 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.060
 I went in once at a time and they did not let me 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.730
 this relationship will improve after 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.730
 today certainly does not wait 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.500
 and he did not even bring me to use 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.930
 ricardo montaner several times 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.150
 not long graphic that like they give class 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.150
 and a little of that is loneliness 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.960
 what steps are you taking here at the cinema 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.620
 to clean the chair after 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.700
 see the 50 shadows of bass 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.770
 good 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.540
 no manolo because we have to 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.790
 enter the area as quickly as possible 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.590
 can so that people the next 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.629
 function if that is wet it stayed like that 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 there's going to be only because my niece 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.330

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:58.050

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.050

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.720

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.120
 what would you like to do to him some woman of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.870
 what makes you Christian and fuck is 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.640
 something that I would like to do is going to touch you 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.830
 the tiger jump who has to 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.200
 you have to go you have to 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.150
 surrender to the tiger jump have made 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.150
 something that books know 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.010
 in sight to the city and they have done 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.010

 no no no no no 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.450
 the sky in love can see a 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.030
 sexual movie with my mom and when they see 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.410
 with semen sex scenes and all that my 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.510
 Mom next door and quiet 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.510
 I do not know what I'm going to do 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.510
 [Music] 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.510
 creative 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.900
 how weird is coming to mess with my brother 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.759
 the bride in the 50 shadows grace get 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.080
 that there are no entries for 31 months brothers 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.379
 with the penguins more charge with the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.379
 sniper 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.220
 I have no passion for hawks 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.509
 I miss that beautiful expert 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.099
 I would like the passion of 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:39.490
 Gavilanes do what Christian does 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:41.349
 and hug hug hawks passion 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.690
 I think that would be the last breath 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:47.430
 you already know that the history of cristian 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.430
 grace is based on the life of mandela 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.350
 when he is in South Africa in jail 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.860
 of the current the crazy breaststroke smoking 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.330
 and that's where the story comes from 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.250
 Now you know when they are asked 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.539
 Do you want to be a millionaire? 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.539
 in which villa was sacristan grace 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.810
 very well you already had to win the 250 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.330
 millions that technique will use to 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.310
 put his hand in the Chinese I put a 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.229
 dress to the classic the dress by 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.250

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.830

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.370

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.370
