rockets and jets in their playground but
the<00:00:38.489> children<00:00:38.910> wanted<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.719> further<00:00:39.989> still

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.139 

they<00:00:43.559> were<00:00:43.620> fascinated<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.340> how<00:00:44.609> fast<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
they were fascinated by how fast the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
they were fascinated by how fast the
Rockets<00:00:45.750> wait<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.710> thought<00:00:46.829> it'd<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
Rockets wait but just thought it'd be

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
Rockets wait but just thought it'd be
fantastic<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.449> they<00:00:48.570> could<00:00:48.750> build<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.019> carts

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
fantastic if they could build the carts

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
fantastic if they could build the carts
themselves<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.920> drive<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.449> start<00:00:51.690> off

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
themselves to drive so and we start off

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
themselves to drive so and we start off
with<00:00:51.929> some<00:00:52.170> -<00:00:52.350> -<00:00:52.379> wood<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.699> some

with some - - wood and through some

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.490 
with some - - wood and through some
simple<00:00:54.120> designs<00:00:54.539> using<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.019> triangulation

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
simple designs using the triangulation

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.799 
simple designs using the triangulation
firm<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> power<00:00:56.519> buckets<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.539> they

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
firm they will to power buckets and they

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.959 
firm they will to power buckets and they
form<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> chasis<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.850> would

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
form the chasis there now that would

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
form the chasis there now that would
emit<00:01:00.179> we<00:01:00.269> called<00:01:00.510> Cora<00:01:00.780> flute<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.710> give<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.990 

that's<00:01:07.380> sassy<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> looks<00:01:08.790> like

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that's sassy that's what it looks like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.160 
that's sassy that's what it looks like
if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.409> took<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:11.479> steering<00:01:12.479> wheel<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.079> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if you took off my steering wheel it's a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
if you took off my steering wheel it's a
pair<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> white<00:01:13.710> candle<00:01:14.159> yeah<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.329> got<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pair of white candle yeah it's got a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.069 
pair of white candle yeah it's got a
very<00:01:15.869> unique<00:01:16.110> hood<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.930> in

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
very unique hood back then so you get in

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.880 
very unique hood back then so you get in
and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.650> isn't<00:01:19.920> secure<00:01:21.590> firming<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and then there isn't secure firming so

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
and then there isn't secure firming so
if<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.220> crash<00:01:25.159> we've<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.390> pink<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.570> pass<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
if we crash we've got pink go pass this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.069 
if we crash we've got pink go pass this
right<00:01:28.350> triangle<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.750> lever

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
right triangle and here we have a lever

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
right triangle and here we have a lever
so<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.009> pull<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.220> back<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:32.939> scrape

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so when we pull it back it will scrape

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
so when we pull it back it will scrape
against<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.350> wheels<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.890> both<00:01:35.070> sides<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.670> make

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
against the wheels on both sides to make

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
against the wheels on both sides to make
the<00:01:36.000> wheel<00:01:36.149> stop<00:01:36.479> flowing<00:01:36.719> if<00:01:37.439> anything<00:01:38.130> were

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the wheel stop flowing if anything were

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
the wheel stop flowing if anything were
to<00:01:38.340> happen<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.969> car<00:01:39.149> workshop<00:01:39.390> louver

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
to happen if the car workshop louver

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
to happen if the car workshop louver
let's<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.009> say<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.640> wouldn't<00:01:41.969> fall<00:01:42.600> out

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
let's just say that we wouldn't fall out

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
let's just say that we wouldn't fall out
and<00:01:45.619> spray<00:01:46.619> painted<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:48.079> by<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.860> cycles

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and spray painted it with by the cycles

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.179 
and spray painted it with by the cycles
and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.360> ropes<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.840> tied<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.469> axle<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and the ropes are tied on the axle and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.480 
and the ropes are tied on the axle and
maybe<00:01:53.579> pull<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> ropes

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490 

and<00:01:57.490> we've<00:01:57.670> added<00:01:58.120> this<00:01:58.450> piece<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:58.870> tape<00:01:59.080> just

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and we've added this piece of tape just

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.010 
and we've added this piece of tape just
in<00:01:59.710> case<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.670> Sun<00:02:00.940> gets<00:02:01.210> in<00:02:01.479> either

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
in case like the Sun gets in either

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.090 
in case like the Sun gets in either
mm-hmm

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
mm-hmm

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.859 
mm-hmm
but<00:02:03.400> we've<00:02:03.580> got<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.940> like<00:02:04.119> result<00:02:04.570> because

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
but we've got to like result because

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.180 
but we've got to like result because
lightnings<00:02:05.290> both<00:02:05.920> fast<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.880> our<00:02:07.000> cars<00:02:07.270> box<00:02:08.190> the

lightnings both fast in our cars box the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.770 
lightnings both fast in our cars box the
children<00:02:09.490> really<00:02:09.819> enjoy<00:02:10.090> building<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.450> karts

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
children really enjoy building the karts

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.480 
children really enjoy building the karts
