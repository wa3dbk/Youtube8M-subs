00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.560
 hi all my name is Vasily behind the scenes 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.990
 not as always helps the eugraf today we 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.240
 we will prepare b-52 full numerical 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.309
 requests like any famous cocktail 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.720
 naturally nobody knows who and when 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.320
 came up with b-52 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.419
 but he has this less clear 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.740
 version which tends to 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.249
 52 came up in the seventy-seventh year in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.900
 Canada 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.600
 this cocktail is named after 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.970
 biffy's american bomber 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.850
 titus and so the Americans are even lower 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.580
 sometimes called his bee classic 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.380
 cocktail recipe 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.140
 implies three ingredients baileys 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.940
 coffee liqueur and now i'm 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.600
 surprisingly sure it never 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.170
 triple sec 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 And it never even Cointreau and this 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.610
 orange liquor board leg nicky 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.910
 only grande marie 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.450
 variations of type b 53b 56 there and so on in 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.999
 57 if i'm not mistaken instead of grant 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.640
 mariette added Cointreau 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:09.950
 or triple sec and this is the classic 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.499
 b-52 which most of us drink 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.600
 today we give a little bit of tradition 

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.789
 share one cocktail for the entire film crew 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.090
 the group 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.579
 let's do two at once and honestly split them and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 in the count and share stick in groups 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.119
 she does not share with the film crew 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.030
 we can say about layers 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 following a banal thing in all three 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.219
 drinks different sugar content and 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.139
 correspondingly different density if anyone 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.810
 taught physics and chemistry they understand that 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.340
 different densities suspect different weights 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.229
 accordingly if you pour them 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 neatly then all this will not be 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.319
 mix will go to bed neatly 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 layers that we try today 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.499
 make well we will naturally 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.100
 use class 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:53.460
 but basically 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.780
 if you are belly or if you have not found Halla 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.979
 you can use any 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.070
 another drink 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.810
 all three ingredients come in different 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.220
 parts 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.350
 next we take crawled out again if you 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 miser if you do not have fox you can 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.840
 add some other liquor 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.000
 e.g. Bragansa class just below and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
 if you are at all capital brawl you 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 you can just mix condensed milk with vodka 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.989
 and in principle, as well, too 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.730
 anywhere a few words about how to pour 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.230
 so that nothing I mixed 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.330
 I prefer to use this 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.830
 bar spoon at the end of which you have 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 such a rounding which is called 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.569
 heel can be turned and poured 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.310
 neatly on the spoon itself well I 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.860
 again a recipe for miser you can 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.750
 just use a knife and a knife blade 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 neatly important do not convince yourself 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.530
 pour the second layer today we will 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.420
 cook naturally with Cointreau 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.340
 as most do that way 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 neatly pour Cointreau 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.950
 most difficult because its density 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.630
 most closely in the forest and they are so so 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 fall on each other but when 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.459
 a certain skill if you don't drink a lot 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.730
 the day before it can happen 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.260
 about igniting Russian people always 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.130
 set fire to b-52 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.130
 but generally it is believed that the b-52 is burning it 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.910
 slightly different drink and the flame in my 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.390
 fifty tu 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.970
 and he even has his echoes in history 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.640
 because that same bomber 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.920
 thanks to which the cocktail b-52 received 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.430
 his name he 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 dumped the so-called bomb lighters 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.670
 so this cocktail and began to set fire 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.709
 and so he got her 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.140
 distribution for those who want 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.510
 Cocktail 5 I set fire to them 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.120
 highly recommend not first 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.770
 lower the straw 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.680
 thoughtfully look at her and then 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.140
 start drinking and first take a straw in 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.000
 mouth and lowering it immediately start drinking 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.920
 because otherwise the straw 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.769
 just finish add one more 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.980
 where up to at best you won't drink 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.230
 cocktail worst case you drink 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.600
 a little burnt plastics and it smells 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.610
 so so what a eugraph in spite of 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.220
 shooting bans I suggest 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.920
 Naturally set fire with a toothpick is not easier 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.140
 I think that this is not easier because you 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.180
 should keep her on the edge and in this 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.040
 cocktail case must be 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 poured to the top and in this case it 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.720
 impossible to convey to a drunken friend on 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.729
 dance floor I have nowhere and somehow do not carry 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.250
 so I poured almost 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.650
 completely well and do not cost too long 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.150
 carry a cocktail for the widows of an explicit friend on 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.760
 dance floor because a glass can 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.390
 heat up too much and just 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.500
 burst do like me 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.500
 [music] 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.419
 lukewarm heat spreads over 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.800
 the archway is a beautiful cocktail but in large 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.680
 quantities naturally not day not 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.880
 recommended and naturally not needed 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.260
 never drink it like this when he 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.669
 is burning 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.740
 It would seem that this stupid statement 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.020
 type thanks cap but I watched it 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.550
 repeatedly and therefore I say no 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.550
 so do it is fraught with consequences 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.990
 subscribe to our groups in 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.840
 VKontakte in facebook 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.490
 look for us on YouTube and remember the most 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.320
 the best cocktails humor at the bar 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.820
 you can find in the association group 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.820
 bartenders drink amounts of gentlemen 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.669
 [music] 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.099
 Yes, you look more 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.409
 see more drink less important 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.509
 otherwise you will drink more 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.579
 then you will look less then me 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.929
 it seems it is interconnected dressed rangers 

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:50.319
 there will also be a comment will be just 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:52.089
 more such too come across now 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.959
 it became clear to me where the incoherent 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:58.349
 comments people are experimenting at home 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.349
 Well done boys
