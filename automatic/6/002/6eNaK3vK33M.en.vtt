00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.740 

so<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.290> new<00:00:19.470> snapshot<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.340> out<00:00:20.610> today<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.390> code

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
so the new snapshot is out today is code

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.519 
so the new snapshot is out today is code
name<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.050> 12<00:00:22.770> wo<00:00:23.460> 8<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.270> so<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.170> bunch<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
name is 12 wo 8 a so there's a bunch of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
name is 12 wo 8 a so there's a bunch of
bug<00:00:25.770> fixes<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.369> lighting<00:00:27.060> fixes<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> stuff

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
bug fixes and lighting fixes and stuff

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.800 
bug fixes and lighting fixes and stuff
you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.770> also<00:00:29.040> place<00:00:29.670> stair<00:00:30.390> blocks

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you can now also place stair blocks

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
you can now also place stair blocks
upside<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.860> on<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.460> ceiling<00:00:32.910> for

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
upside down on the ceiling for

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.540 
upside down on the ceiling for
decoration<00:00:33.960> Jeb<00:00:34.470> says<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> might<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.220> able<00:00:35.310> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
decoration Jeb says you might be able to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
decoration Jeb says you might be able to
put<00:00:35.760> half<00:00:36.090> blocks<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> ceiling<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.470> well

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
put half blocks on the ceiling as well

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.430 
put half blocks on the ceiling as well
in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.310> future<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> bit<00:00:39.720> trickier<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
in the future but it's a bit trickier to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.830 
in the future but it's a bit trickier to
code<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.220> just<00:00:41.520> yet<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.390> course<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
code so not just yet but of course the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
code so not just yet but of course the
big<00:00:43.050> news<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.770> new<00:00:43.920> snapshot<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.790> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
big news in the new snapshot is the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.900 
big news in the new snapshot is the
villagers<00:00:45.720> defense<00:00:46.310> against<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.670> zombies

which is the new mob the iron golem I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
which is the new mob the iron golem I
got<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> couple<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.220> videos<00:00:53.550> earlier<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.330> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
got a couple of videos earlier of a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.690 
got a couple of videos earlier of a
naturally<00:00:55.080> spawned<00:00:55.470> one<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.520> basically

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
naturally spawned one they basically

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.240 
naturally spawned one they basically
knock<00:00:57.330> zombies<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.230> other<00:00:58.440> mobs<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:59.010> well

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
knock zombies and other mobs as well

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.640 
knock zombies and other mobs as well
right<00:00:59.700> up<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.420> air<00:01:00.450> they<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.260> attack

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
right up into the air they don't attack

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.950 
right up into the air they don't attack
creepers<00:01:02.370> much<00:01:02.700> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> same<00:01:03.150> way<00:01:03.210> wolves

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
creepers much in the same way wolves

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
creepers much in the same way wolves
don't<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.500> presume<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.640> stop<00:01:05.880> creepers

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
don't I presume this is to stop creepers

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
don't I presume this is to stop creepers
exploding<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> destroying<00:01:07.830> stuff<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> don't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
exploding and destroying stuff you don't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
exploding and destroying stuff you don't
want<00:01:08.820> destroyed<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:09.990> don't<00:01:10.320> attack

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
want destroyed they also don't attack

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.960 
want destroyed they also don't attack
slimes<00:01:11.340> magma<00:01:12.240> cubes<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.950> ghasts<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
slimes magma cubes and ghasts but all of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
slimes magma cubes and ghasts but all of
the<00:01:15.090> other<00:01:15.210> hostile<00:01:15.780> mobs<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.770> attack<00:01:17.310> if

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the other hostile mobs it will attack if

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.790 
the other hostile mobs it will attack if
they<00:01:18.030> die<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.810> there's<00:01:19.049> lots<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.380> villagers

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
they die but there's lots of villagers

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.490 
they die but there's lots of villagers
still<00:01:20.130> around<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:20.940> will<00:01:21.240> respawn<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.260> guess

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
still around they will respawn I guess

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
still around they will respawn I guess
the<00:01:22.740> idea<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.790> villagers<00:01:24.270> rebuild

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the idea is that the villagers rebuild

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
the idea is that the villagers rebuild
them<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> talking<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.159> building<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
them and talking of building them you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.570 
them and talking of building them you
can<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.630> build<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.440> yourself<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
can actually build them yourself out of

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.390 
can actually build them yourself out of
iron<00:01:30.030> blocks<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.840> pumpkin<00:01:31.409> head<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.860> bit

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
iron blocks and a pumpkin head a bit

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.540 
iron blocks and a pumpkin head a bit
like<00:01:32.700> building<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.450> snow<00:01:33.750> golem<00:01:34.050> also<00:01:34.890> John<00:01:35.220> has

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
like building a snow golem also John has

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.060 
like building a snow golem also John has
confirmed<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:37.290> much<00:01:37.380> inspired

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
confirmed that it is very much inspired

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
confirmed that it is very much inspired

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
iron golem will also pick flowers and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.530 
iron golem will also pick flowers and
hand<00:01:46.740> them<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> villagers<00:01:47.940> which<00:01:48.210> i<00:01:48.479> think

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
hand them out to villagers which i think

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
hand them out to villagers which i think

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is really cute so the first video today

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.200 
is really cute so the first video today
is<00:01:53.580> by<00:01:53.790> h<00:01:54.150> 22<00:01:54.810> 11<00:01:55.409> games<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.670> found<00:01:56.970> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
is by h 22 11 games and they found a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
is by h 22 11 games and they found a
really<00:01:57.390> cool<00:01:57.690> way<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> doing<00:01:58.590> instant

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
really cool way of doing instant

really cool way of doing instant
vertical<00:02:00.210> red<00:02:00.479> stone<00:02:00.900> which<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.590> possible<00:02:02.070> now

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
vertical red stone which is possible now

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.789 
vertical red stone which is possible now
you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.610> place<00:02:02.880> redstone<00:02:03.299> dust<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.260> top<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you can place redstone dust on top of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.310 
you can place redstone dust on top of
glow<00:02:05.310> stone<00:02:05.640> blocks<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:06.960> check<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
glow stone blocks so go and check that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
glow stone blocks so go and check that
out<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> full<00:02:08.250> information<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.090> pattern

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
out for the full information and pattern

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.589 
out for the full information and pattern
and<00:02:09.780> why<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.259> works<00:02:10.739> then<00:02:11.400> chasing<00:02:12.000> effects

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
and why it works then chasing effects
