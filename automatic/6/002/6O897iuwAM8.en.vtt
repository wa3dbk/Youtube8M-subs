00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
little bracket give us a stock move in
there<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> second<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.970> got<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> six

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
there for a second it's got a six

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.380 
there for a second it's got a six
millimeter<00:01:48.930> nut<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.520> mounts<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
millimeter nut that mounts it to the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.469 
millimeter nut that mounts it to the
block<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> engine<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it'll<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
block of the engine so it'll be kind of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.780 
block of the engine so it'll be kind of
sitting<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:56.579> kind

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
sitting there like that and it will kind

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.480 
sitting there like that and it will kind
of<00:01:56.880> connect<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> two<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> little

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
of connect the two and there's a little

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
of connect the two and there's a little
six<00:01:59.490> millimeter<00:02:00.170> instead<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> hex<00:02:01.619> head

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
six millimeter instead like a hex head

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.359 
six millimeter instead like a hex head
and<00:02:03.229> you've<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> remove<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.159> take

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and you've got to remove that to take

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
and you've got to remove that to take
this<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.180> course<00:02:06.439> I've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.680> two

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.860 
but anyway that's what the starter looks
like<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.370> too<00:03:06.550> heavy<00:03:06.870> pretty

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870

manageable<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> AC<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:12.070> out<00:03:12.220> this

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
manageable and when the AC is out this

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.640 
manageable and when the AC is out this
is<00:03:12.580> what<00:03:12.700> you're<00:03:12.820> going<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.090> looking<00:03:13.330> at

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
the end of that all right so it's got a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.439 
the end of that all right so it's got a
16<00:05:00.280> millimeter<00:05:01.229> bolt<00:05:02.460> give<00:05:03.460> me<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.820> second

sitting in the starter housing well the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.439 
sitting in the starter housing well the
problem<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.710> is<00:05:09.039> you<00:05:09.250> can't<00:05:09.520> there's<00:05:10.270> almost

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.550 
no room to work so how I ended up doing
this<00:05:12.789> was<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.150> took<00:05:13.210> up<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.750> flathead

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
this was I took up a flathead

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.040 
this was I took up a flathead
screwdriver<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:15.250> long<00:05:15.550> one<00:05:15.880> and<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.690> had<00:05:16.870> my

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
screwdriver a long one and I had my

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.830 
screwdriver a long one and I had my
socket<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.680> course<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.610> driver<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.360> I

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
socket of course and the driver and I

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.260 
socket of course and the driver and I
just<00:05:20.050> put<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.440> screwdriver<00:05:21.220> underneath<00:05:21.940> the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
just put the screwdriver underneath the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.810 
just put the screwdriver underneath the
end<00:05:22.479> of<00:05:22.930> this<00:05:23.380> underneath<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.099> socket<00:05:24.669> so

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
end of this underneath the socket so

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.089 
end of this underneath the socket so
when<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.720> started<00:05:26.050> once<00:05:26.320> you<00:05:26.620> see<00:05:26.740> how<00:05:26.860> long

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
when you started once you see how long

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.879 
when you started once you see how long
it<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:28.690> basically<00:05:28.900> have<00:05:29.260> no<00:05:29.530> tension

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
it is so you basically have no tension

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.469 
it is so you basically have no tension
on<00:05:30.010> it<00:05:30.039> for<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.370> last<00:05:30.550> inch<00:05:30.849> and<00:05:30.970> a<00:05:31.030> half<00:05:31.060> so

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
on it for the last inch and a half so

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.750 
on it for the last inch and a half so
this<00:05:31.599> is<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.260> pain<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.740> butt<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:33.729> I

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
this is really a pain in the butt so I

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.279 
this is really a pain in the butt so I
just<00:05:34.090> put<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.300> little<00:05:34.479> bit<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.720> tension<00:05:34.900> on<00:05:35.169> the

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
just put a little bit of tension on the

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.899 
just put a little bit of tension on the
socket<00:05:35.710> in<00:05:35.830> right<00:05:36.039> here<00:05:36.220> with<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.400> heads<00:05:36.639> at

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
socket in right here with the heads at

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.629 
socket in right here with the heads at
and<00:05:37.090> took<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:37.960> out<00:05:38.099> that's<00:05:39.099> how<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.310> get<00:05:39.520> the

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
back one out it's kind of a pain anyway

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.060 
back one out it's kind of a pain anyway
it's<00:05:42.250> probably<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.760> worst<00:05:42.940> one<00:05:43.889> all<00:05:44.889> right

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
it's probably the worst one all right

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.909 
it's probably the worst one all right
now<00:05:45.190> let<00:05:45.310> me<00:05:45.340> go<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.580> here<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:45.820> dress<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.919> a/c

they're<00:06:21.520> 13<00:06:21.970> millimeter<00:06:22.479> they<00:06:22.690> just<00:06:22.900> slide

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
they're 13 millimeter they just slide

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.730 
they're 13 millimeter they just slide
off<00:06:23.409> as<00:06:23.820> far<00:06:24.820> as<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.060> tensioner<00:06:25.539> here<00:06:25.900> you're

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
off as far as the tensioner here you're

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.250 
off as far as the tensioner here you're
going<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:26.889> need<00:06:27.070> a<00:06:27.099> six<00:06:27.430> millimeter<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:29.110> can

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
going to need a six millimeter you can

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.910 
going to need a six millimeter you can
see<00:06:29.500> that

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
see that

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.980 
see that
idea<00:06:30.160> that's<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.610> six-millimeter<00:06:31.090> hacks<00:06:31.660> on

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
idea that's a six-millimeter hacks on

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.620 
idea that's a six-millimeter hacks on
both<00:06:32.290> ends<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.040> as<00:06:33.760> soon<00:06:33.940> as<00:06:34.060> you<00:06:34.180> loosen<00:06:34.510> up

both ends and as soon as you loosen up
both<00:06:34.870> of<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.110> hexes<00:06:35.620> you<00:06:36.340> can<00:06:36.520> just<00:06:36.670> move<00:06:36.850> it

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
both of the hexes you can just move it

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.370 
both of the hexes you can just move it
by<00:06:37.150> hand<00:06:37.510> no<00:06:37.810> problem<00:06:37.840> on<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.590> tensioning<00:06:39.100> and

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
by hand no problem on the tensioning and

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.380 
by hand no problem on the tensioning and
once<00:06:41.380> again<00:06:41.730> that's<00:06:42.730> how<00:06:42.940> it<00:06:43.030> looks<00:06:43.240> under

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
once again that's how it looks under

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.980 
once again that's how it looks under
there<00:06:43.870> and<00:06:44.280> man<00:06:45.280> what<00:06:45.610> a<00:06:45.640> tight<00:06:46.120> fit<00:06:46.480> guys<00:06:46.720> this

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
there and man what a tight fit guys this

is<00:06:47.140> tight<00:06:47.380> tight<00:06:47.650> tight<00:06:47.710> tight<00:06:48.250> tight<00:06:48.280> but<00:06:48.910> you

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
is tight tight tight tight tight but you

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.920 
is tight tight tight tight tight but you
got<00:06:49.240> to<00:06:49.390> be<00:06:49.480> patient<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.230> will<00:06:50.440> come<00:06:50.680> out

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
got to be patient and it will come out

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.090 
got to be patient and it will come out
so<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:53.050> only<00:06:53.200> real<00:06:53.440> tools<00:06:53.740> you're<00:06:53.920> going<00:06:53.950> to

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
so the only real tools you're going to

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.010 
so the only real tools you're going to
need<00:06:54.190> is<00:06:54.730> like<00:06:55.090> a<00:06:55.210> sign<00:06:55.480> a<00:06:55.510> little<00:06:55.810> six

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
need is like a sign a little six

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.860 
need is like a sign a little six
millimeter<00:06:56.880> metric<00:06:57.880> set<00:06:58.330> of<00:06:58.450> hexes<00:06:58.780> here<00:06:59.140> um

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
millimeter metric set of hexes here um

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.480 
millimeter metric set of hexes here um
other<00:07:01.870> than<00:07:02.110> that<00:07:02.290> it<00:07:02.650> was<00:07:02.770> just<00:07:02.950> a<00:07:03.040> 16

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
other than that it was just a 16

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.730 
other than that it was just a 16
millimeter<00:07:03.780> of<00:07:04.780> course<00:07:05.020> for<00:07:05.260> the<00:07:05.350> starter

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
millimeter of course for the starter

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.860 
millimeter of course for the starter
bolts<00:07:06.160> 13<00:07:06.640> millimeter<00:07:07.120> you'll<00:07:07.390> need<00:07:07.540> as<00:07:07.660> well

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
bolts 13 millimeter you'll need as well

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.430 
bolts 13 millimeter you'll need as well
and<00:07:08.740> I<00:07:09.610> believe<00:07:09.640> the<00:07:10.150> wheel<00:07:10.360> was<00:07:10.630> like<00:07:10.810> a<00:07:10.840> 17

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
and I believe the wheel was like a 17

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.080 
and I believe the wheel was like a 17
millimeter<00:07:11.650> it's<00:07:12.190> kind<00:07:12.340> of<00:07:12.370> an<00:07:12.490> odd<00:07:12.640> number

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
millimeter it's kind of an odd number

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.550 
millimeter it's kind of an odd number
but<00:07:13.240> it's<00:07:13.390> a<00:07:13.480> Volkswagen<00:07:13.660> so<00:07:14.170> everything's

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
but it's a Volkswagen so everything's

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.790 
but it's a Volkswagen so everything's
odd<00:07:14.830> about<00:07:15.130> it<00:07:15.310> um<00:07:16.080> before<00:07:17.080> you<00:07:17.350> start<00:07:17.650> the<00:07:17.770> job

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
odd about it um before you start the job

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.290 
odd about it um before you start the job
you<00:07:18.160> definitely<00:07:18.550> want<00:07:18.700> to<00:07:18.730> take<00:07:18.880> off<00:07:19.120> the

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
you definitely want to take off the

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.940 
you definitely want to take off the
battery<00:07:19.510> just<00:07:19.960> to<00:07:20.050> make<00:07:20.230> sure<00:07:20.380> you<00:07:20.590> don't<00:07:20.800> have

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
battery just to make sure you don't have

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.540 
battery just to make sure you don't have
sparks<00:07:21.370> flying<00:07:21.670> anywhere<00:07:22.950> but<00:07:23.950> long<00:07:24.220> story

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
sparks flying anywhere but long story

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.120 
sparks flying anywhere but long story
short<00:07:24.880> you<00:07:25.260> can<00:07:26.260> do<00:07:26.350> this<00:07:26.500> job<00:07:26.680> in<00:07:26.860> about<00:07:27.040> an

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
short you can do this job in about an

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.040 
short you can do this job in about an
hour<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.430> a<00:07:27.520> half<00:07:27.700> it's<00:07:28.060> kind<00:07:28.330> of<00:07:28.360> a<00:07:28.480> pain<00:07:28.720> you
