00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
here he's waiting and he'll come to the
jump<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.960> he<00:01:16.020> jumps<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> top<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> me<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
jump so he jumps right on top of me and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
jump so he jumps right on top of me and
there's<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.450> try<00:01:19.229> and
