00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 good morning to all the boys then 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.010
 we are here at the presentation event of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.080
 lg presenting its new g3 a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.630
 device that resumes at the end 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 what are the innovations brought 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.260
 from the g2, however, by improving all the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 compartments where it was possible to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 improving his predecessor is always 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.330
 obviously present the first game 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 what we notice is a screen really 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.579
 incredible I try to get closer to do 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 see the pixel density they are 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.390
 practically invisible is impossible 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
 see the pixels as we have one 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.960
 hd screen then four times the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.280
 hd resolution with precise resolution 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 of 2500 60 per thousand and 440 test ad 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.309
 enter the gallery to show you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 Meanwhile, some photos taken this 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.710
 photo we took on the fly and the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.979
 definition is really good here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 precisely also from our colleagues 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.549
 enter the camera to let you see 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
 the very simplified new interface 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 as you can see we have practically no 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 no type of call center 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.470
 if not precisely these in the upper left 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.540
 of the settings it calls up 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.850
 standard interface of the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.729
 camera and we had only the key before 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.770
 back the shot is really lightning-fast 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.740
 quick to focus because he was a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 a little hard I try to get up at 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.780
 take a shot 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.240
 on the fly 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.310
 and here too it is very very fast 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.070
 settings are really many 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.200
 activable cell hdr e 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 can be deactivated the grid is there 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.490
 really so many settings 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.240
 as the automatic mode the magic 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.420
 focus 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 the panorama is the possibility of a note 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.899
 make yourself deserted with the new camera 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.970
 ddl g as you have seen we are also one 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.299
 quite uncomfortable position I do 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.159
 see also that we have this behind 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.000
 new sensor here than a laser sensor 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.459
 which allows automatic fire 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.019
 in a very fast way because 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.690
 it is practically no longer a focus 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.250
 to digital but a focus through 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.880
 laser that recognizes the distance and therefore 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.489
 we have an autofocus practically in 0.3 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.120
 seconds practically in a beaters of 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.250
 faber 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.900
 in fact always present we go into the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.480
 settings while I show you 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.849
 like all the sections of the device 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.670
 are as colorful as ad 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.319
 identify the various possibilities of the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.690
 device settings for example 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.040
 are gray we go in general we go 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.680
 on the info on the phone and I do 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.500
 see how in the information on the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.470
 software we have the android version 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.549
 4.4.2 as you have also noticed 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.409
 lg interface from was 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.900
 completely renewed now is a lot 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.730
 more pleasant and icons have been a lot 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.739
 more simplified in a very style 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.530
 even the notification drop-down menu is minimal 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.980
 she is much prettier with this background 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.290
 black and these very minimal icons i 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.549
 obviously present all and to all 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.159
 sensors also present on the c2 like 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.190
 blaster lesmo the app that I am 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.349
 callable precisely through which slide 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.720
 as we can see then a 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.629
 device completely renewed vi 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.430
 I also show in the messages here 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.139
 in fact we see the section o 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.850
 identified by the new color yellow 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.510
 keyboard that in the settings 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.710
 we can modify and modify 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.330
 the height of the keyboard 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.530
 up to this level really 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.319
 easy 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.330
 I try to predict without any kind of 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.080
 vibration problem is also a lot 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.810
 good 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.730
 the device equipped by the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:54.520
 snapdragon 801 processor and there will be 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380
 two versions a 16 gig with 2gb of ram 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.020
 while another with 32gb of memory 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.450
 internal and 3gb of ram prices are not 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.270
 still communicated 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.209
 we only have the information on the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.110
 availability that will be for the end of 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.050
 June the third week of June in Ci 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.160
 they communicate is another thing that comes to me 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.049
 I forgot to tell you is that the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.209
 camera still remains a 13 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.169
 megapixel with the new stabilization 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.540
 lg optics that remains is above all 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:30.430
 a very important thing 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.890
 lg has listened to its consumers throughout 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.840
 customers and now with great difficulty vi 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.020
 I open this which is a plastic cover 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.580
 but really an excellent finish is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.650
 really closed practically seems 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.140
 metal is the real feeling it can 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.410
 be metal the battery always remains 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.640
 a 3000 milian for this time though 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.990
 removable we also have the entrance 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.020
 micro sd in addition to the one for the micro sim 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.229
 therefore this excellent brushing of the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.320
 back cover in addition to that 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.370
 that I have you 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.440
 as soon as we said we have in the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.490
 really interesting device that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.670
 an excellent successor to the already exceptional 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.310
 g2 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.870
 we can't wait to try it for you 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.510
 to discover all the possibilities e 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.510
 all the features for this brief 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:22.550
 preview of lg g3 is all a greeting a 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.490
 all from short extra tones here we catch 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.190
 an opportunity to show the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.250
 difference between the new g3 is the old one 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.720
 even if it calls the old exaggerated g2 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.220
 also on a dimensional level such as 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:41.390
 we can see is a little bit higher 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.220
 tg3 seems a little thinner and 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.360
 also in terms of width and 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.460
 the tg3 is slightly larger 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.510
 but let's remember that the difference 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.310
 it is given above all what 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.000
 difference in screens as in c2 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.680
 mounts a 5.2 inch full hd while 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.990
 in the gt3 and mounts 15 inches and a half 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.780
 quad hd on the back the differences are 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.360
 especially in the processing of 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.599
 plastic we can see slightly 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.169
 also the arrangement behind the 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.569
 of the contrast casting of lg g3 is done 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.780
 in metal the central one we have also 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:27.379
 the presence of the councilor with the laser 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.300
 for auto focus while g2 is lacking 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.540
 mound of auction a simple plastic though 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.280
 backlit obviously not 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.930
 action that 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.550
 and different to this practically not 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.790
 holds any kind of life and while 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.360
 as you can see the gip web neighborhoods 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.830
 as the arrangement of the 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.800
 speaking lot as a matter must 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.770
 there are three and here on the back and it is also 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.820
 amplified with a boat case 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.919
 while on his g2 we go to the boxes 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.050
 were here on strong opposition 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.139
 change as an appointment and c 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.310
 the amplifier on the fire a little more 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.930
 difficult 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.630
 I can't do a software comparison 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.940
 because on the 62 we have installed one 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.280
 modified rom so we can't do 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.110
 see the interface difference anymore 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.510
 what else was a difference in level 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.770
 even the screens can be dimensional 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:24.500
 see that they have blocked 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.720
 different mentions different brightness 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.849
 try to approach both of them for 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.789
 see if he can focus was 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:35.120
 already difficult to see the pixels on the g2 g3 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:37.310
 it is definitely impossible for this 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.000
 brief comparative is all a greeting a 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.000
 all by tones
