for the track chances are this thing's

for the track chances are this thing's
not<00:00:25.680> gonna<00:00:25.920> work<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
not gonna work for you and this is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.220 
not gonna work for you and this is
typically<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> donkey<00:00:27.599> killer<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
typically a donkey killer because the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
typically a donkey killer because the
width<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> rails<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.429> fit<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> pegs<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
width of the rails to fit the pegs on a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
width of the rails to fit the pegs on a
250cc<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.289> wider<00:00:31.439> than<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
250cc is a little bit wider than the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.319 
250cc is a little bit wider than the
donkey<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.759> times<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> donkey<00:00:33.239> will

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
donkey so a lot of times a donkey will

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.220 
donkey so a lot of times a donkey will
just<00:00:33.450> kind<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.600> slide<00:00:33.899> right<00:00:34.200> through

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
just kind of slide right through

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
just kind of slide right through
handlebars<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> different<00:00:35.640> story<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.239> keep

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
handlebars is a different story but keep

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
handlebars is a different story but keep
in<00:00:36.540> mind<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> those<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.380> things<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
in mind the of those three things the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.900 
in mind the of those three things the
only<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.250> gonna<00:00:38.370> give<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> any

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
only thing that's gonna give you any

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.430 
only thing that's gonna give you any
kind<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.210> power<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> rear<00:00:40.200> wheel

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
kind of power is gonna be the rear wheel

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
kind of power is gonna be the rear wheel
obviously<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:41.940> gonna<00:00:42.000> use

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
obviously right and you're gonna use

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.580 
obviously right and you're gonna use
that<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.690> give<00:00:42.840> yourself<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> momentum

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that to give yourself the momentum

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.350 
that to give yourself the momentum
needed<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> clear<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> gap<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
needed to clear like a gap like this and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
needed to clear like a gap like this and
then<00:00:45.450> rehook<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> rear<00:00:46.200> tire<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:46.710> make

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
then rehook the rear tire and then make

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.799 
then rehook the rear tire and then make
it<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.340> Virts<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> beauties

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it up this Virts and one of the beauties

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
it up this Virts and one of the beauties
of<00:00:48.840> rails<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> mistake

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
of rails is that you can make a mistake

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
of rails is that you can make a mistake
and<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> almost<00:00:51.809> always<00:00:52.260> correct<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and you can almost always correct it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.319 
and you can almost always correct it
because<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.520> long<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:54.000> wheels<00:00:54.180> are

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
because as long as your wheels are

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
because as long as your wheels are
hooked<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.690> you're<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.350> anywhere<00:00:55.590> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
hooked here you're not going anywhere so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.110 
hooked here you're not going anywhere so
if<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.100> need<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> release<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> gas<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> little

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
if you need to release the gas a little

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299 
if you need to release the gas a little
bit<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.719> try<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:58.829> room<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
bit to try to get a little more room to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
bit to try to get a little more room to
build<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> crawl<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.960> thing<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
build up to crawl up this thing then you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
build up to crawl up this thing then you
can<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> another<00:01:02.670> tip<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> don't<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.180> an

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
can and another tip that I don't have an

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.359 
can and another tip that I don't have an
example<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.500> hang<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
example of if you can hang from it you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
example of if you can hang from it you
can<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.729> top<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> times

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
can right on top of it so a lot of times

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
can right on top of it so a lot of times
these<00:01:07.409> guys<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.770> put<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.549> jumps<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
these guys will put in these jumps that

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
these guys will put in these jumps that
require<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.890> wheel<00:01:11.130> hook

then<00:01:18.990> clear<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> jump<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
then clear a jump on the other side it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.160 
then clear a jump on the other side it
sounds<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.270> complicated<00:01:21.900> than<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
sounds a lot more complicated than it is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.660 
sounds a lot more complicated than it is
but<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.159> ride<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.490> top

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
but just know that you could ride on top

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
but just know that you could ride on top
of<00:01:23.880> almost<00:01:24.270> every<00:01:24.600> set<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> rails<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.439> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
of almost every set of rails that you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
of almost every set of rails that you
can<00:01:25.650> hang<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.270> next<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> rear<00:01:27.930> wheel

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can hang from next up is the rear wheel

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
can hang from next up is the rear wheel
bounce<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.970> tricky<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bounce this can be a little tricky to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
bounce this can be a little tricky to
pull<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> times<00:01:31.560> you're

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pull off because a lot of times you're

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.240 
pull off because a lot of times you're
falling<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.509> high<00:01:33.750> ledge<00:01:34.740> to

falling from a very a very high ledge to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.010 
falling from a very a very high ledge to
land<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> thing<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.180> bounced<00:01:36.540> over

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
land on this thing and then bounced over

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
land on this thing and then bounced over
a<00:01:37.049> gap<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> other<00:01:37.950> side<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.610> once<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
a gap on to the other side but once you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.190 
a gap on to the other side but once you
get<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> down<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.630> nail<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.900> every

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
get it down you can just nail it every

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
get it down you can just nail it every
time<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> hit

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
time and you don't always have to hit

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
time and you don't always have to hit
with<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> rear<00:01:43.170> wheel<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> front

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159

tire<00:01:44.369> hits<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.180> fine<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
tire hits a little bit it's fine like in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
tire hits a little bit it's fine like in
this<00:01:45.869> example<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> main<00:01:47.070> goal<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this example here but the main goal is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370 
this example here but the main goal is
to<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> rear<00:01:48.299> wheel<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.720> compress<00:01:49.140> all

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to get that rear wheel to compress all

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
to get that rear wheel to compress all
the<00:01:49.619> way<00:01:49.710> down<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.040> far<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the way down as far as it can and then

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
the way down as far as it can and then
the<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> pushes<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.829> off<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the second it pushes you off as you can

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.830 
the second it pushes you off as you can
see<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> ultra<00:01:54.210> slow<00:01:54.240> mode<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
see right here in ultra slow mode it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
see right here in ultra slow mode it
pushes<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> off<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pushes you off you see you have that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.510 
pushes you off you see you have that
lift<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> correct<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.219> moving

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
lift then you can correct it by moving

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
lift then you can correct it by moving
the<00:01:59.820> joystick<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.570> forth<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> give

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the joystick back and forth to give

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.719 
the joystick back and forth to give
yourself<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.799> bunny<00:02:02.040> hop<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
yourself what was like a bunny hop to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.160 
yourself what was like a bunny hop to
give<00:02:02.939> yourself<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> little<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.960> time

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
give yourself a little bit more time

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.929 
give yourself a little bit more time
converting<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.799> lift<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.520> something

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
converting that lift into something

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.399 
converting that lift into something
usable<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.600> gonna<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.020> clearing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
usable which is gonna be you clearing

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.010 
usable which is gonna be you clearing
this<00:02:07.530> gap<00:02:07.770> almost<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> little<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
this gap almost use a little bit of the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.570 
this gap almost use a little bit of the
faff<00:02:10.200> technique<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.920> make<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> other<00:02:11.400> side

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
faff technique to make it the other side

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 
faff technique to make it the other side
and<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:12.030> pretty<00:02:12.239> much<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.660> naki

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and that's pretty much it naki

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.569 
and that's pretty much it naki
this<00:02:13.409> in<00:02:13.530> mind<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.829> don't<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.340> have

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
this in mind you don't have to have

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.490 
this in mind you don't have to have
three<00:02:14.969> separate<00:02:15.299> platforms<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.959> qualify<00:02:16.349> as<00:02:16.469> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
three separate platforms to qualify as a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.899 
three separate platforms to qualify as a
rear<00:02:16.769> wheel<00:02:16.920> hop<00:02:17.219> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.519> actually<00:02:17.760> apply

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
rear wheel hop you can actually apply

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.179 
rear wheel hop you can actually apply
this<00:02:18.030> pretty<00:02:18.450> much<00:02:18.569> anywhere<00:02:19.049> anytime<00:02:19.409> you're

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
this pretty much anywhere anytime you're

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.759 
this pretty much anywhere anytime you're
let's<00:02:20.670> say<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.879> overshoot<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.840> catch<00:02:22.409> ramp

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
let's say if you overshoot a catch ramp

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.229 
let's say if you overshoot a catch ramp
and<00:02:23.040> there's<00:02:23.340> another<00:02:23.640> ramp<00:02:23.909> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> other

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and there's another ramp on the other

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.479 
and there's another ramp on the other
side<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:24.959> hit<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.319> ramp<00:02:25.739> with<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.310> rear

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
side you can hit that ramp with the rear

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.699 
side you can hit that ramp with the rear
wheel<00:02:26.519> down<00:02:26.969> first<00:02:27.359> okay<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.560> can

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
wheel down first okay and you can

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.649 
wheel down first okay and you can
probably<00:02:29.040> give<00:02:29.400> yourself<00:02:29.730> enough<00:02:30.120> lift<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
probably give yourself enough lift to

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.210 
probably give yourself enough lift to
clear<00:02:31.019> whatever's<00:02:31.379> on<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.560> other<00:02:31.590> side

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
clear whatever's on the other side

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.339 
clear whatever's on the other side
finally<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.030> reverse<00:02:33.329> uphill<00:02:33.900> wheelie<00:02:34.319> or

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
finally the reverse uphill wheelie or

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.199 
finally the reverse uphill wheelie or
uphill<00:02:34.739> reverse<00:02:35.040> wheelie<00:02:35.340> or<00:02:35.519> really<00:02:35.879> reverse

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
uphill reverse wheelie or really reverse

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.729 
uphill reverse wheelie or really reverse
uphill<00:02:36.569> whatever<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.109> call<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.409> it

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
uphill whatever you want to call it it

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.149 
uphill whatever you want to call it it
is<00:02:38.359> extremely<00:02:39.359> easy<00:02:39.659> looking<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.769> mean<00:02:41.010> look<00:02:41.129> at

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
is extremely easy looking I mean look at

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.410 
is extremely easy looking I mean look at
the<00:02:41.250> controller<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.790> looks<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.329> just

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the controller it looks like it's just

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.479 
the controller it looks like it's just
this<00:02:42.840> little<00:02:43.139> movement<00:02:43.620> side<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.889> side<00:02:44.099> but

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
this little movement side to side but

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.330 
this little movement side to side but
it's<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.090> difficult<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:46.260> perfect<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.859> now

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it's so difficult to perfect this now

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.500 
it's so difficult to perfect this now
the<00:02:47.400> best<00:02:47.609> way<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.790> approach<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.180> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
the best way to approach this is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.210 
the best way to approach this is
perfecting<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.109> one<00:02:49.290> step<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.739> time<00:02:49.799> okay

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
perfecting it one step at a time okay

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.830 
perfecting it one step at a time okay
there's<00:02:50.400> basically<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.359> two<00:02:51.569> steps

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
there's basically about like two steps

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.629 
there's basically about like two steps
the<00:02:51.989> first<00:02:52.079> step<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.709> getting<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.280> front<00:02:53.519> end

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
the first step is getting the front end

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.920 
the first step is getting the front end
off<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.939> ground<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> second<00:02:54.540> steps<00:02:54.689> gonna<00:02:54.870> be

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
off the ground the second steps gonna be

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.599 
off the ground the second steps gonna be
actually<00:02:55.079> working<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.709> incline<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
actually working that incline so to

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.789 
actually working that incline so to
tackle<00:02:56.760> step<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.329> simply<00:02:57.840> load<00:02:58.049> up<00:02:58.200> any<00:02:58.439> track

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
tackle step one simply load up any track

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.470 
tackle step one simply load up any track
that<00:02:58.980> has<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.129> flat<00:02:59.519> surface<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.909> start<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.329> on

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
that has a flat surface to start out on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.819 
that has a flat surface to start out on
just<00:03:00.750> load<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.019> up<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.500> second<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
just load it up and the second the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.140 
just load it up and the second the
countdown<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.250> done<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.669> start<00:03:02.849> wiggling

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
countdown is done just start wiggling

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.550 
countdown is done just start wiggling
the<00:03:03.450> rider<00:03:03.659> back<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.049> forth<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.439> it

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the rider back and forth that's it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.289 
the rider back and forth that's it
you're<00:03:04.650> gonna<00:03:04.739> notice<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.159> leave<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.060> front

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you're gonna notice that leave the front

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.759 
you're gonna notice that leave the front
or<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.659> back<00:03:06.689> tires<00:03:07.019> aren't<00:03:07.290> coming<00:03:07.530> off<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
or the back tires aren't coming off the

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.080 
or the back tires aren't coming off the
ground<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.189> then<00:03:08.459> once<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.669> get<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.879> front

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
ground and then once I get that front

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.789 
ground and then once I get that front
tire<00:03:09.239> off<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.419> ground<00:03:09.750> make<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.500> you

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
tire off the ground make it so that you

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.159 
tire off the ground make it so that you
can<00:03:10.950> hold<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.489> at<00:03:11.760> about<00:03:11.879> 45<00:03:12.450> degrees<00:03:12.840> or<00:03:13.019> so

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
can hold it up at about 45 degrees or so

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.690 
can hold it up at about 45 degrees or so
for<00:03:13.379> like<00:03:13.620> three<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.980> five<00:03:14.159> seconds<00:03:14.579> that's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
for like three to five seconds that's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.289 
for like three to five seconds that's
all<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:14.970> takes

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
all it takes

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.849 
all it takes
it's<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.169> have<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.349> do<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.590> from<00:03:16.680> what

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
it's and you have to do it from what

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.099 
it's and you have to do it from what
from<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.069> standstill<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:17.849> remember<00:03:18.750> we're

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
from a standstill because remember we're

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
from a standstill because remember we're
going<00:03:19.229> backwards<00:03:19.799> here<00:03:20.129> so<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.549> want<00:03:20.729> to<00:03:20.849> get

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
going backwards here so you want to get

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.610 
going backwards here so you want to get
that<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.419> right<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.870> once<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.260> have<00:03:22.379> it<00:03:22.409> up

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that just right and once you have it up

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.349 
that just right and once you have it up
try<00:03:23.099> moving<00:03:23.489> back<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.669> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.090> just

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
try moving back a little bit just

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.270 
try moving back a little bit just
releasing<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> brake<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.109> little<00:03:25.260> right<00:03:26.099> and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
releasing the brake a little right and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.259 
releasing the brake a little right and
just<00:03:26.430> try<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.579> move<00:03:26.729> it<00:03:26.879> back<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.239> a

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
just try to move it back you're on a

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.670 
just try to move it back you're on a
flat<00:03:27.510> surface<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:27.989> gonna<00:03:28.109> be<00:03:28.229> harder<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
flat surface it's gonna be harder you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.780 
flat surface it's gonna be harder you
might<00:03:28.829> have<00:03:28.919> to<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.069> hop<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> little

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
might have to actually hop it a little

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.539 
might have to actually hop it a little
bit<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.449> once<00:03:30.659> you<00:03:30.750> perfect<00:03:31.079> this<00:03:31.379> there<00:03:31.859> this

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
bit but once you perfect this there this

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.610 
bit but once you perfect this there this
is<00:03:32.729> this<00:03:32.940> actually<00:03:33.359> kind<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> reverse<00:03:34.379> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
is this actually kind of the reverse of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.530 
is this actually kind of the reverse of
the<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.310> faff<00:03:35.579> technique<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.120> lot<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.329> times

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the the faff technique a lot of times

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.849 
the the faff technique a lot of times
when<00:03:36.900> you're<00:03:37.019> doing<00:03:37.229> the<00:03:37.319> phat<00:03:37.530> technique

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
when you're doing the phat technique

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:38.990 
when you're doing the phat technique
you'll<00:03:37.979> notice<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.549> don't<00:03:38.790> quite<00:03:38.940> have

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you'll notice that you don't quite have

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.699 
you'll notice that you don't quite have
enough<00:03:39.180> room<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.629> get<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.049> rear<00:03:40.290> wheel<00:03:40.440> on

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
enough room to get your rear wheel on

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.080 
enough room to get your rear wheel on
the<00:03:40.829> platform<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.699> you're<00:03:41.790> gonna<00:03:41.879> start<00:03:42.030> doing

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
the platform so you're gonna start doing

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.629 
the platform so you're gonna start doing
a<00:03:42.299> bunnyhop<00:03:42.750> while<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.169> your<00:03:43.440> front<00:03:43.769> tire<00:03:44.010> to

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
a bunnyhop while on your front tire to

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.369 
a bunnyhop while on your front tire to
move<00:03:44.879> the<00:03:45.030> bike<00:03:45.180> forward<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.840> exact<00:03:46.199> same

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
move the bike forward this exact same

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.170 
move the bike forward this exact same
thing<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.799> backwards<00:03:46.979> alright<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.030> got

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
thing but backwards alright so you got

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.300 
thing but backwards alright so you got
that<00:03:48.359> step<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.049> just<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.769> up<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.979> hill<00:03:50.099> no

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
that step to just go up the hill no

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.969 
that step to just go up the hill no
problem<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.930> here's<00:03:52.109> what<00:03:52.199> you<00:03:52.290> lie<00:03:52.379> do<00:03:52.440> you

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
problem so here's what you lie do you

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.680 
problem so here's what you lie do you
want<00:03:53.159> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.519> platform<00:03:53.729> get<00:03:54.209> as<00:03:54.329> close

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
want to be on this platform get as close

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.319 
want to be on this platform get as close
to<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:55.799> crease<00:03:56.220> here<00:03:56.489> where<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.090> ramp

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
to the crease here where the the ramp

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.640 
to the crease here where the the ramp
actually<00:03:57.659> begins<00:03:57.900> at<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.079> base<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.470> ramp

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
actually begins at the base of the ramp

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.679 
actually begins at the base of the ramp
and<00:03:58.889> then<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.849> do<00:04:00.030> your<00:04:00.180> little<00:04:00.239> wheelie

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
and then you do your little wheelie

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.080 
and then you do your little wheelie
thing<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.199> if<00:04:01.439> you're<00:04:01.530> too<00:04:01.709> far<00:04:02.010> away<00:04:02.370> from

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
thing and if you're too far away from

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.610 
thing and if you're too far away from
the<00:04:03.449> base<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.019> ramp<00:04:04.199> then<00:04:04.439> you're<00:04:04.530> gonna

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
the base of the ramp then you're gonna

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.899 
the base of the ramp then you're gonna
just<00:04:04.829> fall<00:04:05.010> over<00:04:05.040> backwards<00:04:05.370> you're<00:04:05.819> gonna

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
just fall over backwards you're gonna

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.039 
just fall over backwards you're gonna
have<00:04:06.030> marked<00:04:06.239> I'm<00:04:06.329> just<00:04:06.510> actually<00:04:06.720> getting<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
have marked I'm just actually getting to

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.530 
have marked I'm just actually getting to
it<00:04:07.169> so<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.709> closer<00:04:07.919> you<00:04:08.040> are<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:09.120> crease

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
it so the closer you are to that crease

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.149 
it so the closer you are to that crease
the<00:04:10.199> better<00:04:10.409> your<00:04:10.560> chances<00:04:10.859> are<00:04:10.979> I'm<00:04:11.129> just

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
the better your chances are I'm just

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.069 
the better your chances are I'm just
getting<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.579> started<00:04:12.060> once<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.810> get<00:04:12.959> it

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
getting the started once you get it

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.170 
getting the started once you get it
started<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:14.489> when<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.879> gets<00:04:14.970> difficult

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
started that's when it gets difficult

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.879 
started that's when it gets difficult
it's<00:04:15.659> gonna<00:04:15.780> feel<00:04:16.109> weird<00:04:16.409> you're<00:04:16.769> always

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
it's gonna feel weird you're always

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.379 
it's gonna feel weird you're always
gonna<00:04:17.039> feel<00:04:17.370> like<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.060> basically

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
gonna feel like and this is basically

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.250 
gonna feel like and this is basically
what<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.750> you're<00:04:19.289> delaying<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
what it is you're delaying the the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.149 
what it is you're delaying the the
mechanic<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.409> says<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.830> shouldn't<00:04:23.099> be

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
mechanic that says that you shouldn't be

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.830 
mechanic that says that you shouldn't be
flipping<00:04:23.460> over<00:04:23.550> backwards<00:04:23.669> you're<00:04:24.450> simply

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
flipping over backwards you're simply

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.779 
flipping over backwards you're simply
delaying<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.800> once<00:04:26.039> you<00:04:26.159> start<00:04:26.250> going<00:04:26.520> up

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
delaying it so once you start going up

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.260 
delaying it so once you start going up
the<00:04:26.909> hill<00:04:27.029> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the hill this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.339 
the hill this
where<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.629> gets<00:04:27.810> tricky<00:04:27.990> because<00:04:28.229> you're

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
where it gets tricky because you're

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.409 
where it gets tricky because you're
gonna<00:04:28.470> have<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.770> very<00:04:29.190> very<00:04:29.490> carefully

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
gonna have to very very carefully

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.170 
gonna have to very very carefully
correct<00:04:30.900> little<00:04:31.650> tiny<00:04:32.220> inconsistencies

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
correct little tiny inconsistencies

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.939 
correct little tiny inconsistencies
little<00:04:33.690> balance<00:04:34.080> issues<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.710> you're<00:04:34.800> gonna

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
little balance issues that you're gonna

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.439 
little balance issues that you're gonna
you're<00:04:35.280> gonna<00:04:35.340> come<00:04:35.610> up<00:04:35.729> on<00:04:35.879> I<00:04:36.090> mean<00:04:36.300> you're

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
you're gonna come up on I mean you're

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.089 
you're gonna come up on I mean you're
gonna<00:04:36.569> be<00:04:36.720> gunning<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.319> left<00:04:37.530> trigger<00:04:37.800> okay

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
gonna be gunning the left trigger okay

gonna be gunning the left trigger okay
so<00:04:38.310> you're<00:04:38.759> gonna<00:04:38.879> be<00:04:39.000> gunning<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.479> reverse

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
so you're gonna be gunning the reverse

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.450 
so you're gonna be gunning the reverse
you're<00:04:40.139> not<00:04:40.319> gonna<00:04:40.470> touch<00:04:40.680> anything<00:04:41.159> else

you're not gonna touch anything else
it's<00:04:41.819> gonna<00:04:42.030> be<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.780> your<00:04:43.080> joystick<00:04:43.680> okay

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
it's gonna be just your joystick okay

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.460 
it's gonna be just your joystick okay
your<00:04:44.280> your<00:04:44.310> lean<00:04:44.669> ability<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.360> be<00:04:46.080> reverse

the rear wheel make its own way over the
lip<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.220> then<00:05:08.690> bring<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.810> rest<00:05:09.990> back<00:05:10.110> around

and that's it you're done you've now

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.969 
and that's it you're done you've now
learned<00:05:12.900> how<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.080> do<00:05:13.229> everything<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.860> this

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
learned how to do everything in this

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.219 
learned how to do everything in this
track<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:14.550> not<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:15.060> difficult<00:05:15.360> go<00:05:16.110> ahead

up once the market kind of falls back
into<00:05:20.909> place<00:05:21.120> get<00:05:21.509> another<00:05:21.870> track<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.199> he's

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
into place get another track that he's

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.200 
into place get another track that he's
gonna<00:05:22.530> put<00:05:22.770> up<00:05:22.860> that's<00:05:23.039> gonna<00:05:23.130> allow<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.490> to

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
gonna put up that's gonna allow you to

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.610 
gonna put up that's gonna allow you to
use<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.659> left<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:24.870> right<00:05:24.960> bumpers<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.469> move

use the left and right bumpers to move
in<00:05:25.710> between<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:25.979> checkpoints<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:26.580> allow<00:05:26.699> you

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
in between the checkpoints so allow you

if<00:05:29.159> you<00:05:29.280> need<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.669> but<00:05:29.969> even<00:05:30.210> though<00:05:30.300> we're

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
if you need to but even though we're

if you need to but even though we're
giving<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.719> very<00:05:30.960> specific<00:05:31.440> obstacles<00:05:31.710> to

giving you very specific obstacles to
practice<00:05:32.310> all<00:05:32.430> these<00:05:32.580> things<00:05:32.819> on<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.210> can

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
practice all these things on you can

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240 
practice all these things on you can
take<00:05:33.539> these<00:05:33.750> these<00:05:34.500> new<00:05:34.620> techniques<00:05:35.009> and

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
take these these new techniques and

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.129 
take these these new techniques and
everything<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.669> apply<00:05:35.909> them<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.389> tracks

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
everything and apply them to tracks

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.749 
everything and apply them to tracks
where<00:05:37.409> maybe<00:05:37.949> that<00:05:38.159> wasn't<00:05:38.340> even<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
where maybe that wasn't even the

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.909 
where maybe that wasn't even the
intention<00:05:39.300> of<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.870> Creator<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.440> for<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:40.800> to

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
intention of the Creator to for you to

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.070 
intention of the Creator to for you to
use<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.460> rear<00:05:41.940> wheel<00:05:42.090> hop<00:05:42.419> or<00:05:42.659> the<00:05:42.779> faff

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
use a rear wheel hop or the faff

use a rear wheel hop or the faff
technique<00:05:43.590> or<00:05:44.009> even<00:05:44.400> rails<00:05:44.669> rails<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.300> good

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
technique or even rails rails is a good

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.059 
technique or even rails rails is a good
one<00:05:45.659> because<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.930> lot<00:05:46.169> of<00:05:46.199> creators<00:05:46.650> don't<00:05:46.860> take

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
one because a lot of creators don't take

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.620 
one because a lot of creators don't take
into<00:05:47.250> account<00:05:47.279> the<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.759> fact<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.389> can

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
into account the the fact that you can

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.200 
into account the the fact that you can
ride<00:05:49.110> both<00:05:49.500> sides<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:50.069> these<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.460> build<00:05:50.909> up

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
ride both sides of these and build up

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.149 
ride both sides of these and build up
just<00:05:51.509> incredible<00:05:52.050> amounts<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:52.409> control<00:05:53.039> of

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
just incredible amounts of control of

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.709 
just incredible amounts of control of
speed<00:05:53.460> because<00:05:53.729> remember<00:05:53.940> you're<00:05:54.449> hooked

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
speed because remember you're hooked

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:55.700 
speed because remember you're hooked
onto<00:05:54.930> this<00:05:55.139> thing<00:05:55.289> you're<00:05:55.409> not<00:05:55.440> going

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
onto this thing you're not going

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.709 
onto this thing you're not going
anywhere<00:05:55.979> so<00:05:56.550> flying<00:05:57.029> off<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.300> end<00:05:57.569> of<00:05:57.659> this

anywhere so flying off the end of this
thing<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:57.990> clearing<00:05:58.319> half<00:05:58.469> the<00:05:58.590> track<00:05:58.830> is

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
thing and clearing half the track is

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.589 
thing and clearing half the track is
definitely<00:05:59.400> not<00:05:59.490> unheard<00:05:59.759> of<00:05:59.940> so<00:06:00.479> that
