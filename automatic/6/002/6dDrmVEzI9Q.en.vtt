00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.220
 all great and today I would like you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.710
 show such a cool program 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
 which allows you to wind the knife yes you do not 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 misheard she lets you twist the knife 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 even two knives a day a day to two 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 knives and this is absolute truth well 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.630
 at least it works now and more 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 and today I'll show you how it is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 and going to start take a look about 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 inventory and consists of exactly 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.769
 nothing 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 there are new caramel apple which 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 there are 11 cents and a dota box 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.410
 I also have nothing to do with the incentive too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 there is nothing in general barge inventory 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.059
 literally go to another site 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
 choose a knife up to 100 bucks in this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.570
 the program can be screwed up to 100 knife 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.340
 bucks and quality falls 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 random that is if you want there 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.699
 worn will fall out after the field then not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 take offense 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.710
 In general, we choose to search for knives that were 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 easier and sort them by price from cheap 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 Here we have sorted as needed 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 the result hook immediately disappears 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.060
 quality is also not particularly pay attention 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.740
 what kind of we will be there just 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 need now coloring the very shape of the knife 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.189
 so let's get some bayonet knife 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 choose how much they stand there the most 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.700
 Cheap for the cheapest such to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.070
 100 bucks 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.820
 not yet here first went 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.299
 African net me beautiful 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 pixel camo is also not very weak 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.049
 North's hunting knife here by the way 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:42.619
 not bad think pixel camouflage 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:47.240
 bayonet knife is not particularly here still have 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.179
 burns stat track folding I want no 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.399
 I want to fold something ugly about bayonet 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.009
 field burns 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.750
 don't know dead looks might get lucky 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.729
 and after the field and will fall out because he 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.450
 looks pretty good not much 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.590
 shabby well, that's opening the program here 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.729
 she looks like this 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.599
 we enter insert the name of the knife and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.340
 press the drop button wait while the strip 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:22.760
 boot comes to the end 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 oh, written, thank you 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.280
 wait your item for a minute 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.610
 go in the hut make sure again punks and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.850
 there's nothing 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.380
 wait until the dishes but only come estima 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.620
 yes even not kidnapped have a knife come 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:45.660
 We look at the quality after the field 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:50.790
 How much is $ 77 and it is but a circle 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.060
 78 fine he we have is watching ours 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060
 inventory 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.050
 here he is a bayonet knife burns he has us 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.570
 It appeared so well that we will not miss the chance and 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.520
 screw the second knife let's screw 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.410
 perhaps a hunting knife of some kind 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:13.260
 choose yet though not really don't know 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:18.660
 c nut can not be the price of course 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:24.060
 great but i think something can be 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.739
 try 137 surface hardening slightly 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.280
 dear some let's sort by 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.560
 price choose so burns do not want one more 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.270
 it will be a lot but the city maxim 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.299
 disguise on cheap yourself let's 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.620
 something a little bit more expensive night night 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.480
 $ 83 worn really look 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.280
 what coloring will be our main 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.519
 the form itself can be clicking repeat 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.650
 so we choose at least this try 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.160
 screw it up again so let's roll 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.160
 pram 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.730
 open the program here it programs 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.440
 paste here 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.500
 night hunting knife push drop waiting 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.790

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.880
 and given 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.940
 scenes expect your subject to flow 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.430

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.620

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.530
 rabanne her fraction and we look quality and 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.630
 this well-worn let's see now 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.370
 the price of how much the knife fell worn even 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:45.050
 more expensive is full of battle-hardened 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.360
 it is night now and even its price is interesting 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.050
 and make a little bit easier inventory 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.770
 at the same time look at the cup hustles 94 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.150
