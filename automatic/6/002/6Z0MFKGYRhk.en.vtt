00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone and today will be the first video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.269
 which is called this or that and begin 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.389
 we are with makeup rouge or bronzer 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.340
 I donâ€™t really like blush with bronzer 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.369
 can visit have learned 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.980
 maybe I did not find my own if I told them 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.260
 I use it only in summer 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.400
 winter is very very rare tonal basis 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.080
 or concealer concealer because I 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 I think that the ends can be covered 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 of course not all faces 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.309
 but the circles under the eyes are some irregularities 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 skin and in principle it is enough to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 skin looked good lip gloss or 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 lipstick lip gloss uniquely lipstick i 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 buy buy 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 but don't use don't like them a shine for 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.030
 I like to use my lips, but in general I silently 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.030
 it is hygienic lipstick or balm 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 brush or sponge children bender that is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.780
 accordingly, I still have spans 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 I use it a little dirty 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.950
 every day I really like tassels 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 tried to apply tonal sleep skill 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.270
 like it like that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 beauty blender well again maybe i don't 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.970
 I found my brush but it seems to me that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.610
 beauty br especially wet very thin 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 very well distribute tonal 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.720
 the basis of the police is very good concealer 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 distributes they can highlighter cause 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 bronzer general multifunctional hiv 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.130
 put out eyeliners let's say so with 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 eyeliner without mascara I will not go out 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 asth through eyeliners and you yes 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 probably still the carcass though I would choose and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.600
 both together because I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.790
 like when i have eyeliner on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 eyes even let it be the thinnest 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.409
 very neat and mascara 1 and 4 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 pressed shadows pressed 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.000
 it's much more convenient for me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.229
 and even if they are dust from but just 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 more comfortable somehow gaining I don't know who 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.500
 someone likes friable shadows share 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.070
 please natural or colored shadows 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.560
 I certainly love the color, I just love 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.530
 us one second to purple green 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 yellow orange about me like it but 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.290
 they are always like this in clubs 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.959
 I now do not go to any yes there 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.069
 evening and night activities where too 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.340
 such make-up would be appropriate therefore 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.739
 I love bright but I use natural 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 nails essential rose 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.430
 never tried us essence 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 me one varnish trying neither and the other 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.940
 essence nothing special shit once i'm not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.319
 I tried long or short nails 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.299
 probably all the same for a short not somehow 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.730
 Looks neat though very much earlier 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.380
 loved long and tried them all 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.120
 I never grow this up 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.030
 It turned out now as I grow up 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.519
 nails are very good and very strong me and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.019
 all time I shoot light or dark 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.670
 dark lacquer tones i like when 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.560
 nail polish accent though 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.079
 as a continuation on some finger 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.200
 beige nudes in mood but 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:17.459
 still big like bright dark 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.959
 toilet water and steam or parfum i can 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.299
 to be not very good at it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.310
 i like this other some there 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.310
 promo grand difference in persistence in 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.310
 the scent 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.070
 fragrances so I do not notice and then 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.230
 another I'm not paying much attention 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.680
 when buying toilet water or a pier 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.340
 body oil or cream used to be very 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.200
 loved oils and natural but 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.690
 Now I give preference after all 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.739
 cream because the oil is sometimes 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.850
 lays down like a skin like a film 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.470
 tissue paper is registered 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.430
 soaked in oil let it stay 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.950
 dry and oily somehow not always 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.420
 you can guess what kind of oil you will approach 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.470
 so now the cream and quite happy 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 lozhili dolce milk or any other matter 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.980
 don't like very much smell from dolce 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.760
 milk Yes, I used to thin 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.919
 especially not see fashion jeans leggings 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.320
 jeans jeans jeans jeans 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.780

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.389
 I will 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.430
 length or short sleeve 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.840
 short i mean i am most comfortable 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.270
 feel either t-shirts or t-shirts knife 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.940
 in the extreme case, three-quarter sleeve 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.729
 skirt or dress dress because Kiev 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.160
 cinema and then pick up a dress there 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.030
 the accessories department added experience chose 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.590
 everything pays girl yes me more 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.690
 like a plan than squirrels definitely 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.010
 the fact that in Komi there is, but somehow I have 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.729

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.590
 T-shirts know with cartoon characters 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.110

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.889
 accessories 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.710

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.240
 I can not find as well as 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.919
 pawns hair long or short 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.060
 of course length 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:51.120
 but I am between the lengths of the shoulders all that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.450
 higher for me is short hair not 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.450

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.340
 long hair except childhood me 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.010
 really like long hair at all 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.669
 girls somehow don't know it gives me 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.190
 femininity and 9 which goes short 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.350
 hairstyle and they still remain 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.470
 feminine 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.860
 beautiful it is very cool some 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.960

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.010

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.150
