maybe they were nominated for like some

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.410 
maybe they were nominated for like some
sort<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.930> b-list<00:00:25.859> award<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.519> still<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.269> mean

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
sort of b-list award but still I mean

picture<00:01:16.500> comedy<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.369> musical<00:01:17.400> pause<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
picture comedy or musical pause for a

picture comedy or musical pause for a
second<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.080> hate<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.009> they<00:01:20.460> put<00:01:20.700> comedy

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
second I hate it that they put comedy

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.140 
second I hate it that they put comedy
and<00:01:21.360> musical<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.740> same<00:01:23.009> category<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and musical in the same category it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
and musical in the same category it
doesn't<00:01:24.509> make<00:01:24.570> any<00:01:24.750> sense<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.409> lame<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
doesn't make any sense because lame is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
doesn't make any sense because lame is
is<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.759> category<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.509> lame<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is in this category and lame is is a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.200 
is in this category and lame is is a
drama<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.340> musicals<00:01:29.759> shouldn't<00:01:30.090> count

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
drama I think musicals shouldn't count

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
drama I think musicals shouldn't count
they<00:01:30.689> should<00:01:30.869> either<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> drama<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
they should either be a drama or a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
they should either be a drama or a
comedy<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.630> needs<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
comedy I don't think that it needs to be
