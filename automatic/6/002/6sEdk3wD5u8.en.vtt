there if it's bright enough you want to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.170 
there if it's bright enough you want to
disconnect<00:00:34.420> that<00:00:34.750> or<00:00:35.680> else<00:00:35.970> you're<00:00:36.970> going<00:00:37.090> to

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.319 
pull it apart when you take the radiator
out<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.750> then<00:00:40.899> one<00:00:41.110> right<00:00:41.140> here<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.239> just

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
out and then one right here so it just

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.600 
out and then one right here so it just
looks<00:00:43.660> like<00:00:43.750> this<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.739> it'll<00:00:44.950> pull<00:00:45.160> apart<00:00:45.190> you

looks like this and it'll pull apart you

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.750 
looks like this and it'll pull apart you
just<00:00:45.760> kind<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.000> press<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.840> then<00:00:46.960> pull

just kind of press on that and then pull
easy<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:49.420> want<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.690> unscrew<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.380> radiator

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
easy you want to unscrew the radiator

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.220 
easy you want to unscrew the radiator
cap<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.490> release<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.120> pressure<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:55.270> if

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
cap to release the pressure and then if

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.230 
cap to release the pressure and then if
you<00:00:56.350> look<00:00:56.530> down<00:00:56.890> on<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:58.090> side<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.460> kind<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:00.970> get

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
you look down on the side so kind of get

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.789 
you look down on the side so kind of get
disoriented<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.829> down<00:01:03.100> in<00:01:03.370> here<00:01:04.470> you'll<00:01:05.470> see<00:01:05.770> a

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
disoriented so down in here you'll see a

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.340 
disoriented so down in here you'll see a
part<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.430> looks<00:01:06.579> like<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.240> you're<00:01:08.200> going

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
part that looks like this you're going

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.580 
part that looks like this you're going
to<00:01:08.409> unscrew<00:01:09.130> this<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.700> all<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.810> water<00:01:11.020> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
to unscrew this and all the water the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.520 
to unscrew this and all the water the
radiator<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.670> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.380> leak<00:01:14.380> out<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:16.530> should

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
radiator is going to leak out and should

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.990 
radiator is going to leak out and should
go<00:01:17.680> through<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:18.009> hole<00:01:18.250> but<00:01:18.430> sometimes<00:01:18.790> it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
go through this hole but sometimes it's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.140 
go through this hole but sometimes it's
like<00:01:19.150> really<00:01:19.510> pressured<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:21.150> sprays

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
like really pressured and it sprays

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.360 
like really pressured and it sprays
everywhere<00:01:22.450> but<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.140> want<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.350> have<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.830> pan

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
everywhere but you want to have a pan

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.260 
everywhere but you want to have a pan
underneath<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.270> car<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.810> catch<00:01:26.560> everything

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
underneath the car to catch everything

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.810 
underneath the car to catch everything
so<00:01:28.270> once<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.840> all<00:01:28.990> drips<00:01:29.650> out<00:01:29.920> you're<00:01:30.640> ready

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
so once that all drips out you're ready

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.690 
so once that all drips out you're ready
to<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:32.740> off<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.040> hoses<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
to take off the hoses here in here so

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.800 
to take off the hoses here in here so
this<00:01:37.210> one's<00:01:37.479> pretty<00:01:37.750> easy<00:01:37.810> just<00:01:38.770> this<00:01:38.950> little

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this one's pretty easy just this little

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.240 
this one's pretty easy just this little
little<00:01:40.810> hose<00:01:41.140> right<00:01:41.440> here<00:01:42.000> comes<00:01:43.000> right<00:01:43.299> off

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
little hose right here comes right off

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.760 
little hose right here comes right off
and<00:01:45.250> then<00:01:46.060> you're<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.080> take<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.470> hose

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and then you're going to take this hose

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.530 
and then you're going to take this hose
off<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:49.299> well<00:01:49.600> as<00:01:49.900> this<00:01:50.740> hose<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.549> it's<00:01:52.360> going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
off as well as this hose and it's going

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.140 
off as well as this hose and it's going
to<00:01:52.630> come<00:01:52.810> off<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:53.140> here<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.490> going<00:01:54.909> to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
to come off of here and it's going to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.359 
to come off of here and it's going to
lift<00:01:55.630> out<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.140> car<00:01:56.409> when<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.770> take<00:01:57.040> the

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
lift out of the car when you take the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
lift out of the car when you take the
whole<00:01:58.030> radiator<00:01:58.540> out

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.800 

sometimes<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.490> get<00:02:06.579> kind<00:02:06.819> of<00:02:06.880> corroded<00:02:07.479> so

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
sometimes it can get kind of corroded so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.229 
sometimes it can get kind of corroded so
if<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.560> don't<00:02:08.769> come<00:02:08.979> off<00:02:09.009> right<00:02:09.670> away<00:02:09.849> just

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
if they don't come off right away just

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.630 
if they don't come off right away just
keep<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.629> tugging<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> last<00:02:11.830> little<00:02:12.129> hose<00:02:12.370> is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
keep on tugging the last little hose is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.479 
keep on tugging the last little hose is
down<00:02:12.879> here<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.200> little<00:02:14.530> metal<00:02:14.830> piece

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
down here it's this little metal piece

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.160 
down here it's this little metal piece
that<00:02:15.519> comes<00:02:15.940> from<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.330> radiator<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.049> you'll

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
that comes from the radiator and you'll

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.280 
that comes from the radiator and you'll
see<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.489> flexible<00:02:18.489> rubber<00:02:19.030> hose<00:02:19.420> right<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:20.019> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
see a flexible rubber hose right here so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350 
see a flexible rubber hose right here so
you<00:02:20.739> want<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> disconnect<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.489> too<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.239> have

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you want to disconnect that too you have

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.650 
you want to disconnect that too you have
one<00:02:22.599> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.860> side<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.269> other<00:02:25.420> side

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.619 
one on the side one on the other side
under<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> fan<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.450> they're<00:02:28.450> pretty

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
under the fan and they're pretty

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.410 
under the fan and they're pretty
annoying<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.700> muscle<00:02:31.060> through<00:02:31.209> it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
annoying just have to muscle through it

and get them off of there this little
bolt<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.470> it's<00:02:35.590> basically<00:02:36.069> just<00:02:36.220> a

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
bolt here and it's basically just a

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.970 
bolt here and it's basically just a
stabilizer<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.569> then<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.950> side

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.210 
stabilizer and then this one on the side
over<00:02:39.459> here<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:40.799> loosen<00:02:41.799> these<00:02:41.920> bolts

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
over here so you just loosen these bolts

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.750 
over here so you just loosen these bolts
and<00:02:42.879> it<00:02:43.180> comes<00:02:43.420> right<00:02:43.690> off

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.380 

so<00:02:47.390> comes<00:02:48.020> right<00:02:48.319> off

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.700 

and<00:02:51.870> now<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.490> loose<00:02:53.790> radiator<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.560> I'm

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
and now you have a loose radiator so I'm

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.490 
and now you have a loose radiator so I'm
going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.010> pull<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.340> out<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.230> it'll<00:02:58.230> probably

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
going to pull it out and it'll probably

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.980 
going to pull it out and it'll probably
leak<00:02:58.830> some<00:02:59.190> more<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.180> side<00:03:00.450> here<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.780> just

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
leak some more on the side here so just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.620 
leak some more on the side here so just
be<00:03:01.200> aware<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.860> not<00:03:02.670> getting<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> on<00:03:03.240> yourself

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
be aware of not getting it on yourself

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.650 
be aware of not getting it on yourself
or<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.310> something<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.520> animals<00:03:06.270> will<00:03:06.390> lick

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
or on something that animals will lick

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.340 
or on something that animals will lick
up<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.130> stuff<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.550> pretty<00:03:08.790> nasty

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
up because this stuff is pretty nasty

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.980 
up because this stuff is pretty nasty
now<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:10.800> gotta<00:03:11.070> lift<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.240> radiator<00:03:12.690> out

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
now you just gotta lift the radiator out

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.890 
now you just gotta lift the radiator out
make<00:03:13.860> sure<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.250> hoses<00:03:14.640> stay<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.420> way

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
make sure the hoses stay out of the way

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:28.230 
make sure the hoses stay out of the way
one<00:03:16.650> hose<00:03:16.890> coming<00:03:17.400> at<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.760> so

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.059 

there<00:03:29.240> we<00:03:29.450> go

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.819 

now<00:03:34.640> you're<00:03:34.909> just<00:03:35.090> got<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.420> get<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> fan<00:03:36.530> off

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
now you're just got to get the fan off

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.470 
now you're just got to get the fan off
so<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.549> have<00:03:37.790> some<00:03:38.739> bolts<00:03:39.739> in<00:03:39.920> here<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.790> then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
so you have some bolts in here and then

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.649 
so you have some bolts in here and then
down<00:03:41.840> here<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.700> should<00:03:43.909> have<00:03:44.030> four<00:03:44.329> and

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
down here so you should have four and

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.539 
down here so you should have four and
then<00:03:45.200> you're<00:03:45.349> just<00:03:45.469> going<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.769> place<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.340> on

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
then you're just going to place it on

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.330 
then you're just going to place it on
the<00:03:46.700> new<00:03:46.819> one<00:03:46.849> right<00:03:47.859> where<00:03:48.859> you<00:03:48.980> see<00:03:49.219> them

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the new one right where you see them

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:59.890 
the new one right where you see them
connect<00:03:57.280> it's<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.340> good<00:03:58.519> idea<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:59.120> just<00:03:59.540> replace

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
connect it's a good idea to just replace

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.649 
connect it's a good idea to just replace
all<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.620> hoses<00:04:01.459> especially<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.180> an<00:04:02.389> old

car<00:04:02.930> like<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.650> haven't<00:04:03.950> done<00:04:04.069> it<00:04:04.219> in

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
car like this so you haven't done it in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.360 
car like this so you haven't done it in
a<00:04:04.430> while<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:05.000> be<00:04:05.659> sure<00:04:05.689> to<00:04:05.870> take<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.769> hose<00:04:07.069> off

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
a while so be sure to take this hose off

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.149 
a while so be sure to take this hose off

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
and then this hose that's now connected

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.589 
and then this hose that's now connected
or<00:04:13.159> that's<00:04:13.340> still<00:04:13.609> connected<00:04:14.150> here<00:04:14.419> and

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
that was attached to this metal tube and

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.070 
that was attached to this metal tube and
I'm<00:04:33.770> putting<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.310> on<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:35.259> new<00:04:36.820> radiator<00:04:38.080> it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
I'm putting it on the new radiator it's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.420 
I'm putting it on the new radiator it's
easier<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.979> put<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.740> while<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:43.039> radiator

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
easier to put this on while the radiator

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.219 
easier to put this on while the radiator
is<00:04:43.610> out<00:04:43.789> of<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.060> car<00:04:44.300> because<00:04:45.080> it's

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
is out of the car because it's

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.029 
is out of the car because it's
impossible<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:46.039> reach<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:47.110> hose<00:04:48.110> clamp<00:04:48.470> under

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
impossible to reach the hose clamp under

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.750 
impossible to reach the hose clamp under
here<00:04:50.080> now<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.289> I<00:04:51.320> have<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.770> hose<00:04:52.130> connected

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
here now that I have this hose connected

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.490 
here now that I have this hose connected
to<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:52.970> radiator<00:04:53.330> that's<00:04:53.659> about<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.080> go<00:04:54.229> in

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
to the radiator that's about to go in

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.649 
to the radiator that's about to go in
it's<00:04:55.310> going<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.669> attach<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.949> this<00:04:58.419> metal<00:04:59.419> tube

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
it's going to attach to this metal tube

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.110 
it's going to attach to this metal tube
that's<00:05:00.080> facing<00:05:00.560> downwards<00:05:01.130> I'm<00:05:01.849> going<00:05:02.030> to

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that's facing downwards I'm going to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.839 
that's facing downwards I'm going to
drop<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.690> radiator<00:05:03.349> into<00:05:05.409> these<00:05:06.409> little

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
drop the radiator into these little

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.089 
drop the radiator into these little
spots<00:05:07.849> right<00:05:08.090> here<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:09.020> right<00:05:09.169> here<00:05:09.530> it's

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
spots right here and right here it's

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.950 
spots right here and right here it's
kind<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.370> like<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.550> rubber<00:05:11.680> kind<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.800> ring<00:05:13.960> thing

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
kind of like a rubber kind of ring thing

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.740 
kind of like a rubber kind of ring thing
where<00:05:15.229> it<00:05:15.349> sits<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:17.060> just<00:05:17.270> want<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.599> kind

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
where it sits on you just want to kind

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.750 
where it sits on you just want to kind
of<00:05:17.870> wiggle<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.380> into<00:05:18.680> place<00:05:19.010> slide<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.639> in

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
of wiggle it into place slide it in

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.029 
of wiggle it into place slide it in
there<00:05:19.909> until

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
there until

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:44.630 
there until
it's<00:05:21.550> it's<00:05:21.849> in<00:05:22.029> the<00:05:22.119> right<00:05:22.240> spot
