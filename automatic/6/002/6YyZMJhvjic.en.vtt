 that is not a transformer but that 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.220
 it's about samus aran or samus aran I do not know 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.680
 as it is based on the name of 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.630

 but good this here we bring samus from 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.460
 the line sigma a line that is like 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.370
 those of arts but 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.030
 I do not know since it's not band and to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 start but just the same is a figure of a 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.090
 line of ridiculously possible figures 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.900
 and with great great amount of detail here 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 we can see samus in his 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.960
 the appearance that many prefer 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.490
 forget about metroid other m that is clear 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.740
 that here is not complaining is not 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.650
 waiting for a man to order 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.970
 do things for 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.750
 to be able to use his suit but the here in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.240
 the fabric very very very beautiful the truth is 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.510
 that already in you the finished the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.990
 shine in the paint 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.899
 golden copper 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.310
 very beautiful the truth is that this figure 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:30.110
 it's amazing very very very father and you 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 hit the camera for some reason 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.910
 it's been a while since it happened to me but 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.180
 good to see you my dear friends 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.100
 very very pretty figure pretty pretty 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.100
 good this is samus aran 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.370
 with a lot of detail is the care in 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.500
 the painting work is sublime the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.760
 really very nice and it's ridiculously 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.890
 possible his this his arms rotate 360 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.420
 degrees if you look at just that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.760
 They must be careful not to leave 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 much your forearms rotate reflect 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.880
 his wrists speak to him and tell them things 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.140
 do not rotate also your cannon be this 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 it is articulable in the normal range 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 his head turns slightly to the sides 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 he does not have 360 range his legs are 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.650
 flex should have a little care 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.430
 with this joint so they do not rub 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 these are like textures 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.019
 gomÃ  must be careful not to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.550
 those two those two rub like rubbers that 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.220
 has it there but the doll is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 I say is the figure, well, if you 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.530
 they want to call it in some way is 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.430
 ridiculously possible 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.430
 there is 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.360
 if you want to maintain a pose 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.560
 well, like the sigma 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.800
 and its stand 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.650
 here is that you can put it 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.250
 here 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 and while you find the balance 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 they can 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.380
 You can put it as you want 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.510
 shooting up 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.990
 there is 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.010
 very nice the truth is that it is quite 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.830
 pretty pretty this figure and well as 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.100
 we know because he already has 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.280
 have options for us to the xxi 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.590
 we go to an accessory that I liked 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.010
 enough that it included the truth was not 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.280
 necessary is the morbid that if you 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.520
 remember samus have the ability not 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.730
 I know how your suit has the capacity to 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.180
 become a little ball and then when he is 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.310
 this state can put pumps and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.560
 Well, you can do many things 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.830
 roll I think in the in metroid prime 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.250
 can run at high speeds not 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.980
 I know but I have not played metroid prime but 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.460
 see, my dear friends, what 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.300
 beautiful is that what a beautiful representation 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.850
 of love bold and if you want like that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.280
 to say nothing if samus samu was made 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.800
 pellet 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.310
 can you put him here on the stand 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.210
 to show your morbid and aside 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.210
 we grill if you want 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.680
 we are going to stop here the girl 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.270
 why 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.419
 and there it is 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.500
 the truth is that it 's pretty enough 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.140
 nice and also if you want then 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.110
 this figure brings different options of 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.080
 Hand hands the only hand 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.210
 change is therefore the left hand because 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.330
 in the right hand he has his cannon but 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.680
 we see that he has this one hand with thumb 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.400
 top closed fist this closed fist 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.330
 completely fist so you can 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.520
 take things palm open good palms 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.830
 relaxed and open palms 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.120
 enough options that we have 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.850
 to display 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.639
 and also if we want we can 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.270
 put like the mega man the arts 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:54.210
 brings several shooting effects this from 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.400
 a single shot and this one of two that stops 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.880
 put it simply the only thing we do 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.889
 is 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.610
 remove the tip 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.680
 put 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.900
 this can only enter in such a way 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.360
 that does not have loses and put here the 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.659
 shooting effect for you 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.659
 can 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:20.699
 pretend that we are shooting at 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.740
 serious ridley and prokom yesterday to anyone 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.949
 of your favorite monsters 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.370
 existence I mentioned difficulties of the 8th and 16th 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:33.870
 bits is that the truth is I'm not very adept 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.870
 of the metro its 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.930
 as they are called of the metroid prime but 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.990
 Well, these are the options that you 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.240
 they have this is the single shot 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.630
 here is the one of two unfortunately not 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.950
 bring missiles but that if you yes 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.620
 you know the game they have to 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.450
 look for them for all welfare then not 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.950
 do not worry about them being brought 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.280
 truth is that this is an excellent 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:02.630
 excellent piece I am very very happy 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.630
 with her for a while he had had 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:10.400
 and I was able to buy it in the capital store 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:13.620
 8 at an excellent price and I think it's worth 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.550
 the penalty has many options for 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:22.020
 to exhibit it with enough 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.790
 detail there is a cell link but the 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.790
 truth is that it does not call me much 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.190
 attention we are always 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.060
 I'm going to do a this I do not like 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.440
 cell 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:38.110
 blasphemy I know but the truth is that 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.530
 always if you put me to samus and the 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.900
 link 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:44.530
 I prefer a thousand times we roast to be 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.570
 As a heroine quite so 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.060
 with many balls with many of these 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.010
 but the truth is that it is an excellent 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.860
 excellent figure the link is also seen 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.980
 very very good I say is not about doing what 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.990
 less or nothing that I already did but the 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.419
 truth is that it is very very very good 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.330
 figure if you can get 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:06.790
 these from nintendo these signatures are the 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:11.040
 I highly recommend I am biliary 

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.040
 this is samus aran and we said goodbye
