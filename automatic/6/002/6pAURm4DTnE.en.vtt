 this video is brought to you by 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.510
 experts piloted geopark specialists 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.870
 circuit training courses on 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.430
 france in belgium and germany in 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.410
 through this tutorial we offer 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.490
 to discover or rediscover the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.920
 good basic techniques since 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 of car hostages let's start with a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 90 degree classic turn on the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 everyday road we are 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.750
 required to stay on our path of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.920
 traffic 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.189
 the purpose of this rule of conduct and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 circuit safety objectives 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.460
 are speed and performance 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.399
 three points must be taken into account 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.239
 benchmark to follow the trajectory the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.950
 turning point the rope point and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.540
 the exit point 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.130
 apprehend these good benchmarks allows to 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.080
 form a trajectory with the most 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.700
 large radius of curve possible in the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.560
 purpose of keeping an average speed the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.420
 higher 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.950
 important it is necessary to exploit the whole 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.400
 width of the track to get out at most 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.140
 fast turn 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.120
 to know a trajectory is imperative 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.980
 but it's not the only subtleties of 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.010
 piloting you need to know when 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.990
 curb accelerate the major difference 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.550
 between driving and driving all 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.620
 days is that on track 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.720
 the braking is done exclusively in 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.580
 straight line you have to press hard on the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.650
 brake pedal and do not use the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.130
 engine brake near the point of 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 robbery 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.760
 braking is almost complete 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.190
 the car enters the turn towards 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.170
 the rope point 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.460
 from there you have to prepare for 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.760
 relaunch the acceleration very 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 gradually 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.990
 sÃ¨ye more wheels will be gear 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.600
 the more it will be possible to accelerate hard 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.160
 to roll full throttle you have to wait 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 to have the wheels in the line of the line 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.340
 right 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.520
 let's see a trajectory in a bend 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 tighter lever 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.090
 to catch parables 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.409
 like in a bend and 4 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 Find us 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.340
 of landmarks the turning point the bridge 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.939
 rope 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.939
 the exit point 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.330
 in a tight bend he 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.460
 very late in the curve to stay 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.690
 long outside the bend and then 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.820
 only go to the rope bridge 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.530
 at the rope point the car is 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.360
 almost in the line of the straight line 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.820
 this allows to have the wheels right 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.180
 earlier and therefore to foster recovery 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.180
 gases 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.739
 at the braking 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.050
 pedal always when the wheels are 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.450
 right braking must be decreasing 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.459
 that is to say powerful at the beginning and then 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.030
 less and less strong up to the level of 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.030
 turning point 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.460
 I must wait for the rope point 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.850
 could still accelerate very 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.850
 gradually 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.870
 but having passed the point of 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.870
 exit 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.100
 now let's see the phenomenon of 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.420
 transfer of 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.420
 braking and acceleration 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
 explanations during braking on 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.360
 notes a transfer of charges on the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.360
 train before 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.750
 if the transfer of charges 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.160
 rage the car will go slipping for 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 avoid drifting it is necessary to brake 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.060
 strong before the turn just demoted 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.170
 before the turning point this 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.990
 technique allows to have both hands 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 on the steering wheel from the entrance of the turn to 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.930
 the acceleration the charge transfer is 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.930
 done on the rear axle of the vehicle 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.390
 so long 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.310
 the air before the rope point the train 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.260
 before will be relieved the direction less 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.190
 effective the car will be deported 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.110
 towards the outside of the bend 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.850
 for this reason it is important 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.340
 to be well placed at the point of rope and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.720
 to accelerate progressively as 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.020
 as we put the wheels back in 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.020
 laxe 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.030
 important it takes 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.950
 it's always looking the furthest 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.129
 possible to anticipate the trajectory 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.129
 of the vehicle 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.800
 why should we favor the exit 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.600
 No. 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.190
 we frequently tend to 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.989
 want to go back too early in a bend 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.700
 it is true that it helps to win 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.959
 a few kilometers an hour 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.380
 turn but it's not the right one 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.380
 technical 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.649
 the disadvantage is that the vehicle 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.009
 position it for acceleration 

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:35.659
 at the end of the turn, the recovery of the gases 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.460
 so will be done later and speed 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.599
 lost out of corner of this report 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.599
 all the straight line that follows 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.750
 an ideal trajectory we lose a 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.550
 at its entrance of curve against it 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.350
 will be possible to accelerate sooner and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.820
 the kilometers won right out of 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.740
 turns will be beneficial to speed 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.539
 average throughout the straight line 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.690
 same principle in a sequence of 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.690
 bends 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.199
 we must privilege the exit of the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.759
 in the straight line even though the vehicle 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.090
 loses a bit of speed in input of 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.310
 curve 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.480
 this promotes speed all the way off 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.550
 the straight line 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.140
 to conclude he is a pure 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.670
 time to brake hard in a straight line and 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.370
 to wait for the rope point for 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.540
 relaunch the acceleration smoothly 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.110
 with piloting experience 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.090
 automotive 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 it is possible to perfect this 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.200
 technical improvement in the phase of 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.430
 braking and downshifting to pass 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.500
 from theory to practice 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.980
 find us without delay on 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.980
 the circuits
