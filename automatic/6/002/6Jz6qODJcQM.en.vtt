00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
14 inch and 16 inch but i think my 16

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
14 inch and 16 inch but i think my 16
inch<00:01:01.980> look<00:01:02.460> extra<00:01:03.359> warm-up<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.409> reason

inch look extra warm-up for some reason

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.840 
inch look extra warm-up for some reason
because<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> hair<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.479> past<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.140> bra<00:01:07.350> strap

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850
