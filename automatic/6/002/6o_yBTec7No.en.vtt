00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
think if we could bring ice racing back

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.709 
think if we could bring ice racing back
into<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> into<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> fray<00:00:41.489> somehow<00:00:41.940> whether

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
into the into the fray somehow whether

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
into the into the fray somehow whether
it<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.050> rideau<00:00:43.620> canal<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.610> another

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
it be the rideau canal or or another

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810 
it be the rideau canal or or another
venue<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.950> cool<00:00:47.160> even<00:00:47.700> if

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
venue I think that's really cool even if

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
venue I think that's really cool even if
it's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.120> quarter<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> mile<00:00:48.809> dash<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it's a quarter of a mile dash just to to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's a quarter of a mile dash just to to
see<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> horse<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.840> would

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
see what the horse is how they would

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
see what the horse is how they would
perform<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> ice<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.190> people

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
perform on the ice and get people

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.569 
perform on the ice and get people
involved<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.449> way<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.680> watch<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.520> know

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
involved that way to watch I don't know
how<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> could<00:00:56.940> bring<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> together<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
how you could bring it together but it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
how you could bring it together but it
would<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.590> something<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:59.100> cool<00:00:59.250> I<00:01:00.020> people

don't know how they would do the whole
track<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.580> maybe<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.880> straightaway<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:10.710> race

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
track but maybe a straightaway a race

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
see it like inside like a dome or
something<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.619> great<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:18.060> never

see<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.950> once<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.100> year<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.460> something<00:02:50.580> racing

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
see that once a year or something racing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
see that once a year or something racing
on<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.420> canal<00:02:52.200> or<00:02:52.260> even<00:02:52.680> back<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> Rideau

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
on the canal or even back to the Rideau

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.460 
on the canal or even back to the Rideau
Canal<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.060> think<00:02:54.390> that'd<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.630> fun<00:02:54.810> oish

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530 
Canal just I think that'd be fun oish
racing<00:02:55.830> oh<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.490> kind<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.270> rideau<00:02:57.450> canal

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

racing oh I kind of like to rideau canal
ice<00:02:58.140> racing<00:02:58.590> would<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:59.040> nice<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.820> they<00:02:59.970> brought

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
ice racing would be nice if they brought

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.970 
ice racing would be nice if they brought
that<00:03:00.360> back<00:03:00.620> probably<00:03:01.620> had<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.770> baseball

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that back probably had a baseball

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.000 
that back probably had a baseball
diamonds<00:03:02.490> then<00:03:03.420> wave<00:03:03.690> Park<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.290> Boston<00:03:04.470> I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.340

where the biggest population is and

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.029 
where the biggest population is and

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
where we could have the biggest telecast

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.550 
where we could have the biggest telecast
or<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:53.330> biggest<00:04:53.599> exposure<00:04:53.990> for<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.409> so<00:04:54.530> I

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
or the biggest exposure for it so I

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.290 
or the biggest exposure for it so I
don't<00:04:54.770> really<00:04:54.800> care<00:04:55.069> where<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.610> as<00:04:56.060> long
