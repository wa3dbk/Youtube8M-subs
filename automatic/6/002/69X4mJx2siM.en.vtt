00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that's not even really any excuse but I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.149 
that's not even really any excuse but I
just<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.170> time<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> edit<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.950> like

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
just don't have time to edit that's like

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
just don't have time to edit that's like
the<00:01:17.280> main<00:01:17.460> problem<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> film<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> editing

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the main problem and film that editing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
the main problem and film that editing
takes<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.130> longest<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.680> therefore<00:01:22.680> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
takes the longest so therefore there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.789 
takes the longest so therefore there
have<00:01:23.130> been<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:23.549> videos<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:25.530> my
