00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.670
 good afternoon we are students of the 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.370
 seventh nutrition agriculture 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.679
 semester I educate one my name is miriam 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.860
 martínez hernández and compañeras with 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.890
 empty images we present the subject 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.130
 interaction between drugs and 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 foods 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.349
 the interaction theme your weapon your food 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.840
 It is indeed very important relationship 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.180
 that exist of food consumption and 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
 the intake of medications is so broad 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.649
 as the vast existence of them 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.730
 in the market and food 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.800
 available in addition to being bidirectional 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.260
 therefore the foods of the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.680
 Drugs perform different functions 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.170
 the drugs are chemical substances that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.930
 they will metabolize t in the body 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.180
 all the same systems 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.760
 that the chemical substances contributed 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.130
 for food and food and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.739
 drugs cover different types of 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.770
 needs but can include one 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.850
 over the other decreasing or increasing 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.720
 the effectiveness of a treatment 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.880
 pharmacological a proper diet should 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.880
 accompany any treatment 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.970
 pharmacological to this process what 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.090
 we will know how drug interaction 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.950
 chicken pull interaction food 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.050
 between a simple alteration of the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.060
 medication performance up 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.880
 specific influences on the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.220
 metabolic of parma is known that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.770
 some medications and foods when 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.960
 they are ingested at the same time they can 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.270
 alter the way in which the organism 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.470
 uses or can cause effects 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.200
 collateral many times unwanted the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 interactions between forms and foods 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.630
 can be grouped in three ways 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.090
 first the influence of food 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.270
 in the diet on the drugs that is 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.500
 better known as food interaction 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.290
 medicines 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.690
 the second the influence of drugs 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.630
 of the use of nutrients and 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.810
 Nutritional progressing interaction and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.150
 medicine food the influence of 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 nutritional status about the disposition 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.740
 of the drugs 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.400
 an example of this of these 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.340
 interactions could be antagonism 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.340
 competitive in this case warfarin is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.860
 the anticoagulant whose mode of action is 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.470
 by preventing the conversion of the vitamin 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.650
 k in its formative like vitamins to 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 hypoxia this is indispensable for the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.390
 production of factors 27 9 and 10 in 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.490
 the population letter since the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.430
 green leafy vegetables such as 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.220
 broccoli cabbage spinach cauliflower 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.850
 etcetera are an important source of 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.860
 Vitamin K1 The Vitamin Menadione is due 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.260
 recommend to patients that they do not 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.900
 they consume abundant diets in salads 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.140
 of green leaves and maintain a consumption of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.570
 relatively stable vegetables for not 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.900
 generate impeccable alterations in the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.659
 protein time 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 Some of the most common infractions are 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.950
 following hydroxide to children more 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.840
 hydrates or vitamin t as they act 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.549
 strata significantly increase the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.459
 performance of aluminum at level 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.000
 intestinal and increase their children their 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.769
 plasma levels vitamin t 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.530
 The similar reaction 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.859
 recommendation for extraction is to this 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.400
 tender intake between them two or three 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:43.030
 hours one more interaction are the salts 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.459
 of iron plus strong coffee coffee 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.709
 can contribute to the development of 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.900
 girl but technique in pregnant women 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.170
 and decrease the concentrations of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.290
 iron in newborns this has 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.720
 associated with small cell anemia or by 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.120
 which recommends you avoid consumption 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.239
 of coffee or tea when you have a taurus 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.090
 treatment against iron one more 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.500
 would be lovastatin a fiber or pepín a 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.040
 Fiber and kitchens can run away 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.800
 significantly effectiveness 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.140
 Therapeutics of lovastatin 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.820
 It is recommended that patients 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.150
 undergoing treatment with this 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.340
 drug should not be consumed in excess 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.970
 diets rich in pounds 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.220
 well now you do not need another interaction 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.310
 Very common is the combination of the tour of 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.889
 France with some good medicines 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.650
 because as we know most of the 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.500
 sometimes in grapefruit juice can be part 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.960
 of a healthy diet because it contains 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.960
 Vitamin C and potassium that as soon as possible 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.550
 however grapefruit sometimes not 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.040
 good when it affects the way you 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.620
 medicines act the juice of 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.169
 grapefruit 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.389
 let's cool they can interfere with the 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.669
 action of some medicines the 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.669
 Most drugs interact with 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.010
 the grapefruit tube the juice increases the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.949
 drug function in the blood when 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.380
 there is a configuration is higher than 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.510
 a drug tends to occur in 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.910
 underway are concluded béticos 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.760
 some medications like gelatin in 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.040
 what help lower cholesterol 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:35.620
 they are degraded with the help of an enzyme 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.620
 called cytochrome p450 3 to 4 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.620
 as a subject what action have the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.220
 program to you have to be 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.139
 metabolized in a way that enters in 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.440
 a quantity does not carry in the blood and 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.080
 permanent rather with an organism 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.160
 creating a powerful other medication 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.110
 very common in flour appearance 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.320
 used for the treatment of 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.000
 Allergies are brought to the steel 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.570
 nationalism with the help of protein 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.460
 called carrier action here is to return 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.400
 at zero ounces can block the action of 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.170
 the transporter proteins and 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.360
 decrease the amount of me from 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.570
 medications lost by me about what 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.570
 same 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:32.630
 all in silverware and not the most 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:36.200
 dairy products and derivatives 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:43.560
 decrease to the availability of 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:45.300
 cucumbers and neighbors but good here is not 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.730
 they must administer dairy products 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.290
 during the two hours after the 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.290
 medical administrations 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.479
 ah
