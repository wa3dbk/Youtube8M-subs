for<00:00:44.340> example<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> 300<00:00:46.200> gallon<00:00:46.289> hot<00:00:46.620> tub

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
for example I have a 300 gallon hot tub

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
for example I have a 300 gallon hot tub
I've<00:00:47.430> tested<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> pH<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> water<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.170> I've

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I've tested the pH of the water and I've

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
I've tested the pH of the water and I've
got<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> reading<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.250> seven<00:00:50.550> point<00:00:50.760> eight<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.660> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
got a reading of seven point eight so I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
got a reading of seven point eight so I
need<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> reduce<00:00:52.379> my<00:00:52.590> pH<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.160> seven<00:00:53.489> point

our<00:01:37.740> second<00:01:38.159> example<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.960> hot

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
our second example is we now have a hot

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.490 
our second example is we now have a hot
tub<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.710> 400<00:01:41.400> gallons<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.790> water<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.500> after

tub with 400 gallons of water and after
the<00:01:43.619> pH<00:01:44.009> test<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.030> established<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.689> pH

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the pH test we have established the pH

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
the pH test we have established the pH
reading<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.560> seven<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> fact<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> pH

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
reading is seven so in fact the pH

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.270 
reading is seven so in fact the pH
reading<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> low<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.710> we're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
reading is low so we're going to have to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.819 
reading is low so we're going to have to
use<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.670> pH<00:01:50.970> increase<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> spa<00:01:52.530> care

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
use the pH increase from the spa care

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.929 
use the pH increase from the spa care
kit<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.520> raise<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> pH<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.329> your<00:01:54.689> spa<00:01:54.960> water<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
kit to raise the pH of your spa water I

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.109 
kit to raise the pH of your spa water I
said<00:01:56.939> again<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> same<00:01:57.689> principle<00:01:58.229> applies<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
said again the same principle applies a

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
said again the same principle applies a
teaspoon<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.360> pH<00:02:00.960> increase<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:02.100> increase

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
teaspoon of pH increase will increase

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.649 
teaspoon of pH increase will increase
your<00:02:02.670> pH<00:02:03.119> by<00:02:03.420> 0.2<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> 400

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
your pH by 0.2 so because we have a 400

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.949 
your pH by 0.2 so because we have a 400
gallon<00:02:06.960> hot<00:02:07.530> tub<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.330> four

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959

gallon hot tub we have to use four
teaspoons<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:11.009> pH<00:02:11.790> increase<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
teaspoons of pH increase to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.050 
teaspoons of pH increase to
raise<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:14.140> pH<00:02:14.470> from<00:02:14.740> seven<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.280> seven<00:02:15.850> point

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
raise the pH from seven to seven point

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.570 
raise the pH from seven to seven point
to<00:02:16.500> adding<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> product<00:02:17.980> directly<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.460> the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
to adding the product directly to the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.150 
to adding the product directly to the
filter<00:02:18.910> compartment<00:02:19.540> with<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.590> hot<00:02:20.920> tub

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
filter compartment with the hot tub

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.140 
filter compartment with the hot tub
water<00:02:21.700> running<00:02:22.290> wait<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.560> ten<00:02:23.740> minutes<00:02:24.150> then

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
water running wait for ten minutes then

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.020 
water running wait for ten minutes then
add<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.500> second<00:02:26.500> application<00:02:26.710> of<00:02:27.520> four

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
add the second application of four

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.230 
add the second application of four
teaspoons<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.840> pH<00:02:29.290> increase<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.640> raise<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.090> pH

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
teaspoons of pH increase to raise the pH

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.210 
teaspoons of pH increase to raise the pH
from<00:02:31.600> 7.2<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.850> 7.4<00:02:34.080> finally<00:02:35.080> retest<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.010> water

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
from 7.2 to 7.4 finally retest the water

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.100 
from 7.2 to 7.4 finally retest the water
and<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.180> should<00:02:37.210> have<00:02:37.570> achieved<00:02:37.990> your

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
and you should have achieved your

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.000 
and you should have achieved your
desired<00:02:38.350> reading<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.130> 7.4
