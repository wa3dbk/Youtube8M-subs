00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.460 
there is a nice Stephane Grappelli lick
which<00:00:02.129> works<00:00:02.370> very<00:00:02.490> well<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.449> minor<00:00:03.750> with<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
which works very well on a minor with a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.440 
which works very well on a minor with a
flat<00:00:04.799> fifth<00:00:05.430> note<00:00:09.920> that's<00:00:10.920> an<00:00:11.070> upbeat<00:00:11.450> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
flat fifth note that's an upbeat and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.170 
flat fifth note that's an upbeat and
then<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.320> beat<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:15.650> not<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.830> playing<00:00:17.180> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
then on the beat so not just playing the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.790 
then on the beat so not just playing the
E<00:00:18.210> flat<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:18.900> we're<00:00:19.020> even<00:00:19.050> playing<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
E flat but we're even playing it with a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.109 
E flat but we're even playing it with a
slide<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.279> certain<00:00:23.580> type<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> slide

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
slide and it's a certain type of slide

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
slide and it's a certain type of slide
that<00:00:24.300> goes<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.109> down<00:00:25.170> again<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
that goes up and then down again which I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
that goes up and then down again which I
call<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.430> push<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.119> pull<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:33.140> we

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
call a push and a pull so we do and we

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.060 
call a push and a pull so we do and we
can<00:00:34.320> add<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.770> thing<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:40.070> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
can add a little thing at the end so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.560 
can add a little thing at the end so
this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> nice<00:00:41.520> lick<00:00:41.879> let's<00:00:42.210> look<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this is a nice lick let's look at the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.810 
this is a nice lick let's look at the
lick<00:00:42.719> more<00:00:42.870> closely<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.710> maybe<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.489> lean

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
lick more closely and then maybe a lean

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
lick more closely and then maybe a lean
would<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> play<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.170> mine<00:00:50.329> that's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
would like to play it on a mine that's

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
would like to play it on a mine that's
an<00:00:51.480> E<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.309> C<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
an E and a of C and then there is a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.590 
an E and a of C and then there is a
third<00:00:55.410> finger<00:00:55.710> playing<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> D<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> E<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.600> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
third finger playing the D the E and the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.250 
third finger playing the D the E and the
D<00:01:00.629> again<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.100> bow<00:01:03.260> just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
blue note and that's the E flat on the D

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.960 
blue note and that's the E flat on the D
string<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> first<00:01:22.560> finger<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.189> low<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
string that's the first finger a low a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.060 
string that's the first finger a low a
flattened<00:01:24.479> first<00:01:24.960> finger<00:01:25.460> D<00:01:26.460> C<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.380> here's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
flattened first finger D C and a here's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.060 
flattened first finger D C and a here's
the<00:01:29.220> lick<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:29.549> again

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.230

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
aleem would you like to try it now on a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.970 
aleem would you like to try it now on a
minor<00:01:37.820> one

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.010 

that's<00:01:45.980> great<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.730> can<00:01:46.880> exaggerate<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.840> push

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
that's great you can exaggerate the push

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.500 
that's great you can exaggerate the push
in<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.290> pool<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.800> third<00:01:49.310> finger<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:53.360> make

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
in the pool of the third finger to make

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.880 
in the pool of the third finger to make
it<00:01:53.660> sound<00:01:53.840> more<00:01:54.580> blue<00:01:56.560> let's<00:01:57.560> try<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.800> again

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it sound more blue let's try it again

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.140 
it sound more blue let's try it again
one<00:01:58.520> two<00:01:59.000> three<00:01:59.570> four

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150
