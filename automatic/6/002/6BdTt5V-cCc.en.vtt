00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.360 
getting something that's a little bit
quieter<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.470> know<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> couple<00:02:12.890> bells<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
quieter you know a couple bells and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.880 
quieter you know a couple bells and
whistles<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:13.730> not<00:02:14.210> all<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.450> much<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:15.710> what's

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
whistles but not all that much so what's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.410 
whistles but not all that much so what's
really<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.250> want<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.580> focus<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.030> breaking<00:02:17.390> down

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
really I want to focus on breaking down

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.420 
really I want to focus on breaking down
the<00:02:17.630> seven<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> nine<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:19.280> that's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the seven to the nine because that's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.970 
the seven to the nine because that's
where<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> axe<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.450> seven<00:02:20.870> ready<00:02:21.080> comes<00:02:21.830> in

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
where the axe the seven ready comes in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.830 
where the axe the seven ready comes in
at<00:02:22.070> forty<00:02:22.370> two<00:02:22.490> decibels<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.360> as<00:02:23.450> far<00:02:23.630> as<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
at forty two decibels and as far as the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.970 
at forty two decibels and as far as the
energy<00:02:24.050> consumption<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:26.200> think<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.830> it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
energy consumption I think I think it's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.070 
energy consumption I think I think it's
a<00:02:28.040> bad<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.400> 250<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.240> not<00:02:29.360> mistaken<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.990> if

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
a bad like 250 I'm not mistaken and if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.390 
a bad like 250 I'm not mistaken and if
I'm<00:02:30.200> wrong<00:02:30.380> you're<00:02:30.620> gonna<00:02:30.740> see<00:02:31.010> something's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400

dishwasher available in the States

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.880 
dishwasher available in the States
so<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:50.150> from<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.420> forty<00:02:50.780> two<00:02:50.960> in<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> seven

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so going from a forty two in the seven

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.040 
so going from a forty two in the seven
to<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.069> thirty<00:02:52.370> nine<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.910> nine<00:02:52.940> from<00:02:53.840> what

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
to a thirty nine and a nine from what

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.470 
to a thirty nine and a nine from what
some<00:02:54.950> audio<00:02:55.580> engineers<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.060> told<00:02:56.270> me<00:02:56.360> it's

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
some audio engineers have told me it's

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.059 
some audio engineers have told me it's
basically<00:02:56.870> doubling<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.620> noise<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
basically doubling the noise in the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.559 
basically doubling the noise in the
dishwasher<00:02:58.670> when<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.850> start<00:02:59.060> going<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.420> by<00:02:59.540> a

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
dishwasher when you start going up by a

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.990 
dishwasher when you start going up by a
decibel<00:02:59.930> or<00:03:00.140> two<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:01.130> there's<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.640> difference

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
decibel or two so there's a difference

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.230 
decibel or two so there's a difference
there<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.330> sound<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:03.560> nine<00:03:03.770> also<00:03:04.240> uses

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
there and sound the nine also uses

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.480 
there and sound the nine also uses
barely<00:03:05.540> over<00:03:05.840> 200<00:03:06.320> kilowatts<00:03:06.560> per<00:03:06.830> year<00:03:07.160> so

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
barely over 200 kilowatts per year so

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.240 
barely over 200 kilowatts per year so
that<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.180> definitely<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.630> most<00:03:08.720> energy

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
that is definitely the most energy

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.810 
that is definitely the most energy
dishwasher<00:03:10.060> available<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.950> nine<00:03:12.130> also<00:03:12.700> has

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
dishwasher available the nine also has

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.720 
dishwasher available the nine also has
one<00:03:13.060> more<00:03:13.240> wah<00:03:13.510> cycle<00:03:13.990> than<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> seven<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
one more wah cycle than the seven so I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.880 
one more wah cycle than the seven so I
believe<00:03:16.360> that<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.810> actually<00:03:17.230> no<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.380> know<00:03:17.530> it's

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
believe that is actually no I know it's

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.680 
believe that is actually no I know it's
a<00:03:18.100> glass<00:03:18.460> care<00:03:18.880> cycle<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.480> if<00:03:19.570> you're
