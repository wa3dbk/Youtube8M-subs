00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 they give you these games to you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.770
 not only because of the football reminded 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.990
 the last with the Bavarian leverkusen too 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.869
 Gast in sinsheim was one of 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.599
 this variety is exactly exactly 14 months 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 then it comes to a new edition for me 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.740
 has done that with the phantom gate 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 Well, that's when we were based 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 ticked 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 a piece of bundesliga history is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 still not relevant for this 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.820
 encounter and still somehow 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.650
 currently only five days after 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 home win against Eintracht Frankfurt so 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.309
 the next part at home to guest this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.320
 times the table third building is now 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 with leverkusen could be extremely heavy 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
 One has already seen opponents of us 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.770
 yesterday what the first half 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 have organized with gladbach 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.579
 I think if we are out of the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 Coming out are also relative 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 open back that's what I believe ours 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.009
 chance but as I said leverkusen very much 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.509
 difficult opponents to play and but 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.520
 I believe if we implement what the 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.950
 Coach then lays us down 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 we also got three points because of that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.819
 Coach is so at hand is at home 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.530
 yamaha is especially good at three of them 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.509
 won last four home games 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.599
 this time the guests are strong 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.069
 similarity with the tsg at least what 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:30.390
 the ways of playing 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:33.959
 both teams have their own 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.550
 Qualities in dressing good 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.860
 It can also be against it 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.580
 already pressing- oriented wild 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 Game will be from both teams and then 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.550
 you have to try to prevail 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.440
 So I believe that hope home 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.149
 you have both great strengths 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.920
 but must take into account just stop and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.229
 here, too, of course, and we know it too 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 that we also share our content with each other 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.160
 we can hurt our opponents 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.420
 chances to win on Wednesday against 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.700
 hoffenheim and then it is easy to 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.220
 we always have something in total 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720
 To hear more efficient would be the tsg against 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.360
 frankfurt sees plays leverkusen 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.819
 draw against gladbach maybe 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 that was a very good preparation 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.920
 on the penultimate game of the year 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.080
 take up 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.489
 similar plants as borussia 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 mÃ¶nchengladbach also very good at 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.800
 switch to ball gain and therefore 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.130
 maybe this will be a similar game 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.310
 we just have to be very focused 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.690
 prepare for it the moments 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.370
 Yesterday where just after the gate 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.900
 Dangerous is good on the account 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.489
 even analyze for that another 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.410
 do even better and then I am 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.319
 convinced that we at one 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.060
 namely similar case closed 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.099
 always able to occur are also in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.920
 to win hopeheim who stands above 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.230
 May not be self-confident any 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.470
 question of the final lap could be for 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.569
 become real pressing firm 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.299
 it makes it extremely possible we think 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.299
 times also has extreme and therefore 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:15.890
 a lot of character 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 strong back and forth strong 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.270
 pronounced situations between the 16 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.459
 meters clear the games decide 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.900
 which balls are won there and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.500
 then would be a good game continuation 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.390
 out of these positions has become both 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.090
 teams knit quite similar 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.890
 a lot comes together the last 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.019
 home game of the year with a 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 special historical prehistory 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.670
 against an opponent of oneself 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.670
 not dissimilar is what you want more
