of<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> yeah<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
of them I think so yeah that was a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080 
of them I think so yeah that was a
pretty<00:01:45.240> good<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.520> needed<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> card

certificate<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.630> horntail<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
certificate for horntail to get the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.179 
certificate for horntail to get the
horntail<00:01:53.070> squad<00:01:53.310> badge<00:01:54.409> but<00:01:55.409> I'll<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:56.040> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
horntail squad badge but I'll get that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.700 
horntail squad badge but I'll get that
on<00:01:56.340> done<00:01:56.579> eventually<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.750> sure

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
on done eventually I'm sure

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.490 
on done eventually I'm sure
and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.070> figured<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.790> I'd<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.240> Zakim<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.320> well

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and I figured that I'd go Zakim as well

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.300 
and I figured that I'd go Zakim as well
because<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.549> am<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.330> did<00:02:03.720> one<00:02:03.869> before<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.920> remap

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
because I am I did one before the remap

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.139 
because I am I did one before the remap
and<00:02:05.549> now<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.750> after<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:09.000> might

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and now you know this is after you might

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080 
and now you know this is after you might
be<00:02:09.300> wondering<00:02:09.560> why<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> don't<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.490> any<00:02:11.670> robots

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.920 
anything like that largely just because
it<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.950> still<00:02:26.220> disconnecting<00:02:26.850> me<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.239> didn't

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
it it's still disconnecting me I didn't

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.750 
it it's still disconnecting me I didn't
try<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.170> while<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.440> was<00:02:28.560> training<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
try it while I was training because I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
try it while I was training because I
didn't<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:30.870> think<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.320> worth<00:02:31.620> testing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
didn't really think it was worth testing

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.640 
didn't really think it was worth testing
out<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.330> know<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> find<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.380> issue

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
out you know to find that it's an issue

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.280 
out you know to find that it's an issue
and<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:35.340> it'll<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.600> rot<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.870> training

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and then it'll just just rot my training

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.920 
and then it'll just just rot my training
so<00:02:37.500> i<00:02:37.550> didn't<00:02:38.550> i<00:02:38.760> didn't<00:02:39.239> use<00:02:39.360> anything<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.840> all

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
so i didn't i didn't use anything at all

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.949 
so i didn't i didn't use anything at all
for<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> last<00:02:41.100> couple<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.670> days<00:02:41.850> since<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
for the last couple of days since the

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.930 
for the last couple of days since the
revamp<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.310> training<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:46.940> after

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
revamp that I was here training so after

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.570 
revamp that I was here training so after
i<00:02:48.000> got<00:02:48.120> 200<00:02:48.330> i<00:02:48.690> decided<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.320> give<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.890> try<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
i got 200 i decided to give it a try you

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.940 
i got 200 i decided to give it a try you
know<00:02:50.700> son<00:02:51.239> like<00:02:51.540> summon<00:02:51.989> bots<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.350> tights<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950

know son like summon bots and tights and
amp<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.030> see<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.570> those<00:02:55.140> two<00:02:55.590> would

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
amp and see if those two would

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.710 
amp and see if those two would
disconnect<00:02:56.489> me<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.790> all<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.269> know<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.540> feel

something<00:02:57.780> else<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.350> i<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.530> using<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.069> i

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
something else that i was using and i

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.590 
something else that i was using and i
was<00:03:00.209> filming<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.810> seasick<00:03:01.200> video<00:03:01.440> at<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.860> time

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
was filming a seasick video at the time

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.380 
was filming a seasick video at the time
to<00:03:03.680> put<00:03:04.680> into<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.950> different<00:03:05.640> video<00:03:05.730> from<00:03:06.180> this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to put into a different video from this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.870 
to put into a different video from this
it<00:03:06.750> wasn't<00:03:06.959> gonna<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.320> same<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.650> but<00:03:08.489> i

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
it wasn't gonna be in the same one but i

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.210 
it wasn't gonna be in the same one but i
put<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.450> there<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.640> well<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.670> put<00:03:12.450> them<00:03:12.630> out

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
put it in there and well I put them out

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.759 
put it in there and well I put them out
when<00:03:14.220> i<00:03:14.250> was<00:03:14.459> doing<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:14.940> Zach<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.420> got<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
when i was doing see Zach I got up to I

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.590 
when i was doing see Zach I got up to I
think<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.280> probably<00:03:17.519> halfway<00:03:18.299> through

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
think it was probably halfway through

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.830 
think it was probably halfway through
second<00:03:18.989> body<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.709> disconnected<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.239> I'm

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
second body and I disconnected so I'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.569 
second body and I disconnected so I'm
not<00:03:22.049> sure<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:22.920> issue<00:03:23.100> just

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
not sure if it's an issue just

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.259 
not sure if it's an issue just
specifically<00:03:24.239> with<00:03:24.480> me<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.900> haven't<00:03:25.380> seen<00:03:26.269> well

I haven't really found out whether it's
a<00:03:46.530> overall<00:03:47.100> issue<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.609> everyone<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.970> having

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
a overall issue that everyone is having

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.099 
a overall issue that everyone is having
or<00:03:48.510> if<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.170> me<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:50.370> really<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.750> damage

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
or if it's just me but really the damage

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.320 
or if it's just me but really the damage
that<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.320> putting<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.709> is

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
that I'm putting out is

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.140 
that I'm putting out is
you<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.690> oh<00:03:55.070> hi<00:03:56.070> ah<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:59.370> compensate<00:03:59.610> for

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
you know oh hi ah so to compensate for

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.590 
you know oh hi ah so to compensate for
not<00:04:00.180> having<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.070> yeah<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.090> um

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
not having that so I yeah I just um

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.670 
not having that so I yeah I just um
decided<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.320> go<00:04:07.470> without<00:04:07.710> it<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:09.050> yeah<00:04:10.050> it's

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
decided to go without it and yeah it's

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.270 
decided to go without it and yeah it's
still<00:04:10.950> right<00:04:11.190> without<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:12.860> it's<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> bit<00:04:14.100> slow

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
still right without it it's a bit slow

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.229 
still right without it it's a bit slow
but<00:04:15.260> really<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.410> could<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:17.459> used<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.850> for<00:04:18.060> Zach

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
but really I could have used it for Zach

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.030 
but really I could have used it for Zach
because<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.870> would<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.260> been<00:04:19.440> done<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.890> by

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
because I would have been done that by

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.480 
because I would have been done that by
the<00:04:20.100> time<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:21.390> would<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.750> deceived<00:04:22.140> me<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.530> was

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the time it would have deceived me I was

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.680 
the time it would have deceived me I was
in<00:04:23.670> the<00:04:24.480> chaos<00:04:24.810> sack<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:26.550> think<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.510> was

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
in the chaos sack for I think it was

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.950 
in the chaos sack for I think it was
barely<00:04:27.900> even<00:04:28.020> 10<00:04:28.350> minutes<00:04:28.380> yeah<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.960> just

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
barely even 10 minutes yeah and I just

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.550 
barely even 10 minutes yeah and I just
disconnected<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.850> yeah<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.540> was<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.690> bit<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.440> a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
disconnected so yeah it was a bit of a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.760 
disconnected so yeah it was a bit of a
shame<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:35.580> yeah<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.880> really<00:04:36.560> can't<00:04:37.560> do

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
shame but yeah you really can't do

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.320 
shame but yeah you really can't do
anything<00:04:37.800> about<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.340> also<00:04:38.730> been<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.090> neither

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
anything about it also been that neither

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.030 
anything about it also been that neither
just<00:04:39.690> fixed<00:04:40.020> itself<00:04:40.290> when<00:04:40.590> they<00:04:40.710> revamped

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
just fixed itself when they revamped

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.830 
just fixed itself when they revamped
hopefully<00:04:41.610> nexon<00:04:41.970> was<00:04:42.120> gonna<00:04:42.330> copy<00:04:42.600> all<00:04:42.810> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
hopefully nexon was gonna copy all the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.310 
hopefully nexon was gonna copy all the
you<00:04:43.260> know<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:44.160> phone<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.820> data<00:04:44.910> from<00:04:45.810> KMS

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
you know in phone and data from KMS

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.090 
you know in phone and data from KMS
straight<00:04:46.890> into<00:04:47.160> GMS<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.300> would<00:04:49.100> solve

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
straight into GMS and it would solve

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.310 
straight into GMS and it would solve
itself<00:04:50.460> because<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.110> sometimes<00:04:52.110> happens

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
itself because that sometimes happens

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.140 
itself because that sometimes happens
like<00:04:52.830> they<00:04:53.010> don't<00:04:53.340> really<00:04:53.610> notice<00:04:53.790> it<00:04:53.970> but

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
like they don't really notice it but

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.490 
like they don't really notice it but
they<00:04:54.300> accidentally<00:04:54.750> fix<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.080> all<00:04:55.200> they<00:04:55.320> keep

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
they accidentally fix it all they keep

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.080 
they accidentally fix it all they keep
copying<00:04:55.860> pasting<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.370> hoping<00:04:56.700> that<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.000> will

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
copying pasting it hoping that it will

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.500 
copying pasting it hoping that it will
fix<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.680> doesn't<00:04:58.710> come<00:04:59.100> out<00:04:59.130> as<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.510> known

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
fix it so it doesn't come out as a known

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.840 
fix it so it doesn't come out as a known
glitch<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:01.650> i<00:05:01.950> don't<00:05:02.160> know<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.370> might<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.669> be

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
glitch so i don't know it might just be

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.890 
glitch so i don't know it might just be
me<00:05:02.880> if<00:05:03.390> it<00:05:03.660> continues<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.940> do<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.570> you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
me if it continues to do this and you

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.690 
me if it continues to do this and you
know<00:05:07.020> i<00:05:07.050> find<00:05:07.350> i<00:05:07.530> can't<00:05:07.560> do<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.340> bosses

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700

putting<00:05:19.080> out<00:05:19.260> enough<00:05:19.440> damage<00:05:20.780> I'll<00:05:21.780> probably

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
putting out enough damage I'll probably

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.890 
putting out enough damage I'll probably
move<00:05:22.890> back<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.280> my<00:05:23.370> jet<00:05:23.640> until<00:05:24.419> angelic

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.310 
burster comes out and then I'll work out
what<00:05:26.400> I'll<00:05:26.520> do<00:05:26.669> from<00:05:26.970> there<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:27.990> really<00:05:28.290> I

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320
