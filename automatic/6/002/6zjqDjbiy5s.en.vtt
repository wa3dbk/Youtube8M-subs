half circle around it the singer on the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.080 
half circle around it the singer on the
wrist<00:02:31.270> same<00:02:32.270> thing<00:02:32.569> down<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.430> we'll<00:02:34.430> just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
wrist same thing down there we'll just

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
it goes in like that so it's kind of

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.470 
it goes in like that so it's kind of
weird<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.530> there's<00:03:57.519> this<00:03:57.639> extra<00:03:57.939> joint<00:03:58.239> down

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480

here stuck the waste that moves freely
which<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.919> kind<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:04.799> kind<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.919> weird<00:04:06.159> but<00:04:06.280> cool

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
which is kind of kind of weird but cool

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
another hand which is actually kind of

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.030

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
it also comes with this shield which

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.160 
it also comes with this shield which
just<00:04:35.680> fits<00:04:36.010> into<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.400> hand<00:04:36.690> like<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.750> and

then clips on and then a beam sword
which<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.170> actually<00:04:44.350> this<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.520> really<00:04:46.030> neat

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
which is actually this is a really neat

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.680 
which is actually this is a really neat
figure<00:04:47.350> because<00:04:47.680> it's<00:04:47.830> more<00:04:48.010> like<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> night

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
figure because it's more like a night

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.040 
figure because it's more like a night
but<00:04:49.690> also<00:04:49.840> what<00:04:50.140> they<00:04:50.290> did<00:04:50.470> do<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:51.600> since<00:04:52.600> there

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
but also what they did do is since there

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
but also what they did do is since there
are<00:04:53.260> little<00:04:53.560> missiles<00:04:54.040> in<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:55.440> all<00:04:56.440> that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
are little missiles in that all that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.190 
are little missiles in that all that
they<00:04:57.610> put<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.850> little<00:04:58.000> extra<00:04:58.270> joint<00:04:58.600> where<00:04:59.110> it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
they put a little extra joint where it

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.160 
they put a little extra joint where it
comes<00:04:59.350> around<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.770> over<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.460> fist<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.870> I

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
comes around and over the fist so I

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:09.870 
comes around and over the fist so I
thought<00:05:02.350> that's<00:05:02.500> pretty<00:05:02.830> neat<00:05:07.080> also<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:09.670> comes

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
thought that's pretty neat also it comes

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.230 
thought that's pretty neat also it comes
with<00:05:10.770> these<00:05:11.770> little<00:05:12.310> things<00:05:12.340> which<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:12.940> think's

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
with these little things which I think's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.470 
with these little things which I think's
are<00:05:13.390> which<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:13.840> think<00:05:14.170> our<00:05:14.320> minds<00:05:14.890> that<00:05:15.100> uh

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
are which I think our minds that uh

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.330 
are which I think our minds that uh
should<00:05:16.480> add<00:05:16.660> those<00:05:16.900> holes<00:05:17.230> i<00:05:17.560> think<00:05:17.830> i'm<00:05:18.100> not

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
should add those holes i think i'm not

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.640 
should add those holes i think i'm not
