00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.540
 I present to you a model of elderberry or triumph 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.020
 10 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.559
 it's new from the first primary summer and 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.870
 I will try to explain it teaches me 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.710
 near 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.289
 model 3 a day 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.439
 before we said more closely and see how 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.329
 complete and I do not like to tell you that 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.529
 this shoe that brings us to the time 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.539
 of training 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.720
 I would say that those shoes that are 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.060
 sneaker for long workouts 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.420
 well for elite people to 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.300
 people who start running the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.140
 sneaker for 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 to walk 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.760
 What sets us apart is a day of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.739
 the others more slippers first his 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.969
 weight you already know that a sneaker 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 training on whether he offered 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.790
 heavy 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.790
 it is nothing that super light 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.379
 let's not say despite but flag for the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.379
 280 grams 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 although it came to weigh more than one 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.860
 normal the feeling when running 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.620
 it's tools 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.730
 very good energy 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.140
 at the time of running those 15 pills and 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.780
 slippers that give a feeling that 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.640
 muffles a lot but but then they are 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 very slow when transmitting 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.730
 sensations that shoe transmits us 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.440
 sensation 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.890
 very 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.340
 very fast very stable which is the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 neutral zapateado 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.780
 you know what a pretty neutral difference 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.159
 we know that the left side of 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.579
 Sneaker is like the right one and we 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.579
 we try 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.200
 but 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.810
 the feeling or motivation of the side 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.830
 left is equal the right in a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.830
 provider inside would be much more 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 hard 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.879
 the concept is very minimalist since we 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.980
 we remove those from the leather folds 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.500
 or skin that put two votes 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.660
 manufacturers 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.870
 and what is a sneaker you give from where 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.670
 and how minimalist but remember 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.680
 established training rooms 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.099
 between nothing 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.459
 run a marathon etc. species to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.459
 zavalÃ­a 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.000
 well here they have the shoe of a 10 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.990
 you can see 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.520
 the complete minimalism that the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.800
 shoe 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.310
 you can see you can appreciate normally 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.620
 that all sneakers 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:55.250
 is printed is with pieces of skin for 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 reinforce out here luck other 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.940
 marks the same then cross it over here 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.310
 or it here so that no more 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.459
 stable one thing is to be stable from 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.940
 of sole and those things that is stable from 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.110
 form is worth that is the way 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.810
 if you realize inside 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 this sneaker between a day is by 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.390
 inside what are the reinforcements of the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.390
 instep 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.470
 the laces are flat cuts is not 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.390
 It is necessary to double cord so that 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.970
 let go and that assures us a good 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 squeeze in 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.290
 and the holes for the tensioning can 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.110
 appreciate the heel the reinforcement is 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.319
 important to emphasize that in that shoe 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.349
 will never break here 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.069
 you know that it did not happen to me 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.099
 that the part of the heel is skinned is 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.730
 it was a hole that produced a 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.879
 rubbing this is usually due to a bad to 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.209
 a bad design or a bad manufacturing 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.600
 seriously have networks solved at 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.720
 system 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.850
 sap fit that is simply because 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.640
 we think of the rope 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.070
 in let's say the coupling to instep is 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.390
 perfect and so we get that 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.450
 I have to be in warm maquilas 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.600
 we do not move 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.710
 What else brings us one day apart from 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.900
 minimalism no friction 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.190
 of uncomfortable frictions because that lightness and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.890
 8 mm 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.920
 and those are the famous eight millimeters 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.990
 that the question is simply that the 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.840
 difference between the heel 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.540
 and I'm going to cases if we mark a line 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.960
 straight 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.070
 they are 8 millimeters we get to run more 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.240
 flat 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.690
 a lower weight greater taxes 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 then we have the sole system of the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.220
 power beap paul berriff is a system 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.200
 that is music is a crossbow that 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.660
 helps to push forward 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.600
 the truth that it is a sneaker 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:22.050
 awesome and I hope you can 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:26.569
 enjoy a super green color 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.569
 to do kilometers and kilometers
