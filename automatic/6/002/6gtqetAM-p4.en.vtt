and<00:01:54.730> that's<00:01:54.880> what<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.060> used<00:01:57.120> is<00:01:58.120> when<00:01:58.270> I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and that's what I used is when I

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.770 
and that's what I used is when I
installed<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:59.100> originally<00:02:00.480> just<00:02:01.480> kind<00:02:01.660> of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
installed it originally just kind of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
installed it originally just kind of
fixing<00:02:02.500> it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
fixing it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.320 
fixing it
seeing<00:02:03.640> where<00:02:03.820> I'd<00:02:03.940> end<00:02:04.180> up<00:02:04.479> putting<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.930> I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
seeing where I'd end up putting it I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.840 
seeing where I'd end up putting it I
have<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.390> brake<00:02:07.690> line<00:02:07.930> right<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.550> very

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
have a brake line right there so I very

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.330 
have a brake line right there so I very
simply<00:02:10.450> marked<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.560> grind<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.010> out<00:02:15.100> where

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
simply marked it and grind it out where

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
simply marked it and grind it out where
I<00:02:15.370> needed<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.440> end<00:02:17.880> sits<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:22.030> blinker

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
I needed the end sits on the blinker

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
I needed the end sits on the blinker
indicators<00:02:24.959> inside<00:02:25.959> here<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> strip<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
indicators inside here is a strip of the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.570 
indicators inside here is a strip of the
fastener<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.290> see<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:34.209> on<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:34.660> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
fastener as you can see it's on there I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.530 
fastener as you can see it's on there I
went<00:02:36.580> for<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> ride<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.239> don't<00:02:37.360> know<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
went for a ride and I don't know if you

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.080 
went for a ride and I don't know if you
can<00:02:37.690> see<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:38.320> there's<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.489> remains<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.030> a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
can see it but there's the remains of a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.470 
can see it but there's the remains of a
bug

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.470 

so<00:02:47.480> looks<00:02:48.319> pretty<00:02:48.560> good<00:02:49.840> really<00:02:50.840> doesn't

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
so looks pretty good really doesn't

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.270 
so looks pretty good really doesn't
intrude<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:53.720> vision<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:54.560> gets<00:02:54.800> really

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
intrude your vision that gets really

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.390 
intrude your vision that gets really
clear<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.930> improves<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.560> ride<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.769> lot<00:02:58.160> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
clear it improves the ride a lot I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.820 
clear it improves the ride a lot I
noticed<00:02:58.879> that<00:02:59.090> when<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.720> sat<00:03:00.080> down<00:03:00.110> on<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.610> bike

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
noticed that when I sat down on the bike

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.520 
noticed that when I sat down on the bike
that<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.700> wind<00:03:04.970> hit<00:03:05.720> me<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.050> helmet

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that the wind hit me in the helmet

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.790 
that the wind hit me in the helmet
rather<00:03:07.370> than<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.670> chest

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
rather than the chest

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.789 
rather than the chest
so<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.860> kind<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.069> went<00:03:10.220> up<00:03:10.310> over<00:03:14.349> I'm<00:03:15.349> sitting

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
so it kind of went up over I'm sitting

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.190 
so it kind of went up over I'm sitting
on<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> bike<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.870> see<00:03:18.049> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
on the bike now and you can see the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.910 
on the bike now and you can see the
difference<00:03:18.590> here<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:20.599> here<00:03:20.840> now<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.860> is

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
difference here to here now it is

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.900 
difference here to here now it is
tapered<00:03:23.500> I'm<00:03:24.500> not<00:03:24.680> sure<00:03:24.950> if<00:03:25.099> I<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.670> taper

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
tapered I'm not sure if I like the taper

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.300 
tapered I'm not sure if I like the taper
it<00:03:26.599> looks<00:03:27.349> good<00:03:27.590> but<00:03:28.430> I'm<00:03:28.579> wondering<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:29.209> a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
it looks good but I'm wondering what a

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.449 
it looks good but I'm wondering what a
flat<00:03:34.090> face<00:03:35.090> shield<00:03:35.390> would<00:03:35.660> do<00:03:36.340> let's<00:03:37.340> see

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
flat face shield would do let's see

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.670 
flat face shield would do let's see
that's<00:03:37.640> really<00:03:37.819> simple<00:03:38.120> because<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.319> ten

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
that's really simple because for ten

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.970 
that's really simple because for ten
bucks<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.280> could<00:03:40.790> get<00:03:40.970> one<00:03:41.620> get<00:03:42.620> some<00:03:42.829> more

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
bucks I could get one get some more

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.630 
bucks I could get one get some more
