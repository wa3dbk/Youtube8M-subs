the sails fluttering you're in a slow
condition<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> tension<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
condition so you take the tension on the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.310 
condition so you take the tension on the
leech<00:00:53.399> before<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.539> stop<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> flutter

sock everything is under control

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700 
sock everything is under control
now<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.880> simply<00:01:33.299> raise<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> soccer<00:01:33.990> sleeve<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
now we simply raise the soccer sleeve to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.980 
now we simply raise the soccer sleeve to
let<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> spinnaker<00:01:35.369> set<00:01:35.759> watch<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.750> easy

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
let the spinnaker set watch how easy

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
let the spinnaker set watch how easy
this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.369> raise<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> sleeve<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this is as we raise the sleeve the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
this is as we raise the sleeve the
spinnaker<00:01:39.600> comes<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:40.979> there

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
spinnaker comes out and that's all there

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:41.840 
spinnaker comes out and that's all there
is<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
is to it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
is to it
and<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.329> you're<00:01:42.450> trimming<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> spinnaker

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and when you're trimming a spinnaker

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
and when you're trimming a spinnaker
you're<00:01:43.799> constantly<00:01:44.250> adjusting<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> sheet

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you're constantly adjusting the sheet

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
you're constantly adjusting the sheet
and<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> guy<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:46.229> every<00:01:46.530> change<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> wind

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and a guy with every change of the wind

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
and a guy with every change of the wind
whether<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.880> velocity<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.720> direction<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
whether it's velocity or direction and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.069 
whether it's velocity or direction and
the<00:01:49.920> same<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> true<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> mainsheet<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the same is true with the mainsheet the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.280 
the same is true with the mainsheet the
idea<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> ease<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.869> far<00:01:55.170> as

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
idea here is to ease it out as far as

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
idea here is to ease it out as far as
you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.649> until<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.460> sale<00:01:56.670> starts<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> flutter

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
you can until the sale starts to flutter

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
you can until the sale starts to flutter
or<00:01:57.780> luff<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> does<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> trim<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> sail

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
or luff if it does then I trim the sail

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.810 
or luff if it does then I trim the sail
back<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.630> every<00:02:01.409> time<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> wind<00:02:01.979> changes<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
back in every time the wind changes I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
back in every time the wind changes I
ease<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.540> out<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:04.200> trim<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.740> making<00:02:05.189> an

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
ease it out or trim it in making an

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700 
ease it out or trim it in making an
adjustment<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.420> every<00:02:06.689> puff<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.530> gain

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
adjustment and in every puff I can gain

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.180 
adjustment and in every puff I can gain
a<00:02:07.740> few<00:02:08.099> feet

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
a few feet

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.590 
a few feet
the<00:02:09.310> shape<00:02:09.520> isn't<00:02:09.850> quite<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:10.150> to<00:02:10.300> get<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
the shape isn't quite right to get the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.120 
the shape isn't quite right to get the
halyard<00:02:11.200> up<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.380> little<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.830> will<00:02:11.980> pull

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
halyard up a little bit and I will pull

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.590 
halyard up a little bit and I will pull
the<00:02:12.250> draft<00:02:12.550> forward<00:02:12.850> right<00:02:13.300> it'll<00:02:13.450> give<00:02:13.570> a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the draft forward right it'll give a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.170 
the draft forward right it'll give a
little<00:02:13.750> bit<00:02:13.870> more<00:02:14.050> balance<00:02:14.470> right<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
little bit more balance right now the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.060 
little bit more balance right now the
shape<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.870> full<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.650> too<00:02:17.830> far

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
shape is really full and it's too far

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.410 
shape is really full and it's too far
after<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.490> see<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> curvature<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
after you can see the curvature on the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
after you can see the curvature on the
sail<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.800> we<00:02:20.890> got<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.100> do<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.310> hey

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
sail is that so what we got to do is hey

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.730 
sail is that so what we got to do is hey
flatten<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.360> be<00:02:22.540> move<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.470> draft

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
flatten it out and be move the draft

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.230 
flatten it out and be move the draft
forward<00:02:24.040> nope<00:02:24.310> let's<00:02:24.670> go<00:02:24.820> ahead<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.210> can

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
forward nope let's go ahead and I can

00:02:25.240 --> 00:03:01.720 
forward nope let's go ahead and I can
take<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> cunningham<00:02:26.320> up

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.790
