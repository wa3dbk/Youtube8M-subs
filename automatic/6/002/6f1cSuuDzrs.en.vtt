00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello, we start your best channel 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.910
 technology my friend be my name is 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.099
 mario and today I will solve a 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.179
 problem that happened to me in week 1 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 I started using what is the environment 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.929
 from android I realized that I needed 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.490
 I an application in which I could 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 synchronize my device with my 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.670
 Mac computer searching and searching 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 against an application that is called here 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.449
 is and that application can be 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.970
 synchronized through windows or 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.289
 through mac the best of all is that it is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 a very simple interface you can 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.820
 drag your music your videos or your 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 files and be able to start working 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 without any problem on this side it appears 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.450
 the environment of my android a naut tablet 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.820
 and we are going to enter the application as 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 you can create it directly from the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 samsung page there you can 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 find for mac is a little bit more 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.829
 difficult but there are links where you can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.739
 carlos directly here shows you what 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.930
 is the firewall there is an update on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 this case the device gives you the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.710
 options to automatically synchronize 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 when you connect it whether it's the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 internal memory or external memory yo 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280
 I'm going to put that is external love for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.640
 default also gives you the option of this one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.390
 what is a backup if in this case in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.880
 my device 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.010
 the synchronization in this case what 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.970
 are your address book your 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.710
 study this appointments and synchronize music 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.690
 of the folder that you decide to do it 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.250
 automatically this is to say when I 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.869
 add a song to that folder 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 I automatically connect it with the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.330
 android and will also give 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.860
 photographs and also the videos me here 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.770
 if I want I activate them to be 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.630
 automatically when I decide 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 you can import what contacts are from 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.130
 your computer to the device or the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.899
 device to what is your computer 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.910
 in this case your music photos 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.190
 etcetera if they realize they give 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.960
 import and backup so that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.000
 you are creating by anything of your 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.800
 Android device I think it's a very 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.920
 good way to accept interface with your 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.840
 device just like this shows you 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.640
 the internal memory external name that is 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.140
 a memory that I add and you can 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.210
 start working without any problem 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.619
 on the left side shows you what 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.960
 is loaded on your device by 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.759
 example where it says music I'm going to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.800
 enter a music application for 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.789
 see what is loaded in pro 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.769
 play music 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.200
 well it will show me an environment of 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.349
 songs and some that I have in this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.790
 integrated case if I show the option 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.720
 of library which is what has been 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.350
 integrated into my mac and we look for some 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.840
 we will enter 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.180
 gorillaz 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.730
 what I do is that I can do it 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.599
 directly transfer to device or 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.340
 I can pull it to what is my 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 computer what forgives what is 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.950
 looking and giving internal memory 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.140
 external memory I will give you memory 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.269
 external since at the bottom they 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.700
 what is the transfer appears 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.730
 start to drive back to what is my 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.790
 Android and now realize will 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.920
 appear the new gorillaz disc for 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.930
 start listening to it this is different to 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.690
 music if I did it on video in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.060
 I look for what is a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.569
 photograph that you have loaded in what 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.090
 is my computer my mac in this case 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.720
 we have a moment and for example if I 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.630
 I want to put 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.000
 bender I'm going in this case my 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.450
 External number device starts to 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.450
 pull it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.670
 at the time of finishing it I will not go to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.770
 my gallery would have backgrounds gallery 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.040
 and that is on camera I'm going to put 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.569
 sell and I'll give you save 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.129
 and accounts are given in a very 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.040
 simple I can start creating my 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.950
 wallpapers for my device 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.349
 so we have this result, I liked it 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.170
 and also if you do it at the same time of videos 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.730
 you also go to the option of videos 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.050
 you just have to find the video that 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.280
 want to climb in this case 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:02.290
 I already have one that we are going to find another 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.629
 camila I'm going to what is my device 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.870
 begins to load see is a great 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.590
 speed although they are almost 12 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.849
 megas I'm going to my videos here in this case 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.520
 between the videos section of my 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.459
 device 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.110
 since camila is then a very 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.120
 good application remember you love qhilla 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.350
 is you can load it directly and what 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.200
 better is that you can also create it 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.030
