difficult<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.850> see<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.240> game<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:17.710> we're

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
difficult to see in a game I think we're

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.560 
difficult to see in a game I think we're
staying<00:02:18.100> away<00:02:18.310> from<00:02:18.340> child<00:02:18.790> soldiers<00:02:19.330> but

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
staying away from child soldiers but

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.660 
staying away from child soldiers but
women<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.170> men<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.350> course<00:02:20.800> that's<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.550> know

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
women and men of course that's you know

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.840 
women and men of course that's you know
for<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.240> that's<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.600> given<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:24.070> agents<00:02:24.640> are

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
for us that's a given the agents are

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.000 
for us that's a given the agents are
people<00:02:25.420> from<00:02:25.690> all<00:02:26.080> walks<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.500> life<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.860> society

people from all walks of life in society

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
people from all walks of life in society
it<00:02:27.610> would<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.209> men<00:02:28.390> or<00:02:28.510> women<00:02:28.810> children

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
it would be men or women children

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.350 
it would be men or women children
probably<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.370> much<00:02:30.550> because<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.000> requires

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
probably not so much because it requires

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.210 
probably not so much because it requires
training<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.410> some<00:02:32.620> background

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
training and and some background

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.760 
training and and some background

cycle<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.140> we<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.380> dynamic<00:02:56.620> weather<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
cycle and we have dynamic weather and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.690 
cycle and we have dynamic weather and
all<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:58.030> effects<00:02:58.570> how<00:02:58.780> how<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.560> world<00:02:59.860> or

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
all this effects how how the world or

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940 
all this effects how how the world or
how<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.570> interact<00:03:01.840> with<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.230> world<00:03:02.380> so

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
how you can interact with the world so

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.800 
how you can interact with the world so
there<00:03:03.280> could<00:03:03.459> be<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.610> snowstorm<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.239> example

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
or it could be in the middle of the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610 
or it could be in the middle of the
night<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.790> need<00:03:07.290> illumination<00:03:08.290> or<00:03:08.410> light

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
