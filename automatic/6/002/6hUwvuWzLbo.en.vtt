00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 [Music] 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 so that's almost done yes to mine 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.360
 command but I form a wheel ins 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 lager I do not understand that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.560
 Here is waiting for you somewhere 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 a blockade on me or was that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.350
 forward chances fire longer 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.350
 single it can already do that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.659
 against so many trolls 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.659
 [Music] 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:55.420
 and who quickly get started right away 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:05.740
 and the same time show how much there 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.540
 above is ideas for this 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.010
 worse 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 [Music] 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.490
 why go out again ? 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.780
 [Music] 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 before taxes I have that's 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:41.140
 survive at all because look something 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.729
 there comes so much 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 [Music] 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.410
 most of them are level 25 I know 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.289
 not how to do it yes follows 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.210
 I'll probably do that during my time 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.200
 try this last time follow me 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.229
 but only when I am stronger 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.070
 or if not more 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.070
 units off for the trolls 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.890
 [Music] 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.520
 but I can do that now 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.850
 theoretically with the troll too 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.340
 Titans we try without the opticians 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.930
 I also have to build it immediately 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.970
 executed and compatible so come but 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.750
 made equal 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.750
 Until next time
