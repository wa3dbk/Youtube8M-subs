00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.940
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 we prepare and install a can 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 that's what a can looks like for 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
 the art we lose we will deposit it on his 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 axis of cans 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.730
 we will take our coils of yarn 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.140
 will put on his support 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:29.810
 we will put it in small drums 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.270
 provided for this purpose here we will lay the wire 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.660
 in the can through a hole 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 provided for this purpose on the side we recover 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.809
 his son pushes the kz2 carette that goes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 switch on the engine and we will be able to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 press the pedal to fill its 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.020
 cinnamon can are filled all 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020
 only 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.909
 following the sewing we have to do 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.960

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.170
 we do not need to use high 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.170
 c 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.280
 there for example like this when we want 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.250
 fill the can is a brake 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.440
 blocks the can in time and art 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.650
 is automatically like these a 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 Once the can is filled we take it with 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.640
 the son on the left ie havas 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 went in the opposite direction of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.660
 clockwise or at the break 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.320
 in the case of cans like those 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.700
 one where it will rotate in the direction 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.080
 counterclockwise on 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.090
 sees well here it will pass in 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.390
 the slit at this place and come out in 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.040
 the throat that is there after putting on 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.410
 the son of the coil explained in 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.930
 other video we will get the movie from 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.840

 reel goes around the bobbin and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.080
 recover the film of canes is that one 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.670
 gap between the crowbar and the plate 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:31.090
 of culture like this is worth two sons
