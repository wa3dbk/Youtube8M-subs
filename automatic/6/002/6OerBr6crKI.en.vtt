on<00:02:02.000> it

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
on it

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.980

then what you'll want to do is grab your

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.180 
then what you'll want to do is grab your
new<00:02:06.110> processor<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.040> line<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:07.880> these

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
new processor and line it up with these

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.980 
new processor and line it up with these
this<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:11.030> if<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.870> bloom<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:13.990> don't

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
this right here if it bloom in don't

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.460 
this right here if it bloom in don't
know<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.410> will<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.450> line<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:18.410> that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
know if it will and line it up with that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.000 
know if it will and line it up with that
and<00:02:19.130> then<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> processor<00:02:20.450> has<00:02:21.320> it'll<00:02:21.770> fit

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
and then the processor has it'll fit

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.460 
and then the processor has it'll fit
right<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.520> with<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.720> missing<00:02:24.230> thing

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
right in with it that missing thing

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.990 
right in with it that missing thing
right<00:02:24.710> there<00:02:26.020> line<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.320> in<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.740> socket

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.400 

then<00:02:32.000> that's<00:02:32.240> all<00:02:32.420> lined<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:33.610> over<00:02:35.020> pull<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
then that's all lined up over pull the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.780 
then that's all lined up over pull the
this<00:02:37.100> back<00:02:37.370> down<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.030> make<00:02:38.120> sure<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:39.170> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this back down and make sure to get it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.880 
this back down and make sure to get it
underneath<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.300> little<00:02:41.620> holder<00:02:42.620> latch

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
underneath that little holder latch

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.180 
underneath that little holder latch
there<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:45.140> then<00:02:45.350> what<00:02:45.560> you're<00:02:45.680> gonna<00:02:45.800> want<00:02:46.100> to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
there and then what you're gonna want to

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.260 
there and then what you're gonna want to
do<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:48.220> take<00:02:49.220> your<00:02:50.290> CPU<00:02:51.290> heatsink<00:02:52.150> want<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
do you take your CPU heatsink want to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.170 
do you take your CPU heatsink want to
line<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.480> up<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.110> back<00:02:54.320> here<00:02:56.739> but<00:02:57.739> these

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
line that up in the back here but these

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:14.910 
line that up in the back here but these
let's<00:02:59.620> let<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.650> fall<00:03:01.130> back<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.640> place
