00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.109
 yes and so hello and cordial 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 welcome to this video i have 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.620
 now since christmas the 13 inch 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.910
 macbook pro with retina display and wants 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.320
 show you in this video what's up 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.269
 but also strengthen the weaknesses of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.450
 Notebooks are so much fun with this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450
 Video 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.210
 i have the macbook pro with 8 gb ram 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 and 256gb ssd 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.810
 there are no visible ones 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.270
 to the former model the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.220
 macbook pro from the year 2012 up on 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.230
 that the macbook pro 2013 one 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.670
 millimeter has become thinner but that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 usually does not come up 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.730
 We are the first to open the connections 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.680
 on the left side we find two 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.160
 Microphones whose sound are quite good 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.230
 a headphone input usb 3.0 port 24 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.970
 ports and ingenious magsafe 2 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.680
 Connection for charging the connection 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.449
 the magnetic and the advantage of it is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.320
 that when pulling on a cable nothing 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.210
 can break 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.580
 also exists on the other side 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.890
 another usb port a hdmi and a network 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.950
 xc card slot the macbook pro 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.740
 owns a retina display with 2560 x 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 1600 pixels the viewing angles are absolute 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.990
 ingenious 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.729
 that is what it means from all directions 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.500
 can look at the display without that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.299
 the reflections are a bit blurry 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.860
 are actually minimal and if you are 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.090
 but not recognizing something fits 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.560
 the display automatically turns on 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.270
 Brightness to the island haswell 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.190
 processors lend the 13 inch 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.720
 macbook pro dreamlike battery life 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.880
 They work much more energy-efficient 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.140
 as the old nine hours gives apple 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.760
 at the 13 counters 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.890
 Of course, it also depends on what 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.480
 But that makes normal surfing possible 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.310
 internet and e-mails do not read at all 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.930
 problem a purchase reason for me was up 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.090
 any case that you are the macbook 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.140
 consists only of aluminum and glass what 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.820
 looks really classy 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.440
 june berlin is called the housing and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.510
 means that the mac is out of a block 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.160
 aluminum was milled out and later 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.990
 the technical room just behind 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.670
 the substructure was used 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 Perfectly balanced so I'm at 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.940
 Lift the display of the lower part 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.650
 the notebook is not moved up 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.150
 that's pretty cool and was mine 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.650
 old laptop he is not the case 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.540
 By the way, the keys can also be used 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.310
 All wonderfully press the keyboard 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.140
 Backlight ensures that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.790
 you can work in the dark without too 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.470
 to make a fool of ourselves 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.970
 but now I first lie down 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.209
 as noted at the beginning 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.879
 the 256 gb ssd granted and these ssds 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.269
 really fast read the and 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.760
 Write speeds are included 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.510
 about 600 30 to 100 megabytes each 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.250
 second 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.260
 I upload my videos currently still 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.120
 with a uv and when i am there at the video 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.920
 Do not export yourself really long 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.510
 wait until it's done the macbook pro 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460
 took only about 14 seconds 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.260
 boot 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.700
 You can count on those old times 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.290
 never in the life what he needed 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.210
 always four to five minutes 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.860
 but now I have often praised the max 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.930
 that you directly ask if that's it 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.970
 has no weaknesses but has it 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.770
 maybe there are a few people below 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.570
 you like to be in bed on the couch 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.430
 or want to work somewhere else and 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.960
 because the problem already appears on the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.600
 Fans are unfortunately on the bottom 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.010
 built-in so that this dust 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.840
 and other small particles in it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.880
 inside saw all the leads in the end to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.590
 that the air starts very loud too 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.210
 hum and the mc gets hot that is 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.950
 actually not a big criticism 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.600
 but maybe you could do that in the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.100
 next model will change more minuses 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.020
 I did not find anything in total 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.850
 Can I give a clear buy recommendation for 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.040
 pronounce the macbook pro because the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.080
 fast ssd the long battery life and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.790
 then this ingenious retina display 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.500
 make a very good one as a pro 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.910
 laptop for on the way but the price 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.030
 makes for many a line through the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.250
 bill because apple requires 1299 euro 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.910
 for the basic version and for the high 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.530
 end model whole 1799 euro there are the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.510
 students and teachers really happy about 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.100
 the apple education store where you 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.360
 save about a hundred euros 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.890
 since we are already at my this 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.420
 videos would have arrived 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.430
 really huge over a thumb after 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.990
 I'm looking forward to this video I have to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.700
 maybe do it twice because of that 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.140
 first lost somehow 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.160
 share this video with yours 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.780
 friends when they are in front of you 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.310
 purchase decision but otherwise 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.410
 I have nothing else to say 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.740
 as we'll see you in the next video and 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.740
 until then 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:06.040
 do you like apple do you like macbooks? 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.040
 you at max
