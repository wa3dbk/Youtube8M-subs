00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
before so how I believe this course it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.920 
before so how I believe this course it
was<00:03:17.879> actually<00:03:18.180> pieced<00:03:18.389> together<00:03:18.540> and

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
was actually pieced together and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.409 
was actually pieced together and
constructed<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.459> believe<00:03:20.519> they<00:03:20.909> started

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
constructed is I believe they started

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.240 
constructed is I believe they started
with<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.870> two<00:03:22.260> panels<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:23.010> top<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
with the two panels at they top the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.099 
with the two panels at they top the
corset<00:03:23.760> attitude<00:03:24.120> panels<00:03:24.419> at<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.659> bottom<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
corset attitude panels at the bottom of

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.589 
corset attitude panels at the bottom of
the<00:03:25.200> corset<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:25.919> below<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.000> belt<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.329> above

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
the corset here below the belt and above

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.409 
the corset here below the belt and above
the<00:03:27.720> belt<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:29.069> those<00:03:29.340> together<00:03:29.549> then

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
the belt on so those together then

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.659 
the belt on so those together then
assemble<00:03:30.989> them<00:03:31.109> together<00:03:31.260> using<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.310> belt

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
assemble them together using this belt

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.280 
assemble them together using this belt
area<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.180> an<00:03:33.329> anchor<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.079> there's

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
area as an anchor so you can see there's

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.219 
area as an anchor so you can see there's
the<00:03:34.470> satin<00:03:34.859> belt<00:03:35.849> that's<00:03:36.419> all<00:03:36.659> in<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.019> piece

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
the satin belt that's all in one piece

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.110 
the satin belt that's all in one piece
here<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.979> inside<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.669> also<00:03:38.819> see

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
here and on the inside you can also see

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.569 
here and on the inside you can also see
an<00:03:39.419> identical<00:03:40.199> twin<00:03:40.470> belt<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.250> inside

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
an identical twin belt on the inside

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.770 
an identical twin belt on the inside
there<00:03:42.530> then<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.859> believe<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.669> they<00:03:45.180> put<00:03:45.629> on

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
there then I believe that they put on

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.129 
there then I believe that they put on
the<00:03:45.989> front<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.620> back<00:03:47.180> panels<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.540> for

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
the front and the back panels here for

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.890 
the front and the back panels here for

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the center front center back and like I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.319 
the center front center back and like I
showed<00:03:52.079> on<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> inside<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.159> now<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:54.090> have

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
showed on the inside just now they have

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.020 
showed on the inside just now they have
