for<00:00:32.079> trains<00:00:32.500> but<00:00:33.070> my<00:00:33.220> latest<00:00:33.670> research

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
for trains but my latest research

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.680 
for trains but my latest research
project<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:34.870> magnet<00:00:35.470> powered<00:00:35.890> train<00:00:36.629> now<00:00:37.629> we

project is a magnet powered train now we

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.340 
project is a magnet powered train now we
all<00:00:37.930> know<00:00:37.960> magnets<00:00:38.530> have<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.739> powerful<00:00:39.100> force

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
all know magnets have a powerful force

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.960 
all know magnets have a powerful force
but<00:00:41.350> how<00:00:41.500> do<00:00:41.559> you<00:00:41.620> harness<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.220> power<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.850> get

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
but how do you harness that power to get

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.310 
but how do you harness that power to get
a<00:00:43.030> train<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.449> move<00:00:45.180> well<00:00:46.180> with<00:00:46.780> magnets
