00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 moving on now the time has come for motorcycles with little more 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.349
 geek 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.239
 you do not vote, we'll show you another one of a kind 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.090
 segments that have grown the most in the national market 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.710
 this time we will talk about the bandit 650s the most sporty version and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 fairing of the famous motome that is dirty 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.200
 the banditry as well as most chainsaws followed by the cpi is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.070
 designed to offer comfort with a good performance so efficient both 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
 in urban areas and on the roads 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.250
 as every new generation has been totally redesigned and offers 6 156 displacements 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.970
 and liquid cooling which guarantees not only greater power but also 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 lower emission of pollutants 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.910
 the double steel crib chassis is more difficult 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.670
 is exactly to accompany the new power of banditry 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.950
 the front suspension is the telescopes since the semedo hydraulic death 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.700
 and it can be adjusted to suit different loads or preferences 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.610
 of the pilot the rear suspension in turn is mono-cut and works 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 progressively 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.870
 but the great carina g of the band its goes well beyond the visual appeal 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.559
 because it is designed to let you drive at higher speeds more 

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:49.580
 behaved 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.299
 but despite being a 650 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.830
 the bike conveys a great feeling of weight to the rider something that can be 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.590
 a bit tiring over three days with three more 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 this occurs because of some exaggerated items like the stainless steel ferrule 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.610
 on the central trestle and besides being already heavy it is somewhat obsolete nowadays 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.810
 focusing on the comfort of the driver the barbells as they are known 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.599
 has a regulation of 10 mm in height on the bench on two levels 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.269
 can be up to 20 mm higher or lower important detail for 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.540
 make driving safer for lower people 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.090
 The dashboard is modern with the analog-gauge turns on a lcd screen with 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.090
 speedometer margin indicator 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.949
 for you that I put with a motorcycle of average displacement has already left the 250 but still 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.929
 does not have information that sports 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.279
 prioritizes bandit comfort and is one more option 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.939
 the idea is that we have to take into account that it will always prioritize 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.139
 comfort 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.170
 however also having a good power
