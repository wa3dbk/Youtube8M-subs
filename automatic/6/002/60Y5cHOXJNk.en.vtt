00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.600
 ServÃ© those videos we decided to shoot 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.610
 in order to eliminate customer errors 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.549
 who are trying to repair furniture 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.179
 their mistakes themselves used often leads 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.769
 to the fact that even professionals are not in 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.539
 able to correct their mistakes here we are 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:26.000
 would like you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.599
 if you do something you did without errors 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.740
 so that we can suffer with yours 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.400
 mistakes means before proceeding 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:43.860
 Further work needs to remove this one. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.410
 Here is a brown sticky substance 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.960
 old foam that turns here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.810
 into such a sticky substance this sticky 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.650
 substance substance falling on the floor 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.640
 sticks to it him 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.790
 and it is very difficult to wash it washed 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 it is generally a simple soap solution but 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 it is very difficult therefore it is necessary everywhere 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.230
 collect if you don't do that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.180
 then it's sticky substance dad dad 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.760
 gets on the new fabric 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 so fast you can't even do it 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.490
 this will not have time to notice here now these 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.710
 I need to remove all the nails too then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 I will explain why we proceed to sticking 100 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.060
 compounds that are glued and hold me 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.450
 I advise you not to touch it because you can 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 at breakdown of these compounds break off 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 spikes and eyes means there is still 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.310
 such problems here here can be 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.780
 cracks if she is here in the eye 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.830
 then you need to disconnect it to let 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 glue and put in 8 hours 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.940
 it is necessary to use any liquid air defense 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.190
 nails 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.700
 no rubber to me for that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.700
 fit 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.540
 we want to offer your repair 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.240
 chair seat 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.020
 have chosen the most diligent chair 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:34.350
 which year sets the frame with 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.450
 broken with a broken eyelet with 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.370
 broken snakes who were standing here 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.680
 metal springs were not broken 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.170
 can restore snakes no sense 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.900
 because you need to strengthen the frame not not 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.760
 changing the details how to do it but you 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.610
 now show 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.950
 Well, I removed all the excess surface 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:05.350
 wood old foam rubber and old nails we 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:10.340
 We start sticking this compound 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:26.000
 take glue pva put it on the plane 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:29.200
 and to the place of a break and we smear than 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.200
 what do you have i use pieces 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 school 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:59.269
 we smear the entire surface of the eyelets here 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:10.110
 now we take glue and coat the spikes 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:10.910
 same place kinks don't be afraid to put 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:28.080
 excess glue 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:30.590
 since it will be deleted later 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.590
 way 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.290
 Now we insert a helluva lot of ears well, 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.690
 try to make everything fall into place 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:49.850
 to glue the joint at the break point 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:54.440
 coincided as needed and take in the wet 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.870
 rag and wipe off the excess glue that has 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:24.070
 we were on then take 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:24.070
 clamps and grip this way 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.710
 then wipe off the excess glue again 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:55.429
 and leave to dry 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:06:00.289
 but I do not recommend less than 8:00 Well 

00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:03.909
 in fact we will finish all the work of us 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:07.689
 turned out good reliable 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.919
 invest for the chair in the following 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:13.009
 videos we will tell you how 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.959
 properly re-stick the chair and if you 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:21.939
 You will do it yourself as it is right and 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:21.939
 how to hide the next meetings
