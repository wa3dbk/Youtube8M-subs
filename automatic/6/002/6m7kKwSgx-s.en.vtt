what<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> possibility<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.120> maybe

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
what is a possibility I think that maybe

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.180 
what is a possibility I think that maybe
it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.120 
it
a<00:02:13.220> gene<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.780> taught<00:02:15.050> him<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.410> power<00:02:15.650> or

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
a gene that taught him that power or

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
a gene that taught him that power or
gave<00:02:16.460> him<00:02:16.640> advice<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.180> something<00:02:17.510> like

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
gave him advice to do something like

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.300 
gave him advice to do something like
that<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.470> silly<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that because it's so silly and it's so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.830 
that because it's so silly and it's so
out<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.490> character<00:02:19.610> for<00:02:20.030> kite<00:02:20.210> if<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.720> up

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
out of character for kite if it was up

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.930 
out of character for kite if it was up
to<00:02:20.870> kite<00:02:21.110> he'd<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> giant<00:02:22.430> freaking

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940

missile or some crazy but to have

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.560 
missile or some crazy but to have
some<00:02:25.250> sort<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.550> clown<00:02:25.790> thing<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.360> looks<00:02:26.510> like

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
some sort of clown thing that looks like

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.540 
some sort of clown thing that looks like
a<00:02:26.660> practical<00:02:27.290> joke<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.620> gene<00:02:28.010> played<00:02:28.250> on<00:02:28.400> him

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a practical joke that gene played on him

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.340 
a practical joke that gene played on him
maybe<00:02:28.730> he<00:02:28.910> taught<00:02:29.150> him<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.510> maybe<00:02:29.900> gave<00:02:30.200> him

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
maybe he taught him that maybe gave him

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.900 
maybe he taught him that maybe gave him
the<00:02:30.440> idea<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.070> or<00:02:31.220> something<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:31.820> just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
the idea of that or something it's just

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.420 
the idea of that or something it's just
really<00:02:32.180> freaking<00:02:32.600> weird<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.350> funny<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.280> he

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
really freaking weird and funny that he

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.710 
really freaking weird and funny that he
has<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.760> power<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.150> I'm<00:02:35.210> thinking<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.630> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
has that power and I'm thinking that it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.510 
has that power and I'm thinking that it
was<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.840> possibility<00:02:36.290> somebody<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.190> gene

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
was a possibility somebody like gene

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.940 
was a possibility somebody like gene
taught<00:02:38.090> him<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.270> do<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.590> was<00:02:39.680> kind<00:02:39.890> of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
taught him to do it so that was kind of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.000 
taught him to do it so that was kind of
funny<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.430> also<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:41.990> four<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.950 
funny and also if that was a four that
he<00:02:43.130> used<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.670> one<00:02:43.880> end<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.240> he<00:02:44.600> took<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960
