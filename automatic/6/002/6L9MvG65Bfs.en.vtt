 notice that you were going to upload videos to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.680
 Upload a video etc. Etcetera Etcetera

 pronunciation is very 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.800
 especially in each person one is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390

 in short that is the same game is the same 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.290
 interested the game 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.560
 I had money the truth so that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.910
 emotional and you follow father two ways 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 I'm going to record it and I'm going to upload it 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.600

 another that battle time people without pajamas 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.780
 Obviously seeing all appointment date but 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.369
 well let's go with him 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 what I like is how you want them to be 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.900
 super sharp and it's easier to open it than 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
 with the greens I had the other day 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.220
 they want the greens that I play with 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.600

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.530
 well to open a game yes 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 is the problem that we need as a 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.440
 tripod or something like that to be able to do everything 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.560
 what I need if I do not know what the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.970
 people do it is a tripod but good 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 there is great with my solar because neither 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.290
 I can not pierre green wonders to a 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.850

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.140
 that exist do they inhabit in any 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.090
 technology because there are many times 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.769
 things but good 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.019
 the game of 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:51.500
 as I told princesses and give gifts 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.069
 your birthday or if seen here yes good 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 these are mild things 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.329
 if it can be carried on the part of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.340
 sensitive adjustment or yaya tom box 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.290
 raider trolling less than a principle that 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 barbara that is becoming special from 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.470
 a principle but good if we want it and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.440
 we want it 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.070
 and if they go and because I have a long 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.070
 net people 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.519
 Demon box 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.130
 been from the other side in the video 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.080
 chihuahua box 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.870
 It makes me want to hit him 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.069
 There is an end point if it is good 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.920
 security I guess that's the important thing 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.849
 this had fallen not stain it not 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.290
 it will be the chihuahua album 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.400
 Now I'm going a little bit hungry chihuahua 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.019
 for having the box 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.139
 the sun disc split that I did hear 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.879
 that it brought as the loose disk because what 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.930
 best style and I think there has been 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.359
 a code to see this code what it is 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.430
 the code of this series although good 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.919
 this been good that no serial code 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.250
 I know if they saw it's kingdom because something 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:09.709
 special what uaw that your days in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.650
 double scull humanity my father my father 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.579
 the roll gave us this and then 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.530
 it also comes to that started what content 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.539
 Downloadable goals to pass such thing 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.360
 that they gave me in this committee and after 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.520
 I will teach you what is all that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.949
 Regarding downloadable content and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.449
 good and the unofficial manually 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.099
 roll and already normally in games if 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.259
 they have an integrated manual so they do not 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.750
 make it be so much paper and that the roll are 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.360
 ecologists party that comes out more good 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.030
 nice cheap 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.469
 in the end we are going with theoretical carlos that I 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.580
 I think we deserved a boxing but I 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.599
 I want to make a good time 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.599
 epic game 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:58.260
 very well very well very well now yes 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.490
 with the sharp point better here does not want 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.760
 the game of the devil 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:09.580
 do not get 'princess like tomb raider 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.730
 is that they are princesses and an experience 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.340
 7 to know the truth sometimes comes out to 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.660
 people, we are girls, I really want one 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.350
 sometimes and not just on our side 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.350
 little princess 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.349
 maybe with the left I think it 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.349
 they give me better apart the right 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.469
 and apart because it means that we're going to 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.030
 do more editing with more people 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.770
 because in it it is for everyone 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.180
 right now buying more things for xbox 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.710
 then by way to living in greater 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.189
 with very good systems saying the camera 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.960
 towards the other side of my bed in me is 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.849
 would mean more lighting with carlos and 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.830
 geo the best with klaus eder to the best 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.340
 with this already three people and with 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.469
 sticks also if you have seen the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.590
 Carlos's channel is what I'm 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.590
 talking 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.690
 that we feel included ok if they are peace 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.990

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.990
 very well 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:21.599
 four of the packages for 10 dollars 17 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:23.740
 normal days that you feel with me 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:27.400
 I have like 21 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.930

 not so those typical plus the up 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.199
 that this one does not come to your any code nor 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.230
 nothing special 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.810
 so 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.460
 here they did not leave more poor more stingy 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.260
 they did not give us anything nothing people do not believe 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.870
 the good thing is that we already have these two 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.820
 games then if you liked the video if 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.610
 they liked what they see is what they 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.070
 approximate in the channel that they give a like 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.390
 subscribe I do not know if they like the 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.150
 atmosphere of what it was that I bring to 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.190
 Sometimes in the end he asks me for 25 and 28 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.540
 fuel a box and they do not need you go super 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.890
