00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.709
 berger and so on in the next video here 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.360
 the channel and a new player 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.160
 review again today with a 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.560
 last and how it wished you whether 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.660
 Landon Donovan team of the season the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.310
 legend the man of the American 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.720
 Football is the biggest legend in the world 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.759
 American football and of course 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.289
 again these get in the constant 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.210
 he has good performances for a short time 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.349
 played in europe at everton 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.090
 but never made it to the breakthrough 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.310
 a decree but great and that's why 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.220
 this card with 89 tempo drive has the 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.930
 dribbling 85 shooting 80 fit 69 euro 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.940
 I have three stalls working for forest 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.140
 skills and he has six goals in 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.580
 four games and made only 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.110
 have two templates by exchange 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.180
 offered he costs but I think im 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.890
 moment about 60 km not particularly 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.240
 expensive and actually pretty 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.830
 quietly puts in games that are now seeing 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.940
 if the comfortable being left 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.740
 is in the video description could 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.450
 for example, credit a credit balance now 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.940
 also smuggle everything relatively cheap too 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.770
 get there and who supports it and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.090
 At the moment there are over men of dull 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.620
 the text is definitely worth it 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.640
 Here seven games set and must be completely 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.439
 Honestly, that looks pretty good 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 It looks awesome and it looks very solid too 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.159
 for such a player with an 85 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.390
 rating but of course the question is first 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.590
 usually quite midfielder 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.670
 or left midfielder it was 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.300
 last year as right 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 midfield player 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.860
 the question is of course how does he do it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 open space like plug away that he 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.010
 none of the state money and has to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.060
 example makes that very good makes us 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.200
 really good he pretty much got me 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.050
 impressed I honestly would 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 nothing expected from him but I was 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.080
 really surprised because tim has me 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.550
 I do not deserve cahill 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.710
 I resold directly but landon 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.450
 donovan was just clear for now 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.299
 faster so he really was very very 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.280
 on the way are surprised but also 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.170
 relatively solid so not somehow like that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.370
 a player who runs and then loses 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.930
 he has the ball because he has no balance 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.490
 no one likes to strengthen the body 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.870
 that was fast, it had everything 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.070
 still body does not strengthen that much though 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.200
 definitely enough for a few 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.369
 defender there so stuck and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.659
 that was really nice here 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.890
 See also his walks were also 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.610
 very good as he is really a very good guy 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.710
 good striker 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 because he also anticipates 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 Anticipated passports of the midfielder 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.430
 that means he just has good positioning 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.780
 be quite simply dribbling 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.729
 as I said is also very good 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.030
 have seen here comes out quickly 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.130
 the kick has one 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.560
 the first touch first days at first 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.940
 has and that is all wonderful account 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.100
 about complaints just as little about 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.660
 his passing game both short and long 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.040
 that's extremely precise and I like that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.620
 very much because his flanks are really coming 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.910
 extremely extremely precise to such a 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.900
 striker like johnson standing next to it 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.069
 Man no more problems 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.690
 but also his long and short ones 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.819
 The president will be very precise because of you 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.440
 always directly on the foot comes and we 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.209
 we are right in the running and the like 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 me extremely well because that can not be so 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.390
 Many players as good as Landon Donovan 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 team on this at least not with me 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 could be due to that at the moment I 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 but at landon donovan had that 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.950
 relatively shut off with me and that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.150
 Of course, that's why I should go 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.220
 Again, the player really a lot 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.570
 has fun and that my highlight 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.160
 with him of course is not the header 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.540
 that is alright first 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.100
 Kopfball also made that here now 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.630
 the rest will be recorded 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.280
 so he can behead he came 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.810
 but head duels win that now 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.489
 not a highlight nor again 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.690
 into pending as cdm or as 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.950
 Center Forward I would not be honest 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.959
 although it may be with a striker 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.459
 because scm or zm I would be me 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.989
 point out that he theoretically go 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.030
 was from the information the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.500
 position data but be my highlight 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.540
 is a shot and his shot is 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.180
 really bombastic as well as tables 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.350
 16 he has a really good one 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.700
 fitness shot you have to be honest 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.620
 say and he is really right 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.850
 Good deal with both left and 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.650
 also with right left of course with the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.700
 spokesman the report is nevertheless 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.530
 do not even shit so 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 Forsthofgut you notice in any case 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 that really is not bad and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 his normal shot as the powershot 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.180
 is both from the distance so from the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.500
 near his free kicks are really good 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.180
 well his eleven meters are good so one 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.560
 standard he can shoot corners 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.170
 the boy can just everybody is that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 only negative environment so a bit 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.810
 says a forsters then applies it though 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 just stop with this extremely good 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.519
 shot you see here again 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.019
 becomes 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.280
 it's really one of the most important things 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.060
 high firepower for a good one 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.350
 precision 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.640
 that's all right and you will 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.500
 at the same time sometime also one 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.170
 really blatant long shot see that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.239
 negative is once the league of course 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.040
 I do not mean the mls right now 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.200
 league of dreams because there are relative 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.609
 many links that are somehow good for 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.560
 him for example dempsey and something 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.090
 but is still the mls and it 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.220
 is still difficult to link labels 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.400
 at bsg great but otherwise change 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.120
 here comes the longchamp something as well 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.500
 a bit negative 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.449
 the us american is if he now into the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.160
 Brazilians would be okay though 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.320
 It americans because there is not really 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.280
 so many left in the mls and that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.990
 bit of a shame but this is actually 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.669
 only two negative aspects as well 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.870
 like the three star skills because he too 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.370
 it is not really that expensive 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.810
 affordable and I would say he 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.370
 is worth it for all the rewe leaves 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.840
 have him or like a few 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.160
 then players want to try 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
 donovan always try it out too 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.250
 really is pretty pretty good 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.710
 To be honest, welcome to say 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.360
 positive and negative in countries very much 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.590
 fast agile and good balance good 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.240
 Ball treatment as I said a good one 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.949
 if touch high shot power top 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.400
 Graduation and both very good 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.300
 precise matching relatively strong report 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.010
 decent header for such a little one 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.090
 striker some good left you guys 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.949
 which games are fast here or 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.229
 bradley does not cost as much as it does 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.580
 said only 60 km and the negative 3 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.560
 stand it is still on the times 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.820
 bad league of the world and the nation 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.680
 Of course, that's not optimal either 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.210
 with the united states of america 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.699
 Nevertheless, we come all in all 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440
 a rating of 9.2 out of 10 for landon 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.580
 donovan team on this one really 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.229
 very very good card which I like very much 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.100
 I just liked them 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.539
 Recommend 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.979
 because I have to say quite honestly for that 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.990
 Price you can barely get a better one 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.520
 striker or center forward and that 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.020
 should always take into account, too 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.099
 he is quick to link and this 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.889
 hard to link factor is the 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.710
 only point wise, why he 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.280
 from ten out of ten to nine out of ten 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.289
 go down 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.400
 I liked it again if yes last 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.510
 the positive one and there writes me 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.590
 comments which players it next 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.000
 would like to have reviewed would 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.250
 It's something to be happy about and you have to 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.250
 again from russian day until then out of pure
