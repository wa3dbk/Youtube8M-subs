00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.209
 blessed wolf returns very welcome guest 

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:13.609
 on the stage of the greens to interpret 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.490
 the first of four concerts for 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.770
 rachmaninov piano that this year 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.490
 the greens will perform in full 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.640
 what is the charm of this particular 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.869
 concert so for me I do this 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.949
 concert is the fusion of themes 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.980
 absolutely romantic and 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.960
 an elaboration of these themes 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.090
 a writing already more modern than 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.840
 what we heard in the second e 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.320
 this is the third concert because the maneuver 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:52.500
 completely revised in 1917 then 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.840
 is this strange mention between a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 of the themes that even fashions of the gods 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 tv styling can remember the clicks on 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.700
 costs and very modern harmonization 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.960
 a much more performance 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.010
 lively 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.900
 this creates a lot of interaction what 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.230
 asked for a difficult concert also for 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.520
 orchestra with 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.590
 first time very dramatic with one 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 great cadence a second time 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.000
 in my opinion really beautiful of so 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.900
 I sing very very Russian but with gods 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.030
 colors also particular of almost almost 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.310
 impressionistic certain certain gusts so 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.100
 I become that they feel and then in third 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 time that is extremely bright almost 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.850
 I would say burlesque and maybe it didn't sound 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.350
 how it deserves not just because it is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.450
 quite difficult but also because it is 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.540
 very different from the most popular since 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.520
 second and third so maybe one 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.990
 expect first concert a bit 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.160
 that kind of vein instead like the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.610
 fourth is something extremely 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.400
 different but the fourth one a lot 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.200
 dark dark is extremely concentrated 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 also an emotional point of view with gods 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.429
 Very fragmented themes here we have e 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.810
 cassis themes cantabili themes of yes 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.140
 recall 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.760
 this concert of the written question 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.709
 very young at only 18 years, however 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.270
 version we know is that 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.270
 let's say so remodeled 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.520
 here's what you feel about the young man 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 rackman according to me is just the themes and it is 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.920
 truly an absolutely daughter work 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 of the time to which the altered 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.510
 extremely interesting to compare the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.730
 two parts 2 huge distance 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.400
 stylistic that exists between the versions like this 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.080
 as also huge to see how far I walk 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.819
 of he had already done when he wrote it 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.860
 the second concert really there is 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.960
 was already a first revolution 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.360
 very difficult of the holidays when 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.740
 very lively revenue in many milan 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.980
 I am much more in dialogue than we are 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.230
 compared to the previous concerts this 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.230
 I highly resemble the last one
