we've<00:00:09.000> been<00:00:09.150> very<00:00:09.300> fortunate<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.019> each

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
we've been very fortunate in that each

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:26.830 
we've been very fortunate in that each
year<00:00:10.530> we've<00:00:10.740> seen<00:00:10.920> our<00:00:11.190> production<00:00:12.769> increase

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.650 

five<00:00:27.840> days<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.560> week<00:00:29.510> we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.689> long<00:00:31.170> shift

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
five days a week we have one long shift

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.880 
five days a week we have one long shift
we<00:00:33.660> start<00:00:34.050> up<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.410> early<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.510> midnight<00:00:36.890> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
we start up as early as midnight that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
we start up as early as midnight that
production<00:00:38.250> off<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.820> 3:30<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> everything<00:00:40.980> we

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
production off at 3:30 and everything we

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
production off at 3:30 and everything we
do<00:00:41.370> must<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.790> cleaned<00:00:42.180> washed<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> sanitized

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
do must be cleaned washed and sanitized

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.660 
do must be cleaned washed and sanitized
every<00:00:44.309> day<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> process<00:00:46.680> starts<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.190> our

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
every day so the process starts with our

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.900 
every day so the process starts with our
milk<00:00:47.969> receiving<00:00:49.370> depending<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
milk receiving depending on the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
milk receiving depending on the
production<00:00:51.329> schedule<00:00:51.980> we<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.190> be

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
production schedule we could be

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
production schedule we could be
receiving<00:00:54.289> seven<00:00:55.730> six<00:00:56.730> thousand<00:00:57.270> gallon

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
receiving seven six thousand gallon

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.310 
receiving seven six thousand gallon
tankers<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> raw<00:00:58.410> milk<00:00:58.680> daily<00:01:00.320> take

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
tankers of raw milk daily take

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
tankers of raw milk daily take
approximately<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.160> cream<00:01:02.430> loads<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
approximately three cream loads and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.609 
approximately three cream loads and
that's<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.390> six<00:01:03.780> thousand<00:01:04.170> gallons<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's about six thousand gallons of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.940 
that's about six thousand gallons of
food<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> weekly<00:01:06.180> basis<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.830> do

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
food on a weekly basis and then we do

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120 
food on a weekly basis and then we do
use<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.270> powder<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.290> cocoa

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
use the powder and some other cocoa

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030 
use the powder and some other cocoa
powder<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.299> hour

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.770 

so<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.750> have<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.170> processing<00:01:17.740> area<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.460> where

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so we have in processing area to where

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.900 
so we have in processing area to where
the<00:01:19.780> liquid<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.590> dry<00:01:20.800> ingredients<00:01:21.550> are<00:01:21.700> mixed

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
the liquid and dry ingredients are mixed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.540 
the liquid and dry ingredients are mixed
and<00:01:22.210> blended<00:01:22.270> together<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.350> make<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:26.550> 1600

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
and blended together to make a 1600

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.060 
and blended together to make a 1600
gallon<00:01:27.670> mix<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:29.050> there<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.620> is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
gallon mix from there it is

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.100 
gallon mix from there it is
pasteurize

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.930 

to<00:01:35.770> where<00:01:35.980> we<00:01:36.280> kill<00:01:36.940> all<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:38.940> pappardelle

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
to where we kill all of the pappardelle

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.410 
to where we kill all of the pappardelle
for<00:01:40.300> turns<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:41.200> then<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.370> part<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.820> stored<00:01:43.120> in

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
for turns and then the part is stored in

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.180 
for turns and then the part is stored in
what<00:01:43.540> we<00:01:43.690> call<00:01:43.900> tank<00:01:44.230> alley<00:01:44.530> at<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.430> minimum<00:01:45.970> of

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
what we call tank alley at a minimum of

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880 
what we call tank alley at a minimum of
40<00:01:48.190> degrees<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.180> now<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.890> pasteurized

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
40 degrees so now you have a pasteurized

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.969 
40 degrees so now you have a pasteurized
liquid<00:01:51.520> mix<00:01:51.820> that's<00:01:52.660> in<00:01:52.840> our<00:01:52.960> storage<00:01:53.380> tanks

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
liquid mix that's in our storage tanks

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.990 
liquid mix that's in our storage tanks
that<00:01:54.100> are<00:01:54.220> now<00:01:54.400> ready<00:01:54.700> for<00:01:55.710> packaging<00:01:57.000> we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
that are now ready for packaging we

machines are producing X 240 cups of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.350 
machines are producing X 240 cups of
minutes<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.800> actually<00:02:27.160> make<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.820> cups<00:02:28.090> here

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
minutes you actually make the cups here

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.780 
minutes you actually make the cups here
or<00:02:28.540> they<00:02:28.750> brought<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.280> both

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
or they brought in we do both

scored at 40 degrees

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.550 
scored at 40 degrees
we<00:02:49.819> bring<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.240> mix-up<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.020> it<00:02:51.230> makes<00:02:51.410> us

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
we bring out a mix-up and it makes us

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.300 
we bring out a mix-up and it makes us
put<00:02:51.770> into<00:02:52.180> flavor<00:02:53.180> tanks<00:02:53.690> from<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.069> add

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
put into flavor tanks from there we add

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.910 
put into flavor tanks from there we add
any<00:02:55.700> additional<00:02:56.080> flavoring<00:02:57.080> following

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
any additional flavoring following

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.960 
any additional flavoring following
whatever<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.430> recipe<00:02:58.640> calls<00:02:59.090> for<00:02:59.270> to<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.380> mix

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
whatever the recipe calls for to the mix

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.460 
whatever the recipe calls for to the mix
from<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.150> flavor<00:03:02.420> tank<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.990> mix<00:03:03.230> goes

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
from the flavor tank the mix goes

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.840 
from the flavor tank the mix goes
through<00:03:03.920> an<00:03:04.490> ice<00:03:04.730> cream<00:03:05.000> freezer<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:07.459> use<00:03:07.700> the
