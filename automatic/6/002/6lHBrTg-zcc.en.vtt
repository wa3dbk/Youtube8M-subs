unboxing video for this one but the same
version<00:00:33.200> was<00:00:34.200> actually<00:00:34.710> released<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.309> europe

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
version was actually released in europe

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.000 
version was actually released in europe
which<00:00:36.210> very<00:00:36.510> few<00:00:36.600> people<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.230> they

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
which very few people know about they

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
which very few people know about they
actually<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> japanese

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually think it was just a japanese

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.130 
actually think it was just a japanese
exclusive<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:42.210> west<00:00:42.420> never<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.960> got

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
exclusive and the west never really got

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.520 
exclusive and the west never really got
one<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.040> did<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.789> europe<00:00:45.149> anyways<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one but we did in europe anyways so this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.060 
one but we did in europe anyways so this
one<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.520> hard<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> find<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> box<00:00:49.770> version

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
one is very hard to find the box version

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.000 
one is very hard to find the box version
i<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.449> mario<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.710> have

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
i think there's only mario i don't have

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
i think there's only mario i don't have
confirmation<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.030> ever<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> Luigi

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
confirmation if there ever was a Luigi

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
confirmation if there ever was a Luigi
or<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.860> Wario<00:00:56.219> controller<00:00:56.840> I'll<00:00:57.840> open<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> up

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
or the Wario controller I'll open it up

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
or the Wario controller I'll open it up
in<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> minute<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.609> says<00:00:59.789> Mario

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
let's open it up and the controller in

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.520 
let's open it up and the controller in
it<00:01:19.140> isn't<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.740> packaged<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.369> much<00:01:20.670> but

controller comes in this little baggie

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
controller comes in this little baggie
as<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> brand-new<00:01:39.329> controllers<00:01:39.810> do

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
different variation that I found I did

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.060 
different variation that I found I did

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
wanted I think 250 dollars for it and I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.910 
wanted I think 250 dollars for it and I
just<00:01:58.890> said<00:01:59.280> no<00:01:59.460> that's<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.850> too<00:02:00.090> much<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.479> me

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
just said no that's just too much for me

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
just said no that's just too much for me
normally<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.399> has<00:02:02.700> been<00:02:02.939> recently

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
normally this one has been recently

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.350 
normally this one has been recently
selling<00:02:03.960> without<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.920> box<00:02:05.130> maybe<00:02:05.399> $80<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
selling without the box maybe $80 and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
selling without the box maybe $80 and
with<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> box<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.770> currently<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.550> at

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
with the box I think currently it's at

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.380 
with the box I think currently it's at
like<00:02:08.879> 100<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.899> 130<00:02:10.349> dollars<00:02:11.150> mine<00:02:12.150> has<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
like 100 to 130 dollars mine has a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.170 
like 100 to 130 dollars mine has a
little<00:02:12.660> bit<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> damage

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
little bit of damage

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.699 
little bit of damage
to<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.659> cool<00:02:13.840> part<00:02:14.049> about<00:02:14.079> this<00:02:14.290> box<00:02:14.500> is

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
to it the cool part about this box is

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.319 
to it the cool part about this box is
the<00:02:14.859> gene<00:02:15.069> side<00:02:15.489> but<00:02:15.790> take<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> look<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
the gene side but take a look at the

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.259 
the gene side but take a look at the
other<00:02:16.420> video<00:02:16.659> for<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.700> though<00:02:18.939> the

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
other video for that this one though the

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.179 
other video for that this one though the
price<00:02:19.510> could<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.290> over<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.769> place<00:02:20.980> it

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
price could be all over the place it

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.309 
price could be all over the place it
could<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.340> whatever<00:02:21.609> I<00:02:22.060> eventually<00:02:22.629> got<00:02:23.019> this

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
could be whatever I eventually got this

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.780 
could be whatever I eventually got this
one<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.799> I<00:02:23.890> think<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.099> few<00:02:24.219> other<00:02:24.400> controllers

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
one and I think a few other controllers

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.729 
one and I think a few other controllers
but<00:02:24.909> basically<00:02:25.359> I<00:02:25.390> bought<00:02:25.569> this<00:02:25.719> one<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.019> $100

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
but basically I bought this one for $100

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.289 
but basically I bought this one for $100
which<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.040> thought<00:02:27.189> was<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.400> very<00:02:27.549> fair<00:02:28.000> amount

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
which I thought was a very fair amount

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.149 
which I thought was a very fair amount
even<00:02:29.230> though<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.349> already<00:02:29.530> had<00:02:29.829> it

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
even though I already had it

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.490 
even though I already had it
I'm<00:02:30.849> not<00:02:31.180> crazy<00:02:31.569> into<00:02:32.019> collecting<00:02:32.379> different

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
I'm not crazy into collecting different

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800 
I'm not crazy into collecting different
box<00:02:32.799> variations<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.819> have<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
box variations but to have the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.089 
box variations but to have the
controller<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.500> thought<00:02:35.799> was<00:02:35.980> only

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
controller that I thought was only

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.490 
controller that I thought was only
released<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.579> Japan<00:02:36.639> and<00:02:37.239> have<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.870> European

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
released in Japan and have the European

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.289 
released in Japan and have the European
English<00:02:38.950> version<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> it<00:02:39.579> it's<00:02:40.000> kind<00:02:40.239> of

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
English version of it it's kind of

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.849 
English version of it it's kind of
really<00:02:40.450> cool<00:02:40.689> the<00:02:41.260> controllers<00:02:41.650> are<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
really cool the controllers are the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.619 
really cool the controllers are the
exact<00:02:42.129> same<00:02:42.370> there's<00:02:43.030> no<00:02:43.239> difference<00:02:43.540> between

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
exact same there's no difference between

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.280 
exact same there's no difference between
the<00:02:43.900> two<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.980> colors<00:02:45.280> are<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.669> same<00:02:46.290> there's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
the two the colors are the same there's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.659 
the two the colors are the same there's
not<00:02:47.500> much<00:02:47.680> else<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.889> compare<00:02:48.220> between<00:02:48.370> them

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
not much else to compare between them
