00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.400 
questions the reason I'm not online very
much<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.210> because<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:44.600> don't<00:03:44.780> play<00:03:44.930> goers<00:03:45.140> that

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.400 
much is because I don't play goers that
much<00:03:45.790> another<00:03:46.790> reason<00:03:47.450> maybe<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:48.110> because

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
much another reason maybe is because

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.220 
much another reason maybe is because
when<00:03:48.680> i'm<00:03:48.770> online<00:03:49.010> you're<00:03:49.850> not<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.230> but
