net down was taking his helmet off

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.630 
net down was taking his helmet off
amazing<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.470> think<00:01:32.740> he<00:01:32.860> got<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> back<00:01:33.460> of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
amazing I think he got in the back of

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.940 
amazing I think he got in the back of
Nelson<00:01:33.940> Piquet<00:01:34.090> Jr<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.780> when<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.380> did<00:01:35.650> when<00:01:35.890> he

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when he

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.160 
Nelson Piquet Jr and when it did when he
did<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.490> slowed<00:01:37.030> his<00:01:37.240> momentum<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:37.990> that's

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
did that slowed his momentum and that's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.990 
did that slowed his momentum and that's
I<00:01:38.290> think<00:01:38.320> james<00:01:38.770> Buescher<00:01:39.190> got<00:01:39.580> into<00:01:39.880> him

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
I think james Buescher got into him

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.050 
I think james Buescher got into him

if those trucks macondo BK got sideways

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.969 
if those trucks macondo BK got sideways
and<00:01:52.870> then<00:01:52.990> all<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.229> sudden<00:01:53.260> Pluto<00:01:53.800> gets

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
and then all of a sudden Pluto gets

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.920 
and then all of a sudden Pluto gets
sideways<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.610> these<00:01:54.729> trucks<00:01:55.000> handle<00:01:55.420> well

sideways and these trucks handle well

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.320 
sideways and these trucks handle well
enough<00:01:56.260> it's<00:01:56.500> hard<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.190> understand<00:01:57.580> how<00:01:57.790> this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
enough it's hard to understand how this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.760 
enough it's hard to understand how this
