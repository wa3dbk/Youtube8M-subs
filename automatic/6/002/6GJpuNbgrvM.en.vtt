00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
bushings as you can see you can just

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.279 
bushings as you can see you can just
change<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.609> really<00:00:59.730> quickly

back<00:01:31.049> together<00:01:31.880> form<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
back together form like this kind of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.950 
back together form like this kind of
flush<00:01:34.250> smooth<00:01:35.250> transition<00:01:35.939> between<00:01:35.970> both<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
flush smooth transition between both of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
flush smooth transition between both of
all<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> companies<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.369> making

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
all the companies that are making

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
all the companies that are making
bindings<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.150> believe<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> only

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bindings I believe that now is the only

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
bindings I believe that now is the only
one<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.549> making<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.150> flush<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
one that's making this flush kind of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.190 
one that's making this flush kind of
like<00:01:43.170> heel<00:01:43.530> cup<00:01:43.829> style<00:01:44.540> binding<00:01:45.540> what's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
like heel cup style binding what's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
like heel cup style binding what's
really<00:01:46.590> cool<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.220> asymmetrical<00:01:47.880> high

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really cool about this asymmetrical high

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
really cool about this asymmetrical high
back<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> has<00:01:49.020> tools<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.560> its<00:01:49.860> forward

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
back well it has tools to its forward

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
back well it has tools to its forward
lean<00:01:50.189> adjustment<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.509> little

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
lean adjustment it's kind of a little

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.800 
lean adjustment it's kind of a little
bit<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.259> asymmetrical<00:01:52.770> than<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> normal<00:01:54.090> high

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bit more asymmetrical than a normal high

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.510 
bit more asymmetrical than a normal high
back<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.159> lateral

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
