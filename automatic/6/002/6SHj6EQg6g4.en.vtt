00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 the fall in the value of ipva tax on 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 ownership of motor vehicles 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.980
 happened for an obvious reason 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.559
 the used cars are cheaper with 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 the reduction of ipi the vehicles lost in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.779
 average 20% of the value 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.390
 already the tax was reduced by 11 per 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.240
 cent in the state of mines is very good, right? 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 because by that time the final whistle 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 year things much while erasing is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 always good and reduction of taxes 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.980
 there with them for them or anything at all 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.079
 bottom at low 1 under other equal 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 the devaluation of the most 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 old ne 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 but to lower these prices I did not find 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.110
 very good but is it true and not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 Nothing, nothing. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.920
 the rate is then that attacked I think it's good 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.059
 huh 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 especially those who have more than one 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.570
 vehicle can still keep 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 help but the economy could be 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.630
 higher if the licensing fee does not 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 had increased by 7% going from sixty 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.939
 and six reais and thirty-two cents 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.119
 to 71 and 30 for this year the expectation 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.090
 of government is raising more than 3 billion 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.479
 of all the value collected with ipva 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 40% are in the municipality where the vehicle 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 another 40% went to the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.610
 state and 20% for the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.509
 development of basic education. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 fundeb 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.119
 the great advantage is also repeated in this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.900
 year the population can already pay ipva 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.329
 this month of December taking advantage of 13th 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.450
 not struggling at the beginning of the next 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.180
 Whoever has a really put car will go 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 there take your table see how much it goes 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.009
 stay because you just have to go into the office 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.860
 the state of Minas Gerais that has the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.590
 fipe the value of the car has a 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.659
 manual zinho explaining so step to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 step, how can he calculate the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.350
 Your ipva that is very simple is not for 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.050
 who has a clear computer and who does not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.489
 have to look for a dispatcher that he can 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.620
 do this too 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.390
 and see really know 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.940
 put how much will these three 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.989
 benefits and how much will it 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.720
 is to spend less paying now who is 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.120
 with money in the account stopped can do 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.180
 a good deal and save money by 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.610
 discount view 3% and for all 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.860
 December plus a 3% cash discount 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.579
 which is very good for those with 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.549
 money right there instead of piecemeal and 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.769
 money he'll get with it and the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.170
 that we call the itamar rate is not 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.170
 will also be a larger collection
