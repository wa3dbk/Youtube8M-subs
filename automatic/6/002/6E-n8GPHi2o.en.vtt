 battle against many more villains for 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.040
 get to the tuna defeat but this does not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.539
 it's all but the appearance of 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
 galactus will make more interesting the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.149
 history without a doubt one of the best 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.149
 games that I could have played 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.860
 more reverse scan with classic series of 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.299
 classic marvel see their faces with 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.280
 represents one of the games that we 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.019
 will go back our great childhood from the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 1 to the last ultimate marvel vs 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.920
 capcom 3 these games represented 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.019
 many hours of fun and at the same time 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.700
 a lot of frustration to beat the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.980
 senior boss who would be galactose and 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.910
 Personally exceeded the best game 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.910
 for me for the work 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.200
 batman arkham series if the games of 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.000
 batman who had left before for the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 sixth generation consoles seemed like 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.180
 great they would be arkham came to 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.830
 revolutionize the game that batman already 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.300
 represented the history of arkham 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.250
 asylum commits batman in one day 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.530
 normal work capturing the joker 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.209
 taking her to the arkham asylum where 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.799
 develops the game completely the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.540
 joker would have naturally tended a 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.549
 trap and take control of the asylum 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 putting batman in situations that 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.819
 only he could solve while in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.739
 the house and we can see batman 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.480
 facing the joker in the city a 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.190
 excellent game mode and handling 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.890
 history puts in this series in our 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.329
 today's video as game data 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.190
 batman arkham origins is not 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.260
 considered within this series without 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.940
 However, one of the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.190
 reasons is that the latter is not 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.170
 developed by rocksteady and was dedicated 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.170
 to develop batman arkham series 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.170
 do not 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.940
