I<00:00:51.199> basically<00:00:51.979> laminated<00:00:52.970> two<00:00:53.089> pieces<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.449> AC

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
I basically laminated two pieces of AC

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.649 
I basically laminated two pieces of AC
plywood<00:00:54.320> together<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:55.129> make<00:00:55.280> my<00:00:55.430> top<00:00:55.760> rack

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
plywood together to make my top rack

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.450 
plywood together to make my top rack
which<00:00:57.019> is<00:00:57.170> an<00:00:57.290> inch<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.710> half<00:00:57.739> thick<00:00:57.920> and

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
which is an inch and a half thick and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.329 
which is an inch and a half thick and
then<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.449> just<00:00:59.690> laid<00:01:00.140> out<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.589> rack<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.010> how<00:01:01.309> I

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
then I just laid out the rack and how I

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.399 
then I just laid out the rack and how I
did<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:01.940> used<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.239> combination<00:01:02.540> square<00:01:03.080> which

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
did is I used a combination square which

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.649 
did is I used a combination square which
is<00:01:03.559> one<00:01:03.799> inches<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:04.430> inch<00:01:04.580> wide<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.030> I

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
is one inches one inch wide and I

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.450 
is one inches one inch wide and I
started<00:01:06.080> with<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.290> spacing<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:07.190> I<00:01:07.250> laid

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
started with a spacing and then I laid

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.780 
started with a spacing and then I laid
out<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.670> one<00:01:08.090> inch<00:01:08.270> slot<00:01:08.990> pipe<00:01:09.470> slot<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:10.010> found

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
out a one inch slot pipe slot I found

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.969 
out a one inch slot pipe slot I found
out<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.570> one<00:01:11.780> inch<00:01:11.990> was<00:01:12.260> too<00:01:12.619> tight<00:01:12.950> for

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
out that the one inch was too tight for

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.980 
out that the one inch was too tight for
a<00:01:13.190> three<00:01:13.400> quarter<00:01:13.700> pipe<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.510> I<00:01:14.540> ended<00:01:14.720> up<00:01:14.810> going

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
a three quarter pipe so I ended up going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.290 
a three quarter pipe so I ended up going
with<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.440> little<00:01:15.650> little<00:01:16.160> bit<00:01:16.280> wider<00:01:16.550> on<00:01:16.880> my

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
with a little little bit wider on my

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.570 
with a little little bit wider on my
cuts<00:01:17.600> on<00:01:17.990> either<00:01:18.350> side<00:01:18.680> of<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.860> pencil<00:01:19.070> line<00:01:19.340> I

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
cuts on either side of the pencil line I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.890 
cuts on either side of the pencil line I
came<00:01:19.880> up<00:01:20.000> with<00:01:20.030> like<00:01:20.330> an<00:01:20.450> inch<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.690> an<00:01:20.810> eighth

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
came up with like an inch and an eighth

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.530 
came up with like an inch and an eighth
to<00:01:21.020> an<00:01:21.110> inch<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.410> quarter<00:01:21.620> slot<00:01:22.430> wide<00:01:23.090> slot

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
to an inch and a quarter slot wide slot

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.800 
to an inch and a quarter slot wide slot
two<00:01:24.410> and<00:01:24.620> three<00:01:24.890> quarters<00:01:25.400> deep<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.450> did<00:01:26.690> an

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
two and three quarters deep so I did an

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.190 
two and three quarters deep so I did an
interfacing<00:01:27.470> slot<00:01:28.370> in<00:01:28.640> spacing<00:01:29.360> slot<00:01:29.690> all<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
interfacing slot in spacing slot all the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.160 
interfacing slot in spacing slot all the
way<00:01:30.290> down<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.830> end<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.400> rack<00:01:32.170> ending

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
way down to the end of the rack ending

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.220 
way down to the end of the rack ending
with<00:01:33.350> an<00:01:33.470> inch<00:01:33.710> space<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.340> then<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.880> cut<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:35.450> two

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
with an inch space and then I cut to two

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.250 
with an inch space and then I cut to two
lengths<00:01:36.440> ended<00:01:37.190> up<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:37.400> 41<00:01:37.850> inches<00:01:38.090> long<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
lengths ended up with 41 inches long the

lengths ended up with 41 inches long the
two<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> three-quarter<00:01:40.460> inch<00:01:40.640> deep<00:01:40.910> slot<00:01:41.330> I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
two and three-quarter inch deep slot I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.410 
two and three-quarter inch deep slot I
found<00:01:42.140> was<00:01:42.380> plenty<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.160> hold<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.550> pipe<00:01:44.090> clamp

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
found was plenty to hold the pipe clamp

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.470 
found was plenty to hold the pipe clamp
securely<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.200> safely<00:01:45.260> in<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.070> rack<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.610> used<00:01:47.360> a

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
securely and safely in the rack I used a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.140 
securely and safely in the rack I used a
Forstner<00:01:47.960> bit<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.440> make<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.070> circle<00:01:49.580> part<00:01:49.910> of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
Forstner bit to make the circle part of

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.780 
Forstner bit to make the circle part of
the<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.780> back<00:01:51.020> portion<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.710> slot<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.370> I

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
the the back portion of the slot and I

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.149

basically<00:01:53.030> drilled<00:01:53.690> holes<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.590> way<00:01:54.830> down

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
basically drilled holes all the way down

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.830 
basically drilled holes all the way down
using<00:01:55.430> my<00:01:55.550> combination<00:01:55.909> square<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.690> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
using my combination square and the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
center point of the Forstner bit to lay

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.960 
center point of the Forstner bit to lay
it<00:01:59.210> out<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.890> I'd<00:02:00.890> roll<00:02:01.100> all<00:02:01.310> those<00:02:01.460> holes<00:02:01.730> and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
it out and I'd roll all those holes and

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.350 
it out and I'd roll all those holes and
I<00:02:02.390> cut<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.900> slots<00:02:03.230> out<00:02:03.500> with<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> miter<00:02:04.460> saw<00:02:04.550> you

I cut the slots out with a miter saw you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.990 
I cut the slots out with a miter saw you
could<00:02:05.540> use<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.690> handsaw<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.590> jig<00:02:07.159> saw<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.430> band<00:02:07.790> a

could use a handsaw a jig saw a band a
bandsaw<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.840> matter<00:02:09.019> doesn't<00:02:09.649> matter

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
bandsaw for that matter doesn't matter

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.460 
bandsaw for that matter doesn't matter
you<00:02:10.459> got<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.700> cut<00:02:10.849> those<00:02:11.000> out<00:02:11.209> cut<00:02:11.989> myself<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
you got to cut those out cut myself to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.890 
you got to cut those out cut myself to
length<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.860> made<00:02:13.550> myself<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:14.060> six<00:02:14.360> inch<00:02:14.629> deep

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900

backer board screwed down into that and

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.830 
backer board screwed down into that and
then<00:02:18.859> I<00:02:18.950> finished<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.489> end<00:02:19.760> caps<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
then I finished with end caps and the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.259 
then I finished with end caps and the
end<00:02:21.019> caps<00:02:21.319> hold<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.920> l-shape<00:02:22.489> all<00:02:22.700> together

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
45 degree angle on it one because it

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.420 
45 degree angle on it one because it
looked<00:02:28.519> nicer<00:02:28.939> and<00:02:29.090> two<00:02:29.659> I<00:02:30.620> was<00:02:30.980> thinking<00:02:31.310> when

looked nicer and two I was thinking when

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.490 
looked nicer and two I was thinking when
you<00:02:31.519> put<00:02:31.700> those<00:02:31.819> two<00:02:32.120> end<00:02:32.390> clamps<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.409> you

you put those two end clamps and you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140 
you put those two end clamps and you
wouldn't<00:02:33.769> scrape<00:02:33.980> your<00:02:34.129> knuckles<00:02:34.519> as<00:02:34.760> easy<00:02:34.970> if

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
can never have enough clamps so having

pipe clamp racks where lots of pipe
clamps<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> helpful<00:02:52.340> with<00:02:52.519> all<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.790> projects
