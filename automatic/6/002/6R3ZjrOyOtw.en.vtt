disease into the main category of the
tree<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> other<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.859> noticed<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
tree now the other thing I noticed is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
tree now the other thing I noticed is
quite<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> citrus<00:00:33.239> leaf<00:00:33.600> miner

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
quite a lot of citrus leaf miner

quite a lot of citrus leaf miner
it's<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.710> curling<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.340> those<00:00:35.550> leaves<00:00:35.820> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it's really curling up those leaves it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's really curling up those leaves it's
sometimes<00:00:36.600> known<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.870> leaf<00:00:37.469> curl<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.950> citrus

sometimes known as leaf curl of citrus

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
sometimes known as leaf curl of citrus
but<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.480> idea<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> rid<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.469> those

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but it's a good idea to get rid of those

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
but it's a good idea to get rid of those
infected<00:00:41.579> leaves<00:00:41.730> now<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.300> put<00:00:42.450> them<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
infected leaves now and put them in the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.029 
infected leaves now and put them in the
bin<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> compost<00:00:45.230> there's<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:46.440> some
