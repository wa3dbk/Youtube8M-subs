bigger brother so let's go through some

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.969 
bigger brother so let's go through some
of<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.310> features<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> pedal<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of the features here on the pedal you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.150 
of the features here on the pedal you
get<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.580> classic<00:01:12.390> planting<00:01:13.140> controls<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
get the classic planting controls you

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.249 
get the classic planting controls you
get<00:01:14.340> speed<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.940> get<00:01:15.060> depth<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.660> get

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
get speed you get depth and you get

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
get speed you get depth and you get
feedback<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.040> allows<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
feedback and that allows you to get a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
feedback and that allows you to get a
ton<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.479> different<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.410> really<00:01:19.590> cool

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
ton of different really really cool

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:40.600 
ton of different really really cool
tones<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.190> let's<00:01:20.340> check<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.970> out

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.749 

so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> wealth<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> different<00:01:43.759> wealth

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so you get a wealth of different wealth

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
so you get a wealth of different wealth
of<00:01:44.880> different<00:01:45.210> tones<00:01:45.390> from<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> petal<00:01:46.140> itself

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
of different tones from the petal itself

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
of different tones from the petal itself
but<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.570> called

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
but we have something really cool called

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.660 
but we have something really cool called
thumbprint<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.310> allows<00:01:50.550> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thumbprint and that actually allows you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
thumbprint and that actually allows you
to<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:50.940> even<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.659> great<00:01:52.020> sounds<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to get even more great sounds out of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.090 
to get even more great sounds out of
this<00:01:52.979> amazing<00:01:53.940> pedal<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.049> over<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.830> on<00:01:56.040> my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
this amazing pedal so over here on my

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
this amazing pedal so over here on my
computer<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.940> have<00:01:57.090> something<00:01:57.659> called<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
computer I have something called the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
computer I have something called the
thumbprint<00:01:58.350> editor<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.640> allows<00:01:59.909> me<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
thumbprint editor and this allows me to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
thumbprint editor and this allows me to
change<00:02:00.509> between<00:02:00.720> different<00:02:01.440> sounds<00:02:02.429> that<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
change between different sounds that you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.240 
change between different sounds that you
can<00:02:02.880> actually<00:02:03.030> either<00:02:03.869> dial<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.500> yourself<00:02:04.979> or

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
can actually either dial in yourself or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.240 
can actually either dial in yourself or
you<00:02:05.940> can<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.170> load<00:02:07.440> some<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.830> sounds

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you can you can load some of the sounds

dri catarse can go passes straight

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.500 
dri catarse can go passes straight
through<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:52.040> pedal<00:02:52.310> unaltered<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.090> this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
through the pedal unaltered and this

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.630 
through the pedal unaltered and this
means<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.410> get<00:02:54.590> absolutely<00:02:55.070> several

so<00:02:57.770> even<00:02:58.490> when<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> pedal<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.330> your<00:02:59.900> drag

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
so even when the pedal is on your drag

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.380 
so even when the pedal is on your drag
it<00:03:00.380> has<00:03:00.590> signal<00:03:01.370> which<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.730> really<00:03:01.970> important

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
it has signal which is really important

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.900 
it has signal which is really important
it<00:03:02.510> remains<00:03:02.840> intact<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.220> vortex<00:03:04.460> mini

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
it remains intact so this is vortex mini

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.910 
it remains intact so this is vortex mini
