00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.380
 disciplines in the inspection of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 cover 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 that does not look good anymore 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.640

 cartridges pistol different pullers 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 Silicone Remover Mold Remover 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 Sanitary silicone dishwashing liquid with a

 cup for kitchen paper and a game 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.260
 cloth then we are curious how he 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 The old fugue has to get out of it 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.750
 He makes the caution here with the cutter 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.570
 blade should always be sharp 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.239
 and do not get out of the way otherwise 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 breaks them quickly and as always brings 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.789
 our patience for decent 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 work with until the fugue really free 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.189
 is who likes it a little more comfortable 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.430
 to grow a joint hey too 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.130
 The knife cuts both flanks 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.320
 at the same time remains always and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 therefore, our professional removes them thoroughly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.650
 with silicone remover with the brush 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.619
 apply and leave donations 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 if it is silicone mold 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.150
 has the joints after that in addition 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
 still with a mildew remover 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.759
 be edited around the mold spores 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.600
 important to kill then the fugue well 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.210
 dry 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 Now he is preparing a silicone cartouche 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.979
 for the new fuge before first the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
 then cut off the spout 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.890
 screw the cartridge open now 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.649
 in the pistol a right and to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.530
 finish the covers at an angle and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.610
 then cut to the width of a joint, then 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.579
 Ready to go 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.000
 he starts in the corner at first vertical 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.330
 fuge from the cross point up then to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.690
 the pages 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.720
 It looks like the final one 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.740
 now comes the suds is already 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.200
 prepared 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.560
 he entered the puller and catches 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.140
 again with the vertical fugue on 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.940
 that looks really great with 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.850
 a good educator can also 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.150
 beginner clean work that saves the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.130
 Mask the joints with adhesive tapes as 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.470
 edge limitation is also the danger 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.110
 that the joints edges when pulling off 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.210
 become porous there have dirt and 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.190
 moisture quickly becomes light again 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.750
 game 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.420
 in between the puller from the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.330
 Clean the silicone and clean it again 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.450
 the suds wash already works 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.040
 he continued on the horizontal fugue and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.130
 was that it? 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.980
 no, a bit of subtle work is also 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.580
 still necessary he scratches the silicone leftovers 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.670
 clean out of the tile joints 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.890
 Perfectly important, the silicone must 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.100
 dry at least twelve hours before 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.050
 it may be wet again that was it 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.510
 even from the shower love 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.510
