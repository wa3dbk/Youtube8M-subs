an X DX fifty octopus as well cause it's

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.789 
an X DX fifty octopus as well cause it's
a<00:00:11.910> much<00:00:12.059> more<00:00:12.210> affordable<00:00:12.360> way<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.500> into

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
a much more affordable way to get into

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.550 
a much more affordable way to get into
apex<00:00:14.130> regulators<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.940> also<00:00:15.179> they're<00:00:15.560> pretty

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
apex regulators and also they're pretty

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
apex regulators and also they're pretty
much<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.150> specification<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.270> cold<00:00:18.480> water

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
much the specification for cold water

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.340 
much the specification for cold water
regulators<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> package<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
regulators so in the package you have a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
regulators so in the package you have a
DST<00:00:25.350> first<00:00:25.650> stage<00:00:25.920> which<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> again<00:00:27.060> cold

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
well so you get the same performance at

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.959 
well so you get the same performance at
any<00:00:35.730> depth<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.840> ended<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> pressure

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969

it doesn't get in a way of anything I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
it doesn't get in a way of anything I
can<00:01:19.770> obviously<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.130> fistly<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
can obviously be fistly the way up

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
can obviously be fistly the way up
depending<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.659> want<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> route<00:01:22.290> your

hoses regulators supplied with braided
hoses<00:01:27.630> both<00:01:27.990> hoses<00:01:28.290> obviously<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.640> primary

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
hoses both hoses obviously the primary

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.140 
hoses both hoses obviously the primary
one<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> shorter<00:01:30.900> black<00:01:31.380> hose<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.820> I'll<00:01:32.939> see

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
one is a shorter black hose and I'll see

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.190 
one is a shorter black hose and I'll see
the<00:01:33.890> octopus<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> slightly<00:01:35.670> longer<00:01:36.200> yellow

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the octopus is a slightly longer yellow

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
the octopus is a slightly longer yellow
colored<00:01:37.680> hose<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.430> visibility<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
colored hose just for visibility and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.460 
colored hose just for visibility and
also<00:01:39.420> gives<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.780> extra<00:01:40.020> reach<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.530> well

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
also gives you that extra reach as well

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
also gives you that extra reach as well
braided<00:01:43.470> hoses<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:44.100> safer<00:01:44.939> than<00:01:45.090> rubber

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
braided hoses are safer than rubber

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
braided hoses are safer than rubber
hoses<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.320> parish<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.340> rubber<00:01:47.700> ones<00:01:47.970> do

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
hoses don't parish like rubber ones do

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
hoses don't parish like rubber ones do
it<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.020> Sun<00:01:49.229> doesn't<00:01:49.439> deteriorate<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it so the Sun doesn't deteriorate and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
it so the Sun doesn't deteriorate and
the<00:01:50.850> salt<00:01:51.119> doesn't<00:01:51.329> deteriorate<00:01:51.570> them<00:01:52.200> they

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the salt doesn't deteriorate them they

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429 
the salt doesn't deteriorate them they
were<00:01:53.040> high<00:01:53.220> burst<00:01:53.610> pressure<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.720> flexible

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
were high burst pressure more flexible

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.830 
were high burst pressure more flexible
lighter<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> lot<00:01:56.430> more<00:01:56.460> advantages<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
lighter so a lot more advantages to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
lighter so a lot more advantages to
having<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> braided<00:01:58.530> hoses<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> rubber

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
having the braided hoses over the rubber

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
having the braided hoses over the rubber
which<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.850> obviously<00:02:00.090> why<00:02:00.270> apex<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.899> switched

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
which is obviously why apex I switched

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.990 
which is obviously why apex I switched
over<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.750> second<00:02:04.110> stages<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.909> pretty<00:02:05.909> much

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
over the second stages are pretty much

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.109 
over the second stages are pretty much
identical<00:02:06.149> both<00:02:06.840> being<00:02:07.110> xgx<00:02:07.890> 50s

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
identical both being xgx 50s

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.089 
identical both being xgx 50s
obviously<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.629> differences<00:02:11.050> are<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.920> yellow

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
obviously the differences are the yellow

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.690 
obviously the differences are the yellow
trim<00:02:12.519> for<00:02:13.349> visibility<00:02:14.349> purposes<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.550> got

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
trim for visibility purposes so you got

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.809 
trim for visibility purposes so you got
a<00:02:15.940> yellow<00:02:16.420> trim<00:02:16.780> front<00:02:17.080> cover<00:02:17.519> venturi<00:02:18.519> switch

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
to do shan't take very long so let's

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.699 
to do shan't take very long so let's
just<00:03:58.690> swap<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.870> round<00:03:59.200> make<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
just swap it round make the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.559 
just swap it round make the

back together and it's a left-handed on
this<00:04:05.380> side<00:04:05.560> we've<00:04:06.160> got<00:04:06.190> venturi<00:04:06.760> switch<00:04:07.079> so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
this side we've got venturi switch so

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.110 
this side we've got venturi switch so
that<00:04:08.109> just<00:04:08.380> controls<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:09.190> flow<00:04:09.669> of<00:04:09.790> air

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
that just controls the flow of air

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.539 
that just controls the flow of air

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
inside the second stage housing so you

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.800 
inside the second stage housing so you
either<00:04:12.639> have<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.880> going<00:04:13.209> direct<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.660> the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
either have it going direct to the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.500 
either have it going direct to the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
free-flowing

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.700 
free-flowing
also<00:04:21.940> got<00:04:22.090> inhalation<00:04:22.719> adjustment

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
also got inhalation adjustment

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.710 
also got inhalation adjustment
so<00:04:23.860> wound<00:04:24.430> all<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.699> way<00:04:24.850> out<00:04:25.030> was<00:04:25.210> optimal

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
so wound all the way out was optimal

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.529 
so wound all the way out was optimal
position<00:04:26.229> best<00:04:26.680> flow<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:27.430> was<00:04:28.030> getting<00:04:28.419> the

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
position best flow I was getting the

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.350

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
least breathing resistance as well if

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.450 
least breathing resistance as well if
you<00:04:31.539> start<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.289> wind<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.650> in<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.979> increase<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
you start to wind it in you increase the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.240 
you start to wind it in you increase the
tension<00:04:33.699> on<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.000> springs<00:04:34.479> inside<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.319> it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
tension on the springs inside and it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.830 
tension on the springs inside and it
makes<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> little<00:04:36.639> bit<00:04:36.970> harder<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
makes it a little bit harder to to

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.510 
makes it a little bit harder to to
breathe<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.169> have<00:04:38.319> to<00:04:38.410> suck<00:04:38.919> in<00:04:39.069> a<00:04:39.190> little<00:04:39.430> bit

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
breathe you have to suck in a little bit

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.820 
breathe you have to suck in a little bit
more<00:04:39.720> again<00:04:40.720> it's<00:04:40.900> there<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.650> can

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
more again it's there just so you can

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.920 
more again it's there just so you can
fine-tune<00:04:42.069> your<00:04:42.880> second<00:04:43.360> stage<00:04:43.569> it<00:04:43.810> also

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
fine-tune your second stage it also

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.960 
fine-tune your second stage it also
gives<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.289> bit<00:04:44.470> more<00:04:44.500> repetition<00:04:45.430> if<00:04:45.759> you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
gives you a bit more repetition if you

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.640 
gives you a bit more repetition if you
using<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:46.630> we've<00:04:46.930> done<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.169> one<00:04:47.319> especially

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
using a we've done that one especially

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.700 
using a we've done that one especially
for<00:04:47.889> the<00:04:48.130> octopus<00:04:49.139> which<00:04:50.139> obviously<00:04:50.349> has<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
for the octopus which obviously has the

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.710 
for the octopus which obviously has the
inhalation<00:04:51.039> adjustment<00:04:51.550> as<00:04:51.639> well<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:52.479> wine

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
inhalation adjustment as well can wine

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.270 
inhalation adjustment as well can wine
it<00:04:52.900> in<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.050> little<00:04:53.289> bit<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.830> make<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.130> that

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
it in a little bit and to make it that

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.730 
it in a little bit and to make it that
little<00:04:54.460> bit<00:04:54.580> harder<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> open<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.020> valve<00:04:56.229> so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
little bit harder to open the valve so

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.379 
little bit harder to open the valve so
if<00:04:56.800> you're<00:04:56.919> not<00:04:57.039> using<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.430> gives<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.210> bit<00:04:58.270> of

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
if you're not using it gives it a bit of

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.540 
if you're not using it gives it a bit of
a<00:04:58.449> fail-safe<00:04:58.830> but<00:04:59.830> obviously<00:05:00.039> when<00:05:00.190> it's<00:05:00.340> not

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
a fail-safe but obviously when it's not

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.969 
a fail-safe but obviously when it's not
in<00:05:00.759> use<00:05:00.789> it<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:01.750> best<00:05:02.139> practice<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.860> it

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
in use it is best practice to have it

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.170 
in use it is best practice to have it
round<00:05:03.160> out<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:03.759> it<00:05:03.970> doesn't

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
round out because it doesn't

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.029 
round out because it doesn't
artificially<00:05:05.169> reshape<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.070> spring<00:05:08.039> so

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
artificially reshape the spring so

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.339 
artificially reshape the spring so
overall<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.729> nice<00:05:09.940> compact<00:05:10.780> size<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.289> the

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
overall a nice compact size of the

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.719 
overall a nice compact size of the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
doesn't give you your fatigue if used

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.089 
doesn't give you your fatigue if used

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
across the top of the mouthpiece they're

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.100 
across the top of the mouthpiece they're
basically<00:05:28.150> just<00:05:28.270> sits<00:05:28.509> at<00:05:28.659> the<00:05:28.720> top<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:29.050> the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
basically just sits at the top of the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.219 
basically just sits at the top of the
palate<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:30.729> air<00:05:30.940> comes<00:05:31.389> in<00:05:31.630> through<00:05:31.840> the

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
palate and the air comes in through the

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.230 
palate and the air comes in through the
mouthpiece<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.979> his<00:05:33.310> past<00:05:33.610> is<00:05:33.849> underneath

this<00:05:34.419> little<00:05:34.690> bridge<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.229> just<00:05:35.590> helps

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
this little bridge and just helps

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.649 
this little bridge and just helps
prevent<00:05:36.190> your<00:05:36.280> mouth<00:05:36.669> from<00:05:36.940> drawing<00:05:37.270> out<00:05:37.479> too

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
prevent your mouth from drawing out too
