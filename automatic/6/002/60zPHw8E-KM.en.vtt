raids<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.789> my<00:01:00.030> life<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.379> CC<00:01:01.739> comes

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
raids of my life so here the CC comes

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
raids of my life so here the CC comes
out<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.699> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> split<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
out and they kind of split one which is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
out and they kind of split one which is
on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> left<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:05.159> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
on the left one which is on the right so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
on the left one which is on the right so
I<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> poison<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.229> side<00:01:07.500> there

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
I put the poison on the right side there

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
I put the poison on the right side there
because<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> wizard<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.520> also<00:01:08.850> i

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
because there's a wizard there also i

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
because there's a wizard there also i
think<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> good<00:01:10.229> choice<00:01:10.470> cuz<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
think that was a good choice cuz the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
think that was a good choice cuz the
witch<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> core<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.659> gonna<00:01:12.840> suck<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.170> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
witch in the core was gonna suck in my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.340 
witch in the core was gonna suck in my
troops<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> core<00:01:14.130> anyways<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.200> at<00:01:16.200> this
