today's<00:00:16.910> tutorial<00:00:17.210> is<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:18.080> show<00:00:18.410> you<00:00:18.470> how<00:00:18.860> to

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
today's tutorial is to show you how to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.790 
today's tutorial is to show you how to
test<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.850> power<00:00:20.060> supply<00:00:20.420> without<00:00:20.930> using<00:00:21.619> a

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
test the power supply without using a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.200 
test the power supply without using a
standard<00:00:22.310> power<00:00:23.119> supply<00:00:23.660> tester<00:00:24.700> in<00:00:25.700> normal

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
standard power supply tester in normal

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.810 
standard power supply tester in normal
situations<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.740> would<00:00:27.890> use<00:00:28.130> something<00:00:28.279> like

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
situations you would use something like

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.800 
situations you would use something like
this<00:00:29.000> an<00:00:29.380> ATX<00:00:30.380> power<00:00:30.860> supply<00:00:31.250> tester<00:00:31.689> but<00:00:32.689> the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
this an ATX power supply tester but the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.270 
this an ATX power supply tester but the
fact<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.350> you're<00:00:33.649> looking<00:00:33.920> at<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.100> video

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
fact that you're looking at this video

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.010 
fact that you're looking at this video
means<00:00:35.210> you<00:00:35.690> don't<00:00:35.870> have<00:00:35.989> one<00:00:36.320> okay<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:38.720> only

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
means you don't have one okay the only

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.520 
means you don't have one okay the only
tool<00:00:39.260> required<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:41.540> paperclip

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.689 

now<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.770> paperclip<00:00:46.190> needs<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.000> be<00:00:47.149> bent<00:00:48.699> into

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
now this paperclip needs to be bent into

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.290 
now this paperclip needs to be bent into
a<00:00:49.730> shape<00:00:50.030> like<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:52.960> once<00:00:53.960> you've<00:00:54.140> done<00:00:54.260> that

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
a shape like that once you've done that

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.180 
a shape like that once you've done that
you<00:00:56.300> need<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.929> put<00:00:57.109> some<00:00:57.289> load<00:00:57.559> on<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.980> power

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you need to put some load on the power

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.099 
you need to put some load on the power
supply<00:00:58.609> this<00:00:59.329> is<00:00:59.539> done<00:00:59.780> by<00:01:00.530> using<00:01:00.559> hard<00:01:01.550> drive

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
supply this is done by using hard drive

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.710 
supply this is done by using hard drive
cd-rom<00:01:03.430> plug<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.580> molex<00:01:04.910> into<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.510> back<00:01:05.630> of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
cd-rom plug the molex into the back of

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.670 
cd-rom plug the molex into the back of
the<00:01:05.810> hard<00:01:05.930> drive<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.630> then<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.409> power

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the hard drive like so then the power

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.660 
the hard drive like so then the power
supply<00:01:10.040> needs<00:01:10.610> power<00:01:12.220> power<00:01:13.220> lead<00:01:13.430> from<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
supply needs power power lead from the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.380 
supply needs power power lead from the
mains<00:01:14.200> plugged<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:17.439> take<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.770> 20<00:01:19.189> or<00:01:19.399> 24<00:01:20.090> pin

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
mains plugged in take the 20 or 24 pin

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.240 
mains plugged in take the 20 or 24 pin
motherboard<00:01:21.100> ATX<00:01:22.100> connector<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.880> look<00:01:23.720> for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
motherboard ATX connector and look for

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.480 
motherboard ATX connector and look for
the<00:01:25.250> green<00:01:25.670> wire<00:01:26.060> there<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.990> if<00:01:27.649> either<00:01:28.070> of

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
the green wire there and if either of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.889 
the green wire there and if either of
the<00:01:28.729> black<00:01:28.970> ones<00:01:29.240> either<00:01:29.600> side<00:01:31.329> take<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.540> bent

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
the black ones either side take the bent

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.459 
the black ones either side take the bent
paperclip<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.420> push<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.600> onto<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.590> pins<00:01:38.469> so

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
paperclip and push it onto the pins so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.859 
paperclip and push it onto the pins so
you<00:01:39.530> cross<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.360> green<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.860> black<00:01:43.100> wire

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
you cross the green and the black wire

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.380 
you cross the green and the black wire
like<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:47.110> now<00:01:48.110> as<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.469> can<00:01:48.619> see<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:50.149> power

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
like so now as you can see the power

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.700 
like so now as you can see the power
supply<00:01:50.810> has<00:01:51.110> now<00:01:51.920> powered<00:01:52.640> up<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:54.320> panel

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
supply has now powered up this panel

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.319 
supply has now powered up this panel
supply<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.570> working<00:01:56.570> fine<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:58.549> can<00:01:58.850> use<00:01:59.149> this

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
supply is working fine you can use this

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.039 
supply is working fine you can use this
method<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.100> make<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.250> power<00:02:01.579> supply<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:02.240> bench

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
method to make a power supply a bench

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.770 
method to make a power supply a bench
tester<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.369> test<00:02:04.640> pieces<00:02:05.450> of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
tester so you can test pieces of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.350 
tester so you can test pieces of
computer<00:02:05.930> equipment<00:02:06.789> without<00:02:07.789> using<00:02:08.300> a

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
computer equipment without using a

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.700 
computer equipment without using a
motherboard<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.860> computer<00:02:11.320> if<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.500> take

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
motherboard and a computer if you take

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.450 
motherboard and a computer if you take
this<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:13.270> make<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.300> more<00:02:14.480> secure<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.770> will<00:02:16.250> last

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
this up make it more secure it will last

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.120 
this up make it more secure it will last
for<00:02:16.970> ages
