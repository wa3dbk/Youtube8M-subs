some<00:00:43.590> hard<00:00:43.800> core<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:45.360> completed<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.079> base

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
some hard core I then completed the base

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.369 
some hard core I then completed the base
with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> ballast<00:00:47.129> cement<00:00:47.520> mixture<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
with a ballast cement mixture and that

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.910 
with a ballast cement mixture and that
became<00:00:49.379> my<00:00:49.620> base<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.180> added<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.199> further

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
became my base I then added a further

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160 
became my base I then added a further
two<00:00:53.309> courses<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.180> blocks<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.780> bring<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
two courses of blocks to bring it up to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.260 
two courses of blocks to bring it up to
just<00:00:55.559> below<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> ground<00:00:56.579> level<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> can

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
just below the ground level as you can

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.260 
just below the ground level as you can
see<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.190> also<00:00:59.190> dug<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> pit<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> end<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
see there I also dug a pit at the end to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.390 
see there I also dug a pit at the end to
take<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> pump<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> pond<00:01:04.010> in<00:01:05.010> between

of the second course of blocks that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.850 
of the second course of blocks that
became<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.950> base<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> next

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
became my base for the for the next

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
became my base for the for the next
build<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.460> before<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> there's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
thickness for the rendering and I did

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
thickness for the rendering and I did
the<00:01:49.200> rendering<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.070> segments<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> can

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

done<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> all<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.299> head<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
done it all in one head because this

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.889 
done it all in one head because this
gave<00:01:56.219> me<00:01:56.430> seams<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:57.210> weren't<00:01:57.540> totally

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
gave me seams which weren't totally

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.039 
gave me seams which weren't totally
waterproof<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.729> got<00:02:00.210> around<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.600> by

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
waterproof and I got around that by

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.149

a<00:02:09.429> filter<00:02:09.910> system<00:02:10.239> in<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.660> bottom<00:02:10.989> which<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> a

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
a filter system in the bottom which is a

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.110 
a filter system in the bottom which is a
array<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.160> 40<00:02:12.970> mil<00:02:13.150> waste<00:02:14.019> pipe<00:02:14.319> with<00:02:14.680> lots<00:02:14.920> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
array of 40 mil waste pipe with lots of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.309 
array of 40 mil waste pipe with lots of
three<00:02:16.120> mil<00:02:16.299> holes<00:02:16.510> drilled<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.019> it

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
three mil holes drilled in it

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.770 
three mil holes drilled in it
I<00:02:17.489> then<00:02:18.489> covered<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.940> waste<00:02:19.150> pipe<00:02:19.450> with

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
I then covered the waste pipe with

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.990 
I then covered the waste pipe with
approximately<00:02:20.709> four<00:02:21.370> inches<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.760> pea<00:02:21.970> gravel

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
approximately four inches of pea gravel

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.800 
approximately four inches of pea gravel
which<00:02:22.569> became<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.110> filter<00:02:23.470> medium<00:02:24.810> which

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
which became the filter medium which

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.869 
which became the filter medium which
works<00:02:26.080> very<00:02:26.200> well<00:02:26.410> based<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.580> spider

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
works very well based on the spider

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.610 
works very well based on the spider
