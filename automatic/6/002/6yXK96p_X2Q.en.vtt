00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.420 
hit points right here though most of the
Giants<00:04:18.750> went<00:04:18.930> out<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.380> bottom<00:04:19.979> ring<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
Giants went out of that bottom ring and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.860 
Giants went out of that bottom ring and
unfortunately<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.239> drop<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.509> heel<00:04:21.660> spell

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
unfortunately I drop the heel spell

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.150 
unfortunately I drop the heel spell
their<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.079> both<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.320> my<00:04:22.470> giants<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:22.919> were<00:04:23.009> in

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
their and both of my giants that were in

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.219 
their and both of my giants that were in
the<00:04:23.250> middle<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.699> didn't<00:04:24.330> really<00:04:24.449> benefit

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
the middle of that didn't really benefit

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.390 
the middle of that didn't really benefit
from<00:04:25.259> that<00:04:25.530> probably<00:04:25.830> go<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:25.979> drop<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.280> heel

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
from that probably go to drop the heel

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.920 
from that probably go to drop the heel
spell<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.910> other<00:04:27.060> guys<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.600> will<00:04:27.750> work

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
spell on the other guys and it will work

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.629 
spell on the other guys and it will work
out<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.139> little<00:04:28.320> bit<00:04:28.470> better<00:04:28.650> but<00:04:28.979> was<00:04:29.400> able<00:04:29.490> to

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
out a little bit better but was able to

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.950 
out a little bit better but was able to
break<00:04:29.759> through<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> walls<00:04:30.240> get<00:04:30.509> through<00:04:30.690> both

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
break through the walls get through both

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.100 
break through the walls get through both
expose<00:04:32.270> maybe<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.389> couple<00:04:33.599> guys<00:04:33.810> should<00:04:34.050> have

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
expose maybe a couple guys should have

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.420 
expose maybe a couple guys should have
made<00:04:34.259> their<00:04:34.380> way<00:04:34.410> into<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.830> middle<00:04:34.979> like<00:04:35.220> if<00:04:35.340> I

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
made their way into the middle like if I

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.310 
made their way into the middle like if I
drop<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.910> barb<00:04:36.449> King<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.870> maybe<00:04:36.990> Archer

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
drop the barb King and maybe Archer

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.800 
drop the barb King and maybe Archer
Queen<00:04:37.470> at<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.979> same<00:04:38.340> time<00:04:38.699> on<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.180> top<00:04:39.419> they

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
Queen at the same time on the top they

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.850 
Queen at the same time on the top they
might<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.110> been<00:04:40.169> able<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.470> get<00:04:40.620> into<00:04:40.740> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
might have been able to get into the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.320 
might have been able to get into the
middle<00:04:40.949> maybe<00:04:41.220> knock<00:04:41.490> out<00:04:41.669> that<00:04:41.699> town<00:04:42.060> hall

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
middle maybe knock out that town hall

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.230 
middle maybe knock out that town hall
but<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:43.979> not<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> bad<00:04:44.880> raid

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
but I don't think so so not a bad raid

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.210 
but I don't think so so not a bad raid
overall<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.780> mean<00:04:46.169> could<00:04:46.860> have<00:04:46.949> been<00:04:47.039> a<00:04:47.070> little

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
overall I mean could have been a little

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.040 
overall I mean could have been a little
bit<00:04:47.430> better<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:47.759> forty<00:04:48.060> percent<00:04:48.330> with<00:04:48.780> no

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
bit better but forty percent with no
