I know people are probably going to say

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.770 
I know people are probably going to say
it's<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.770> inputs<00:05:49.370> they're<00:05:49.970> not<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.330> properly

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
it's the inputs they're not in properly

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.290 
it's the inputs they're not in properly
or<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.410> you<00:05:52.310> know<00:05:52.400> those<00:05:52.580> little<00:05:52.700> red<00:05:53.000> yellow

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300
