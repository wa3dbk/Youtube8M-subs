00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.059
 Hello, my name is Anna Baklanova 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.670
 Today I will show you how to make fashion 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.320
 film design and whole 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 make a fashionable design using 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.950
 thermo films per word we took true gel 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.599
 from and sadly the color is called than the lies 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.599
 and raped 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:37.280
 today we have chosen a whole called end 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:41.060
 of so more also includes a nail file. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.030
 or shortening in working with the thermal film 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.230
 I recommend shooting this frame here. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 will allow you to better see the sizes for 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.530
 start picking up one size in 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 At first , do not rush your eye 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.660
 exhibit with time when you choose 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.450
 size we set our chosen 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.050
 Plenochku cuticle cuticle pretending 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.950
 where is the length 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.049
 and a plan where we will shorten 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.930
 why is it necessary first of all these 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.190
 so-called waste can be used 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.470
 further make them moon design and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.990
 all sorts of spikelets 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.620
 but not only for this shortened 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.909
 film is much more convenient to work now 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.820
 the film needs to be heated 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.170
 grab a film for a concert I recommend 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.210
 as close as possible to the next 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 this is for you to provide and as convenient as possible 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.759
 gluing now 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.619
 I grabbed the film or finger with it 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.340
 a place that we will not have 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.590
 used I sticking her just not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.460
 the second leg of the tweezers are now pilots 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.630
 must be heated 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.689
 heat look apparatus runes for 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.810
 drying it gives a very good temperature 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.939
 heat up in the foam so that it from 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.580
 flat plane for him mounds of tyanki 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.130
 heat the film usually 10 15 seconds and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.870
 you'll see it melts like ice cream 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.780
 preferably not heated by 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.330
 worst surface because hot 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.330
 air dried adhesive backing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.770
 we smooth our thermofilm 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.770
 here are the silicone hood 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.860
 find the end of the film never 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.630
 you canâ€™t do that for such wheelbarrows 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.060
 there is a free edge we have to decompose 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.910
 take the perk specifically for filing 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.000
 thermo films 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.410
 inclination towards the film is not allowed 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.850
 Only here such movements as only 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.600
 sawed free edge of the film 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.540
 we shift 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.540
 to remove darts and tidy up 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.730
 until you find a free edge 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:17.300
 the file is not before we remove if suddenly you 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.580
 there is no sawing film do not tear me 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.580
 It was before we make out the free edge 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.230
 now we will overlap with two layers 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 stamp 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.060
 necessarily seal the butt 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.380
 on this nails we will do the rule 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.599
 bag also pick up first exchange 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.380
 there is a substitute film under the elbow 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.380
 cut out 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.540
 here you need to cut as much as possible 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.990
 exactly without any tilt from this 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.380
 will depend on our future points all 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.540
 now with a sharp object we draw on 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.500
 fox fur coat 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.670
 you can handle cut again being 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.480
 french chic so we smile 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.769
 It turned out the same way we remove the film all 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:22.160
 base and heat now 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:24.380
 set the film can not statistki 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.009
 set the film a little bit above it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.250
 places where 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.990
 nail bed goes free edge 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.460
 because here we have 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.990
 transparent part of the nail and when bleak 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.080
 the client will walk with the cover 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.810
 two to three weeks if the film grows and 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.060
 I will see my nail will not 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.400
 very nice and it is in front of you a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:53.360
 besides the game 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:56.960
 nickname recover intro beautiful for 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.970
 in order to make a hole on our nails 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.889
 we just need us and the remnants 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.030
 not always the remainder of french and even under 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:11.340
 cuticle but ours fits 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:18.040
 I just clamp as an actor and nail 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:23.010
 I make an even semicircle street racing 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.010
 you can even cut it a little 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.620
 the wells can not be heated because they 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.410
 find and we traveled it 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.670
 free edge they are at the cuticle 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.750
 where nothing is threatened 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.520
 Today we have learned how to make fashion 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.500
 design using thermofilm he
