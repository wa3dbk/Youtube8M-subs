00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello very welcome in the house 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.259
 with the red sofa bianca got me 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 I wrote if I'm not one 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.929
 pacifier bag came in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 pyramid shape that is it is one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 just got a little bag 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 a pyramid of anklam zipper 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.340
 and is a great place to everywhere 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 hang where a pacifier 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 must have at hand or 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.199
 my kids can go to the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.109
 floating bag hanging since then to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 Take the money with you, for example 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 I'll show you a lot of fun with it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 you need a pyramid bag like that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.700
 Two pieces of fabric that's my outside 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 Islam material thus coated is mistaken 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.469
 what is my inner fabric and the two 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.920
 Fabrics are ten times 20 centimeters long 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 the zipper of the 30 o'clock 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 little waste in this case 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 but I have no other one now 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.379
 and I wanted to record today and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 then you need that is now a piece 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 slanted band made of the same material 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 made or a swirl or something you 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.170
 otherwise want to have their son trailer 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.780
 it does so then it starts 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 you take the outer fabric and the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 Zipper with the outside stops like that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.460
 is then the zipper with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 the super down so laid on it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 and over the councils over the teeth 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.799
 once set what I have fixed 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.320
 email now if you then 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.590
 zipper now opens puts her that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590
 feed 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 from this side against and with again 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.899
 long so I have the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.020
 zipper closed again 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.820
 now it's about us folding that 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:06.689
 and indeed this is the outside 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:08.069
 that means the piece will become her 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.989
 Take the linings you have 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.959
 Travel protection here the super time of 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:19.500
 super time to the top switches that easy 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.940
 So you're stuck here 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 I made now I do the whole thing 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:34.470
 around and here I put it that way 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:39.840
 on the other hand then from the material and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.480
 lining so superimposed exactly there 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.880
 sewn again with the rest of the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.470
 circuit draw as I have since the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.470
 zipper feet in it 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.709
 he loves that at the beginning and at the end 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.000
 so now it looks like this 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.950
 on the right our photo excuse me 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.040
 right outside stock left our butter and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.750
 in the middle a zipper and in the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.450
 background a rampaging otherworld 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.260
 but they should not continue now 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.400
 that's how you hold it now 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.280
 apart 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.360
 that is lining one side it is 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.019
 but from above as below 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.500
 folded up the middle runs the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.630
 above is the outer fabric and 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.120
 In the outer fabric, we now put ours 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 limit so in this case it is just 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.690
 a small piece of diagonal band you can 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.819
 but also the cords what you have there 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:16.660
 a piece of rubber and it puts me that 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.660
 up here just have it on the edge 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.490
 open the zipper one piece 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.080
 at least that you if you are here long 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.080
 not that the super is under it 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.900
 and then it will not be here for a long time 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.060
 march all about is cutting 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.600
 so the zipper that I have now 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.390
 open you can see if you can 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.780
 Now then you should do that 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.780
 easy 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.100
 I suppose here and here towards such as 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.470
 and over the zipper over 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:25.789
 and then that's just coming up 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.789
 about 3 cm in front of the kantor the edge 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:51.700
 So that's what's set now, namely 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:53.950
 until the last needle and so close 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:01.840
 adding zipper cut again 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:07.810
 So of course end and there I want 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.310
 not open turn walls beautiful the 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.420
 corners while pushing out if you 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:18.000
 turned the lining can and thereby 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.000
 so that the bag is already finished 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:29.920
 up to the opening in the feed are 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:33.240
 For that you have to house with a 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.240
 Close the covered loud 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.940
 beat her after you, which still admitted 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.940
 inside clean 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:48.169
 bad and that way the thread 

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:51.819
 does not get along and then again from the inside 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:54.229
 purely and again only through the first location 

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:55.729
 so that one does not from the outside afterwards 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.939
 can see that he has sewn there like that 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:02.599
 she closes this mouth and then is 

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:05.199
 the bag finished I wish you 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:05.199
 have fun with it
