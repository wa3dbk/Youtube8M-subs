sciencebase<00:00:06.590> and<00:00:06.920> have<00:00:07.729> this<00:00:07.939> disconnect

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510

between scientists and the public is
it's<00:00:11.060> a<00:00:11.180> problem<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.350> if<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:12.620> can<00:00:12.800> bridge<00:00:13.130> that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
it's a problem so if we can bridge that

it's a problem so if we can bridge that
through<00:00:13.820> stories<00:00:14.269> through<00:00:14.900> speaking<00:00:15.560> about

great<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.870> have<00:00:36.100> scientists<00:00:37.100> connect<00:00:37.520> with

science and admitting failure is one of
the<00:00:43.880> things<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.300> makes<00:00:44.480> us<00:00:44.780> human<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.350> took

why<00:00:48.830> not<00:00:48.980> have<00:00:49.160> an<00:00:49.280> event<00:00:49.490> focus<00:00:50.450> runs

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
an hour I was a little unsure about

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.070 
an hour I was a little unsure about
coming<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.340> affair<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.659> oral

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
coming to this affair what oral

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.950 
coming to this affair what oral
storytelling<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.600> bind

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
storytelling can do is it can bind

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.770 
storytelling can do is it can bind
people<00:01:22.170> together<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.610> moment<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
people together in the moment you can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.760 
people together in the moment you can
see<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> series<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.030> failures<00:01:27.770> which

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
see this is a series of failures which

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.940 
see this is a series of failures which
lead<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> progression<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> knowledge<00:01:31.590> i

good that day I think the idea that if

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160 
good that day I think the idea that if
you<00:02:11.310> fail<00:02:11.579> you<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> keep<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> yourself

you fail you kind of keep it to yourself

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.069

devastating and then we move on from it
that<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.470> success<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.850> cool<00:02:30.150> part<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.570> this

that is success the cool part about this

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.110 
that is success the cool part about this
event<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:32.130> science<00:02:32.820> experiment

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
event is that it's a science experiment

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.930 
event is that it's a science experiment
in<00:02:33.480> itself<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:34.500> are<00:02:34.650> studying<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.370> reactions

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
in itself we are studying the reactions

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
in itself we are studying the reactions
of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> audience<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.079> quantifying

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
of the audience and then quantifying

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800 
of the audience and then quantifying
that<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.400> publishing<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.329> in<00:02:39.600> a

peer-reviewed<00:02:40.170> paper<00:02:40.650> making<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.730> science

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
peer-reviewed paper making it science

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.410 
peer-reviewed paper making it science
science<00:02:42.930> illiteracy<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.820> going<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:45.000> within

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
science illiteracy is going up within

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.910 
science illiteracy is going up within
the<00:02:45.570> general<00:02:45.720> public<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.650> really

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the general public and that's really

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.849 
the general public and that's really
worrisome<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.850> hope<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> with<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.500> event

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
worrisome I hope is that with this event

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.090 
worrisome I hope is that with this event
we<00:02:50.579> get<00:02:50.790> closer<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.329> goal<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:52.100> engaging

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
we get closer to the goal of engaging

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.890 
we get closer to the goal of engaging
people<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> lifelong<00:02:54.090> learning<00:02:54.420> process

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
people and a lifelong learning process

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.319 
people and a lifelong learning process
of<00:02:55.019> science<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.799> making<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.549> relatable

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
of science and making it relatable

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.559 
of science and making it relatable
that's<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.079> what<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.320> about

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
that's really what it's about

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.629 
that's really what it's about
