let's<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:45.660> nice<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.440> think

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
let's look at the back very nice I think

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.190 
let's look at the back very nice I think
it<00:00:47.039> raises<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> doesn't<00:00:48.360> cut<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it raises it up so it doesn't cut you in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
it raises it up so it doesn't cut you in
half<00:00:49.230> across<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.190> yeah<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
half across the back yeah I think so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
half across the back yeah I think so
yeah<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> also<00:00:52.320> gives<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.039> more

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
yeah and it also gives you a little more

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
yeah and it also gives you a little more
