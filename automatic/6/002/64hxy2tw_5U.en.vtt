00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
new kernel called Jedi kernels II which

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.750 
new kernel called Jedi kernels II which
is<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.570> major<00:00:27.869> upgrade<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.250> see<00:00:29.429> there

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
is a major upgrade as you can see there

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.280 
is a major upgrade as you can see there
and<00:00:30.230> basically<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> latest<00:00:31.769> kernel<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:34.110> can

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and basically the latest kernel you can

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.190 
and basically the latest kernel you can
use<00:00:34.410> trickster<00:00:34.770> mod<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.170> overclock<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
use trickster mod here and overclock it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.530 
use trickster mod here and overclock it
to<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.590> point<00:00:37.800> nine<00:00:38.070> four<00:00:38.399> four<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to one point nine four four and I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.200 
to one point nine four four and I
actually<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:40.110> being<00:00:40.379> able<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> run<00:00:40.980> at

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
actually actually being able to run at

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.049 
actually actually being able to run at
that<00:00:42.210> high<00:00:43.020> frequency<00:00:43.700> for<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> couple<00:00:44.969> hours

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that high frequency for a couple hours

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
that high frequency for a couple hours
pretty<00:00:45.750> stable<00:00:46.110> even<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:46.980> point<00:00:47.010> nine

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
pretty stable even at one point nine

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.010 
pretty stable even at one point nine
four<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.149> gigahertz<00:00:48.719> uhm<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.129> kernel<00:00:50.550> also

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
four four gigahertz uhm this kernel also

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.880 
four four gigahertz uhm this kernel also
does<00:00:52.370> use<00:00:53.370> hot<00:00:53.699> plug<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.390> shuts<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.410> course

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
does use hot plug which shuts off course

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830 
does use hot plug which shuts off course
we're<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.250> using<00:00:56.489> him<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.390> should<00:00:57.600> give

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
we're not using him so it should give

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
we're not using him so it should give
you<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.350> extra<00:00:58.980> overclocking<00:00:59.879> while<00:01:00.059> also

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you that extra overclocking while also

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
you that extra overclocking while also
saving<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> batter<00:01:01.230> better<00:01:01.559> battery<00:01:02.100> life

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
saving you batter better battery life

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.600 
saving you batter better battery life
and<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:03.300> does<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:04.010> GPU<00:01:05.010> also

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and also does come with GPU also

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
and also does come with GPU also
overclock<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.360> 320<00:01:07.200> megahertz

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
overclock to 320 megahertz

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
overclock to 320 megahertz
that's<00:01:08.520> by<00:01:08.700> default<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> do

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that's by default you don't have to do

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.630 
that's by default you don't have to do
anything<00:01:10.310> that's<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:14.220> does

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
anything that's there and and also does

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.410 
anything that's there and and also does
have<00:01:14.670> bln<00:01:15.509> supports<00:01:16.310> your<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.790> notification

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
have bln supports your your notification

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.390 
have bln supports your your notification
lights<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> nice<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.100> latest

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
lights which is nice with the latest

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
lights which is nice with the latest
kernel<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.360> those<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> major<00:01:22.140> updates

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
kernel so those are the major updates

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
kernel so those are the major updates
other<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.330> slight<00:01:24.960> menus<00:01:25.500> have

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
other than that the slight menus have

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.510 
other than that the slight menus have
been<00:01:26.759> integrated<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.810> Jedi<00:01:28.020> ROM<00:01:28.259> tricks<00:01:28.619> some

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
been integrated in Jedi ROM tricks some

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.390 
been integrated in Jedi ROM tricks some
of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> menus<00:01:29.970> happen<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:31.400> integrated

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
of the menus happen more integrated

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
of the menus happen more integrated
better<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.200> apps<00:01:34.470> such<00:01:34.799> as

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
better and also all these apps such as

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
better and also all these apps such as
LMT<00:01:35.280> PI<00:01:35.729> launch<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.210> icon<00:01:36.509> changer<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
LMT PI launch or icon changer these have

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.300 
LMT PI launch or icon changer these have
also<00:01:37.950> been<00:01:38.280> updated<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.030> latest<00:01:39.119> version

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
also been updated to the latest version

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.969 
also been updated to the latest version
that's<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.880> much<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> changes<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.979> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's pretty much the changes and the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.440 
that's pretty much the changes and the
most<00:01:44.369> important<00:01:44.790> thing<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
most important thing is really the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.230 
most important thing is really the
kernel<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.590> definitely<00:01:47.130> you'll<00:01:47.460> notice<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
kernel so definitely you'll notice a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
kernel so definitely you'll notice a
little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.869> performance<00:01:49.740> abuse<00:01:50.060> obviously

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
little bit performance abuse obviously

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.340 
little bit performance abuse obviously
if<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> overclock<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.020> point<00:01:52.229> nine

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
if you overclock it to one point nine

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
if you overclock it to one point nine
four<00:01:52.590> four<00:01:52.740> gigahertz<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.369> also<00:01:53.790> should<00:01:54.000> give

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
four four gigahertz and also should give

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.030 
four four gigahertz and also should give
you<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.329> much<00:01:54.540> better<00:01:54.720> battery<00:01:55.140> life<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.710> for

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you a much better battery life and for

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
you a much better battery life and for
those<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.430> new<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.090> ROM<00:01:57.329> let<00:01:57.630> me<00:01:57.719> kind
