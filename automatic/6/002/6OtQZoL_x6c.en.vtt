for<00:02:38.840> obviously<00:02:39.409> given<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.739> nature's<00:02:40.099> for

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
for obviously given the nature's for

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.429 
for obviously given the nature's for
kids<00:02:40.609> but<00:02:40.909> you<00:02:41.450> know<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.840> they're<00:02:42.049> these<00:02:42.260> are

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
base on the 1980s designs and not

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.809 
base on the 1980s designs and not
something<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.200> were<00:02:45.319> like<00:02:45.530> retaliation<00:02:46.219> or

something you were like retaliation or

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.149 
something you were like retaliation or
even<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.269> rise<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.200> cobra<00:02:48.409> it's<00:02:48.889> kind<00:02:49.099> of

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
even the rise of cobra it's kind of

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.530 
even the rise of cobra it's kind of
surprising<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.909> don't<00:02:50.090> think<00:02:50.180> too<00:02:50.299> many

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
surprising and I don't think too many

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.349 
surprising and I don't think too many
older<00:02:51.170> Jojo<00:02:51.590> fans<00:02:51.829> like<00:02:52.010> myself<00:02:52.189> are<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:53.120> to

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
be into these but I think they're pretty

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.019
