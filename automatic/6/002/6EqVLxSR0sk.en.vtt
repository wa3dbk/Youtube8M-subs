result is the same you'll get an 8-inch
finished<00:00:40.050> block<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.770> dyes<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.190> slightly

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
finished block the dyes are slightly

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
finished block the dyes are slightly
different<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.090> today<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
different so today I'm going to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.950 
different so today I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:43.170> using<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.520> studio<00:00:44.820> dye<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:45.809> we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
demonstrate using the studio dye when we

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
demonstrate using the studio dye when we
get<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> actual<00:00:46.680> sewing<00:00:47.010> instructions<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
get to the actual sewing instructions it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.340 
get to the actual sewing instructions it
will<00:00:48.329> apply<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> both<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> studio

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
will apply to both they go in the studio

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
will apply to both they go in the studio
let's<00:00:52.350> take<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.640> winding<00:00:54.270> ways

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
let's take a look at the winding ways

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.810 
let's take a look at the winding ways
studio<00:00:54.930> die<00:00:57.079> there<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> giant<00:00:59.640> die

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
studio die there are this is a giant die

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.340 
studio die there are this is a giant die
so<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> board<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.440> large<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.850> are

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
so the board is pretty large there are

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.289 
so the board is pretty large there are
three<00:01:04.350> shapes<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.460> die<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> have

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
three shapes on this die that I have

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
three shapes on this die that I have
labeled<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.080> B<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> C<00:01:08.720> as<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.320> guy<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
labeled a B and C as with any guy that I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
labeled a B and C as with any guy that I
own<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.570> always<00:01:12.960> outline<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.549> silver

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
own I always outline them with a silver

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
own I always outline them with a silver
sharpie<00:01:15.210> marker<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.020> helps<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> see

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
sharpie marker so that helps you to see

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.899 
sharpie marker so that helps you to see
better<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> video<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> also<00:01:19.110> helps<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
better on the video and it also helps to

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
better on the video and it also helps to
see<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.689> cutting<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.570> nice<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.229> about

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
see as I'm cutting the nice thing about

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.070 
see as I'm cutting the nice thing about
the<00:01:25.770> studio<00:01:26.130> die<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.780> cut

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the studio die is that it's going to cut

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800 
the studio die is that it's going to cut
the<00:01:28.290> full<00:01:28.650> winding<00:01:29.400> lanes<00:01:29.579> block<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.570> once

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the full winding lanes block all at once

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.580 
the full winding lanes block all at once
so<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.360> worrying<00:01:33.360> about<00:01:33.470> matching<00:01:34.470> up

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so you're not worrying about matching up

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
so you're not worrying about matching up
pieces<00:01:35.070> 1<00:01:35.700> 12<00:01:36.090> inch<00:01:36.329> square<00:01:36.750> which<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
pieces 1 12 inch square which I have

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.429 
pieces 1 12 inch square which I have
also<00:01:38.100> marked<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> die<00:01:39.030> itself<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.200> cut<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
also marked on the die itself if I cut a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.690 
also marked on the die itself if I cut a
12<00:01:40.619> inch<00:01:40.920> square<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
12 inch square that's going to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.880 
12 inch square that's going to
completely<00:01:42.270> cover<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.170> winding<00:01:43.920> ways<00:01:44.040> shape

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
completely cover the winding ways shape

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700 
completely cover the winding ways shape
traditionally<00:01:46.890> winding<00:01:47.310> ways<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.880> cut<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.899> two

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
traditionally winding ways is cut in two

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.520 
traditionally winding ways is cut in two
or<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.340> stitch<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.299> alternating<00:01:52.110> colors

or it stitch with two alternating colors
so<00:01:53.220> today's<00:01:53.850> demonstration<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> be

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so today's demonstration is going to be

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.940 
so today's demonstration is going to be
with<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.500> violet<00:01:56.130> color<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.990> neutral<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
with a violet color and a neutral so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.760 
with a violet color and a neutral so
that<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.310> come<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.549> really<00:01:59.729> nicely<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.619> what

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that will come out really nicely so what

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.459 
that will come out really nicely so what
I've<00:02:01.860> done<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.579> die<00:02:02.880> also<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.200> have

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
I've done on this die also is I have

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.490 
I've done on this die also is I have
drawn<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.100> registration<00:02:05.729> lines<00:02:06.119> which

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
drawn to registration lines which

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.950 
drawn to registration lines which
you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.740> see<00:02:07.010> matching<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.210> in<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.390> corner

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
you can see matching here in the corner

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.170 
you can see matching here in the corner
this<00:02:09.649> dye<00:02:10.550> does<00:02:11.060> not<00:02:11.330> have<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.990> shapes

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
this dye does not have the shapes

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.430 
this dye does not have the shapes
completely<00:02:14.180> aligned<00:02:14.510> they<00:02:14.690> are<00:02:14.870> spread<00:02:15.410> out

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
completely aligned they are spread out

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.550 
completely aligned they are spread out
and<00:02:15.970> shifted<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.090> little<00:02:17.300> bit<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.200> will

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and shifted a little bit so you will

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.270 
and shifted a little bit so you will
need<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.160> align<00:02:20.470> your<00:02:21.470> registration<00:02:22.160> line

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
need to align your registration line

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.030 
need to align your registration line
I've<00:02:22.610> marked<00:02:22.940> one<00:02:23.240> quarter<00:02:23.600> inch<00:02:23.780> outside<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
I've marked one quarter inch outside the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.250 
I've marked one quarter inch outside the
topmost<00:02:25.459> shape<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.300> I'm<00:02:26.840> drawing<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.200> straight

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
topmost shape and I'm drawing a straight

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.410 
topmost shape and I'm drawing a straight
line<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.070> then<00:02:28.490> I've<00:02:28.610> done<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.880> same<00:02:28.910> thing

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
line and then I've done the same thing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.630 
line and then I've done the same thing
on<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> side<00:02:30.050> which<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.070> quarter<00:02:31.459> inch

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
on the side which is a quarter inch

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.920 
on the side which is a quarter inch
outside<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:34.459> outermost<00:02:34.760> shape<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
outside the the outermost shape and so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.160 
outside the the outermost shape and so
that<00:02:36.230> gives<00:02:36.470> me<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> nice<00:02:37.250> line<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.970> align<00:02:38.840> my

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that gives me a nice line to align my

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.900 
that gives me a nice line to align my
fabric<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.670> I'd<00:02:43.940> actually<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:45.610> some<00:02:46.610> 12

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
fabric to so I'd actually have some 12

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.930 
fabric to so I'd actually have some 12
inch<00:02:47.120> squares<00:02:47.570> here<00:02:48.160> I've<00:02:49.160> got<00:02:49.430> four<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> them

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
inch squares here I've got four of them

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.729 
inch squares here I've got four of them
because<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:50.480> going<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:51.050> making<00:02:51.410> four

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
because I'm going to be making four

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.620 
because I'm going to be making four
blocks<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.360> will<00:02:53.660> need<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.150> each

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
blocks so you will need one of each

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.830 
blocks so you will need one of each
color<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.950> typically<00:02:58.310> end<00:02:58.640> up<00:02:58.820> with<00:02:59.120> two

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
color so you typically end up with two

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390 
color so you typically end up with two
blocks<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.320> if<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.500> use<00:03:00.650> one<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.010> each<00:03:01.130> color

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
blocks so if you use one of each color

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.670 
blocks so if you use one of each color
you<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:01.880> two<00:03:02.090> blocks<00:03:02.360> two<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.660> each<00:03:02.780> color<00:03:03.020> you

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you get two blocks two of each color you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.550 
you get two blocks two of each color you
get<00:03:03.800> four<00:03:04.100> blocks<00:03:04.340> etc<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.780> isn't<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
get four blocks etc this isn't really a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.490 
get four blocks etc this isn't really a
block<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.520> do<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.200> if

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
block that you can do just one of you if

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.320 
block that you can do just one of you if
you<00:03:09.590> really<00:03:09.800> need<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.220> cut<00:03:10.430> two<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:11.000> order<00:03:11.209> to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
you really need to cut two in order to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.060 
you really need to cut two in order to
have<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.780> alternating<00:03:12.350> colors<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.950> you

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
have the alternating colors that you

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.630 
have the alternating colors that you
need<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.480> have<00:03:14.750> aligned<00:03:15.140> these<00:03:15.620> these<00:03:16.580> four

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
need so I have aligned these these four

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.580 
need so I have aligned these these four
fabrics<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:19.660> fabric<00:03:20.660> face<00:03:20.930> up<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.410> I'm

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
fabrics with the fabric face up and I'm

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.150 
fabrics with the fabric face up and I'm
going<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.830> lay<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.010> face<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.700> on<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.000> die<00:03:24.160> so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
going to lay that face up on the die so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.640 
going to lay that face up on the die so
you<00:03:25.220> can't<00:03:25.519> see<00:03:25.790> me<00:03:25.970> do<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.299> here<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.320> will

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
you can't see me do that here but I will

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.080 
you can't see me do that here but I will
show<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.269> second<00:03:29.750> okay<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.970> I've

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
show it to you in a second okay so I've

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.410 
show it to you in a second okay so I've
got<00:03:35.329> those<00:03:35.570> squares<00:03:36.310> they<00:03:37.310> are<00:03:37.610> aligned<00:03:38.180> on

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
got those squares they are aligned on

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.870 
got those squares they are aligned on
the<00:03:38.750> die<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.980> registration<00:03:40.519> marks

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
the die with the registration marks

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400 
the die with the registration marks
they're<00:03:41.239> straight<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.019> we're<00:03:42.230> going<00:03:42.350> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
they're straight and now we're going to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.759 
they're straight and now we're going to
do<00:03:42.560> some<00:03:42.769> cutting<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.280> see<00:03:43.459> in<00:03:43.579> a<00:03:43.670> second

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
do some cutting so see in a second

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.860 
do some cutting so see in a second
alright<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:46.250> why<00:03:46.400> new<00:03:46.610> ways<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:47.030> all<00:03:47.269> cut<00:03:47.600> I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
alright so why new ways is all cut I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.620 
alright so why new ways is all cut I
always<00:03:48.590> like<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.920> take<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.850> look<00:03:50.060> at<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.390> fun

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
always like to take a look at the fun

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.259 
always like to take a look at the fun
shapes<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.620> waste<00:03:51.980> cream<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.239> a

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
shapes that the waste cream so this is a

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.560 
shapes that the waste cream so this is a
winding<00:03:54.200> way<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.709> completely<00:03:54.920> cut<00:03:55.610> out<00:03:55.640> so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
winding way it's completely cut out so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.800 
winding way it's completely cut out so
I've<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:57.110> removed<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:58.040> waste<00:03:58.810> fabric

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
I've just removed the waste fabric

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.720 
I've just removed the waste fabric
around<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.440> die<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.250> can<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.610> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
around the die so that you can see the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.840 
around the die so that you can see the
shapes<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.239> little<00:04:02.329> bit<00:04:02.600> more<00:04:02.750> clearly<00:04:03.019> cut<00:04:03.380> out

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
shapes a little bit more clearly cut out

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.979 
shapes a little bit more clearly cut out
now<00:04:04.850> when<00:04:05.840> winding<00:04:06.320> ways<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:08.120> pieced<00:04:08.630> it

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
now when winding ways is this pieced it

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.340 
now when winding ways is this pieced it
is<00:04:09.890> as<00:04:10.250> I<00:04:10.549> mentioned<00:04:10.940> before<00:04:11.060> piece<00:04:11.690> so<00:04:12.140> that

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
is as I mentioned before piece so that

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.870 
is as I mentioned before piece so that
you<00:04:12.620> have<00:04:13.030> alternating<00:04:14.030> colors<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.200> four

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you have alternating colors so the four

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.360 
you have alternating colors so the four
centerpieces

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
centerpieces

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.939 
centerpieces
a<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:18.380> going<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.709> be<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.280> same<00:04:20.549> color<00:04:21.290> while<00:04:22.290> B

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
a are going to be the same color while B

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.850 
a are going to be the same color while B
and<00:04:23.100> C<00:04:23.400> are<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:24.150> different<00:04:24.510> color<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.590> what<00:04:25.770> I'm

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
and C are a different color so what I'm

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.390 
and C are a different color so what I'm
going<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.669> I'm<00:04:26.820> actually<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.570> to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
going to do is I'm actually going to

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.189 
going to do is I'm actually going to
reverse<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:31.169> shapes<00:04:31.530> for<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.750> have

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
reverse the shapes for a so that I have

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.620 
reverse the shapes for a so that I have
the<00:04:34.620> purple<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.400> top<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:36.120> that's<00:04:36.360> going<00:04:36.570> to

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
the purple on top and that's going to

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.090 
the purple on top and that's going to
help<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.960> see<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:37.350> just<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.770> little<00:04:37.979> bit

better so I'm going to reverse those
four<00:04:40.979> shapes<00:04:41.280> as<00:04:41.520> opposed<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:43.080> eight

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
four shapes as opposed to the eight

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.050 
four shapes as opposed to the eight
other<00:04:43.800> shapes<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:44.970> have<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.900> die<00:04:47.060> so

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
other shapes that I have on the die so

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.390 
other shapes that I have on the die so
that's<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.479> gonna<00:04:48.780> take<00:04:49.110> one<00:04:49.350> second<00:04:50.100> here

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that's just gonna take one second here

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.879 
that's just gonna take one second here
and<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.970> reason<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.389> do<00:04:51.449> this<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:52.229> because<00:04:52.440> this

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
and the reason I do this is because this

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.020 
and the reason I do this is because this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
is going to help me piece this very

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.540 
is going to help me piece this very
easily<00:04:57.360> because<00:04:58.080> all<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.650> pieces<00:04:58.979> are<00:04:59.370> going

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
easily because all the pieces are going

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.379 
easily because all the pieces are going
to<00:04:59.690> match<00:05:00.690> up<00:05:01.370> with<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.610> right<00:05:02.760> color<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.120> I'll

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
to match up with the right color so I'll

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.820 
to match up with the right color so I'll
have<00:05:03.600> these<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.199> order<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.590> they're

have these in the order that they're
going<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.070> be<00:05:05.190> stitched<00:05:05.669> alright<00:05:06.479> so<00:05:06.690> again

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
going to be stitched alright so again

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.800 
going to be stitched alright so again
what<00:05:07.260> I've<00:05:07.380> done<00:05:07.590> is<00:05:08.160> when<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:08.940> originally<00:05:09.330> cut

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
what I've done is when I originally cut

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.379 
what I've done is when I originally cut
this<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.380> had<00:05:10.710> two<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.270> white<00:05:13.940> squares<00:05:14.940> on

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
this I had two of the white squares on

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.610 
this I had two of the white squares on
top<00:05:16.229> of<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.919> two<00:05:17.130> purple<00:05:17.400> ones<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.289> cut

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
top of the two purple ones and so I cut

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.000 
top of the two purple ones and so I cut
that<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.570> then<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.810> just<00:05:22.200> moved<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.770> two

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
that and then I just moved the two

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.990 
that and then I just moved the two
purple<00:05:23.340> shapes<00:05:24.300> for<00:05:25.260> shape<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.590> on<00:05:26.280> top<00:05:26.639> of<00:05:26.849> the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
purple shapes for shape a on top of the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.760 
purple shapes for shape a on top of the
white<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.450> those<00:05:27.599> are<00:05:27.750> still<00:05:27.990> stacked<00:05:28.320> on<00:05:28.530> here

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
white so those are still stacked on here

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.170 
white so those are still stacked on here
so<00:05:28.919> you<00:05:29.010> can<00:05:29.160> see<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.729> is<00:05:29.940> going<00:05:30.090> to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
so you can see that this is going to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.060 
so you can see that this is going to
make<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.539> neat<00:05:30.960> block<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.380> I'll<00:05:31.500> actually<00:05:31.680> have

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
make a neat block so I'll actually have

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.980 
make a neat block so I'll actually have
two<00:05:32.400> alternating<00:05:33.090> color<00:05:33.389> patterns<00:05:33.840> and

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
two alternating color patterns and

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.300 
two alternating color patterns and
you'll<00:05:34.080> see<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.530> when<00:05:34.740> we<00:05:34.860> get<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.220> the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
you'll see that when we get to the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.920 
you'll see that when we get to the
actual<00:05:35.460> stitching<00:05:38.479> since<00:05:39.479> we're<00:05:39.630> going<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.810> be

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
actual stitching since we're going to be

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.750 
actual stitching since we're going to be

for<00:05:56.280> winding<00:05:56.639> ways<00:05:56.789> which<00:05:57.120> is<00:05:57.360> kind<00:05:57.990> of

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
for winding ways which is kind of

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.990 
for winding ways which is kind of
important<00:05:58.650> because<00:05:58.800> there<00:05:59.160> are<00:05:59.190> so<00:05:59.400> many<00:05:59.669> of

winding waste pieces to the sewing area

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.909 
winding waste pieces to the sewing area
so<00:06:08.729> I'll<00:06:08.880> get<00:06:09.060> that<00:06:09.300> all<00:06:09.870> lined<00:06:10.260> up<00:06:10.410> here<00:06:10.680> and
