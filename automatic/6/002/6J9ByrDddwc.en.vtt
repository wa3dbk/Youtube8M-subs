00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.370
 at 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.960
 we are in the turbine card so here in 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.820
 done at this place is so close to emptiness 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.440
 but next to the bus actually we can when 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.630
 even sneaking a little further 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.129
 there for without falling you look at the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.200
 purpose if there is a ventilation grid and 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.760
 see her a kind of circle and well 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.760
 you will start to flash as 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.230
 that it's not you finally too 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.510
 far from falling so to throw a small 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.190
 little but when it blinks like that you 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.680
 move more you will see move more 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.360
 tac admits to pivot on the right 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.530
 and now you will have the view of 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.540
 the enemy there that will arrive at the bottom 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.020
 be careful that otherwise after we 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.690
 falls 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.170
 So here is the hoy up level of this 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.320
 circle here next you have embankments 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.850
 in this map so we are here and you 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.770
 Have slope like the one that is 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 left and you had some 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.430
 in the map know that say that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.690
 know that in fact you can return 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.479
 in so they will help you 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 like for example this one or when 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.590
 not move you see it's still 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.060
 pretty cool enough to surprise 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 the enemy then after you have to test in 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.000
 different game modes we search and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.890
 destruction domination see what that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 gives in any case it's a place you can 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.380
 get in there are some 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.240
 in this map and they are pretty 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.000
 interesting third location here 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.280
 a bug in fact of development I think 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.110
 you'll see it's pretty funny 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.929
 are more what's that a bug of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.700
 development I think the machine gun 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.520
 here we can take it when we are 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 still at two or three meters 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 behind you will see course is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.939
 here see the almost square ai and hop 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.439
 see it's down on it 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.700
 it's not a bug it's not a cut 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.219
 video from me you can test it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.719
 and I think it will be fixed but good 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.649
 it's a little bug rents since 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.899
 Norman it would have to be a little 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.179
 closer and then we finish here by so 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.640
 this fourth location is so this 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.229
 fourth leach but actually here in 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.209
 some courses still on the rock 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.569
 hansson on this kind of bits of 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.879
 sheet metal 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.860
 here we can stay hooked and that 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.440
 do a little spot that's nice for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.019
 the enemies who will be my place with a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.019
 little high spots here bridge
