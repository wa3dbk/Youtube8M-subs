00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
plant there that's it no harvest at that

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900 
plant there that's it no harvest at that
time<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.680> got<00:02:34.799> probably<00:02:35.130> maybe<00:02:35.370> two<00:02:35.700> or

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
time that's got probably maybe two or

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
time that's got probably maybe two or
three<00:02:35.940> varieties<00:02:36.299> over<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.989> whole<00:02:37.140> lot

three varieties over the whole lot

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.520 
three varieties over the whole lot
you<00:02:38.130> should<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.400> 30<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:38.850> 40<00:02:44.989> well<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.109> animal

ago by this time of the year they are

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.510 
ago by this time of the year they are
getting<00:04:49.020> seventeen<00:04:49.470> eighteen<00:04:49.890> cents<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.340> litre

getting seventeen eighteen cents a litre

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.690 
getting seventeen eighteen cents a litre
do<00:04:51.270> they<00:04:51.390> know<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.469> such<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.680> huge<00:04:53.070> volume<00:04:53.460> of

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
do they know it is such a huge volume of

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.390 
do they know it is such a huge volume of
it

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
it

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.760 
it
and<00:04:54.610> there's<00:04:54.820> such<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.000> huge<00:04:55.360> turnover<00:04:55.930> it's

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
and there's such a huge turnover it's

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.129 
and there's such a huge turnover it's
actually<00:04:57.280> viable<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.940> run<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.090> farm<00:04:58.419> at<00:04:58.690> 40

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
actually viable to run a farm at 40

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.280 
actually viable to run a farm at 40
cents<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.470> litre<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:01.180> lay<00:05:01.389> people<00:05:01.660> think<00:05:02.080> so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
cents a litre the lay people think so

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.950 
cents a litre the lay people think so
now<00:05:02.500> but<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.820> biggest<00:05:04.120> problem<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.570> think<00:05:04.630> with

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
now but the biggest problem I think with

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.810 
now but the biggest problem I think with
the<00:05:05.139> whole<00:05:05.290> industry<00:05:05.949> is<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.400> farmers

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the whole industry is that the farmers

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.150 
the whole industry is that the farmers
and<00:05:07.449> not<00:05:07.570> only<00:05:07.720> dairy<00:05:08.110> farmers<00:05:08.620> but<00:05:08.889> beef

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
and not only dairy farmers but beef

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.640 
and not only dairy farmers but beef
farmers<00:05:09.699> we<00:05:10.000> shape<00:05:10.449> everybody<00:05:11.020> gets<00:05:11.440> what's

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
farmers we shape everybody gets what's

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.550 
farmers we shape everybody gets what's
left<00:05:12.300> they<00:05:13.300> get<00:05:13.510> what's<00:05:13.750> left<00:05:14.050> in<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.260> bottom

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
left they get what's left in the bottom

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.920 
left they get what's left in the bottom
of<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.740> barrel<00:05:17.940> they're<00:05:18.940> less<00:05:19.150> farmers<00:05:19.660> about

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
of the barrel they're less farmers about

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.439 
of the barrel they're less farmers about
because<00:05:20.680> it's<00:05:20.919> less<00:05:21.310> financially<00:05:21.910> viable<00:05:22.090> to

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
because it's less financially viable to

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:23.850 
because it's less financially viable to
run<00:05:22.600> farms<00:05:22.960> is<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.229> getting<00:05:23.470> more<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.800> more

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
run farms is it getting more and more

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.189 
run farms is it getting more and more
difficult<00:05:24.400> for<00:05:24.460> farmers<00:05:24.729> in<00:05:25.030> Australia

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
difficult for farmers in Australia

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.110 
difficult for farmers in Australia
farmers<00:05:26.199> are<00:05:26.350> getting<00:05:26.440> very<00:05:26.740> frustrated<00:05:27.120> and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
farmers are getting very frustrated and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.360 
farmers are getting very frustrated and
not<00:05:28.630> only<00:05:28.830> frustrated<00:05:29.830> because<00:05:29.979> of<00:05:30.160> the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
not only frustrated because of the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.790 
not only frustrated because of the
continually<00:05:31.000> low<00:05:31.180> prices<00:05:31.750> but<00:05:32.289> because<00:05:32.770> of

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
continually low prices but because of

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.159 
continually low prices but because of
the<00:05:32.949> droughts<00:05:33.310> as<00:05:33.610> well<00:05:33.900> so<00:05:34.900> if<00:05:35.020> they're

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
the droughts as well so if they're

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.710 
the droughts as well so if they're
basically<00:05:35.710> an<00:05:35.949> increased<00:05:36.550> pressure<00:05:37.180> for

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
basically an increased pressure for

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.170 
basically an increased pressure for
farmers<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.350> produce<00:05:38.800> more<00:05:39.280> milk<00:05:39.340> they<00:05:39.970> don't

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
farmers to produce more milk they don't

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.790 
farmers to produce more milk they don't
they're<00:05:40.360> not<00:05:40.389> is<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:41.020> current<00:05:41.320> system<00:05:41.470> not

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
they're not is the current system not

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.029 
they're not is the current system not
favoring<00:05:42.310> small<00:05:42.610> farms<00:05:43.090> hmm<00:05:43.889> definitely<00:05:44.889> not
