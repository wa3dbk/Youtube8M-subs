00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.000
 you want cocky now see mini crossover 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.200
 c-class estate from this used to and 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.320
 car week welcomes a new one 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.280
 columnists hello and welcome to it 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.350
 car week journal 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.850
 the rougher your model, the more of it 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.560
 At least it seems to be selling 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.910
 nowadays with the cross government 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.040
 that in all segments around it 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.520
 grabs but looks do go there too 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.020
 to join 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.910
 but of course it can be on its citroëns 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.900
 and so just a little bit different than all 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.300
 Others 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.289
 because otherwise the new ctx will be there 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 Alexander 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.200
 yes it is usually that you will currently 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.390
 b-segment crossover looks like the captur 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.730
 Peugeot Citroën has in 2008 but 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 of course the cactus that is the c4 cactus 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 who is slightly upstairs 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.880
 but the c2 xr name already has it 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
 at c2 that's just a bit below that 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.760
 b segment 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.280
 and that will be a crossover 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.620
 about three meters 90 and when you consider 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.380
 that the competition like that captur so 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.570
 that is 4 meters ten so actually it is 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.980
 a bit higher in the market 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.910
 posted this becomes the really something 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.340
 underneath 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.119
 okay because yes Peugeot could have enjoyed it 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.159
 Citroën course 2008 is ic 2x 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.859
 there on that fit 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.549
 it will be the platform of 208 indeed 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.319
 yes okay and then he goes down a bit 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.850
 the c4 cactus also operates slightly below the 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.259
 captur 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.509
 but then again above the a-segment 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.549
 it is this is really not filling or 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.929
 late is actually a new segment you 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.639
 what a bit so the emergence or 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.049
 I might have to say segment we 

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:36.340
 already had the renault a while back 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.229
 kwid his car that is also on the roll 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.509
 for production later this decade it 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.039
 the Volkswagen too 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.709
 they are all slightly smaller 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.349
 car smoothie also a bit rougher 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.479
 However, they look different and I think 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.490
 so that in the course of this decade that 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.770
 We have many more models in that segment 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.029
 because why should people fall under 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.649
 the b segment 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.450
 that you are also a bit more adventurous 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.369
 old piece because it is still 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.630
 so there later this decade 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.930
 little future music and because when 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.090
 we go that quit and and in this kind 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.110
 the c 2x have 9, but expect that yes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.740
 the quit comes at the earliest 2016 and the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.740
 c 2x only according to the end of 2017 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.150
 autoplus our french colleagues so that 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.600
 indeed to be patient to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
 to have 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.620
 ok well I'm very curious about this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 megan's are doing well in the netherlands and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.010
 especially if they are of the luxury variant 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.780
 hence the introduction of the new one 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.970
 c-class estate reason is to have one 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.709
 opposite the 3-series touring of BMW and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.120
 to turn the audi a4 avant 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.220
 Mercedes already made an impression with the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.050
 c-class dam and also it always shows 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.130
 a strong new entry 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.350
 he especially impresses with his 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.090
 space offer and safety features 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.980
 the bmw 3 series touring states one 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.780
 excellent powertrain opposite 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.790
 while both audi a4 avant is now 10 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.500
 years begin to count 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.820
 yet the seven year old a4 still appears 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.320
 very nice to be able to come along in this 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.489
 competitive segment 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.140
 but whether you are also good enough to 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.910
 competition still cope 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.420
 you can read that from week 43 that of the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.590
 will be available in stores on Wednesday 22 October 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.450
 this week we welcome a new one 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.840
 settlers settled out in the coming weeks 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.950
 is going 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.600
 Pink Scholtens will keep you informed 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.100
 of the ups and downs around getting 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.900
 her driver's license 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.760
 rosa you have been students for some time 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.080
 journalism from where now suddenly it 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.370
 the moment you think now i will go mine 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.290
 get a driver's license 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.570
 well i have nothing to do with cars 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.840
 but I came from the hands of Robert or me 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.549
 against a kind of network drink and 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.530
 I pulled it on his sleeve and I would 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.180
 a pity that I don't turn anything off because I do 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.130
 would love to work for you and then he said 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.820
 well we can do something about it 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.180
 have your license already sees as 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.430
 all right 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.709
 and you now have balls baby how are you 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.019
 you good child very nice and with it 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.510
 instructors satisfied so that then one 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.010
 like to grow naturally i think and i like one 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.080
 monument hit 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.850
 that is definitely a good sign whole 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.400
 good basis to build on what 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.950
 find yourself it would be difficult after naturally 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.420
 well i must now i am not such a point we 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.730
 have done cultivation ministry and now 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.410
 I have to watch signs and so that 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.079
 I have had a very good long time 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.930
 left to my my instructor 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.340
 but now I say no more and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.780
 I have to do it myself so me 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.590
 gotta be there a bit of a time and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.030
 put energy in and yes just the group 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.010
 in trying 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.120
 no one stays yes that seems to be one 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.650
 anyway in very wise there are features 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.930
 yes yes you drive in the center of 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.310
 van utrecht because you already live it 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.120
 extra difficult I think first meters one 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.880
 big city 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.080
 yes it is now i don't know any better than the 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 can imagine in the countryside 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.460
 quite like your mind but yes it will be busy 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.350
 many cyclists and that I look at myself 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270
 I also get as an idiot on as one 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.470
 a bike 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.139
 so i it is absolutely not the super 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 simple but I think so 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.350
 extra instructive but then you give us the 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.949
 We could have been happy with coming weeks 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.419
 about that 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.199
 what can we expect from you in terms of 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.760
 style a bit funny with one 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.000
 critical note 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.000
 I think I am pretty sorry 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.050
 on details and I watch him all one 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.850
 bit of a kind of wonder one 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.990
 look i ask from there all that happens 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.410
 wonder why 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.150
 and that I go on and then with a yes 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.210
 funny but also a bit 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.530
 so a completely different view of driving lessons 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.690
 yes yes it is so is also a women 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.800
 perspectives to choke men's magazine what 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.710
 especially made by men 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.139
 in between i think my 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.039
 my view on cars and driving 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.800
 Anyway 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.910
 different from what is normally 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.160
 capable it is usually very general 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.430
 entirely you guess things from one 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.080
 certain kind of logic that it anyway 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.789
 more freely everyone knows that is true 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 now i get with stuff like that there 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.110
 I still question that would be 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.310
 can be a nice tip well i am i am 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.010
 very curious we will read and thank you 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.770
 well and with that the end of this 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.660
 car week journal content week 43 you read 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.820
 further our big winter test we
