00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:19.430
 operation of the uru web page 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.369
 Province 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.369
 the country 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.079
 and the beach of those on behalf of 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.030
 example just look saline 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.219
 if we click and we would give directly 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.469
 the father of the day the page 'www inguru 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.589
 above all, the subject of 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:46.010
 hello wind usually fails a bit but a 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.769
 wind the truth that almost 100% reliable 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.539
 if you notice here, the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.649
 information from this week's part and 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.649
 a bit next week 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.120
 well pretty good too to see a 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.120
 little the long-term part 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.440
 here in the first place, it usually comes 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.430
 wind information in knots and apart 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.400
 a color scale against more white 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.940
 is the color and indicates that there is a lot 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.940
 less wind 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 just below this we have the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.220
 what would be the wind gust that is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 very good to have it in mind here we have 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.000
 the direction of the wind 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.820
 the height swell in meter is worth remembering 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.420
 that you can always select in 2010 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.210
 the period 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 the direction of the soil the temperature 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.630
 of water 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.210
 keep in mind that this part would be 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.200
 as if we were looking straight ahead 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.880
 Central more harm 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.829
 and here we have what would be the cloudiness 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.829
 High average 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.390
 and just below that not the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.550
 rainfall of the day 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.050
 now we also have a new scale 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.090
 voucher in star 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.370
 so we can also have a little bit of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.190
 orientation of the bathroom that is going to 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.250
 to be made 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 the best way interprets a part of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.940
 hello to me it's always to see a guru to 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.030
 wind issues because since it is very 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.920
 reliable and for swell ground see watch or
