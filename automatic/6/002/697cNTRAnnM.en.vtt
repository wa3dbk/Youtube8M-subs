00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
champions that later than drinking would

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.440 
champions that later than drinking would
work<00:02:36.239> well<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.599> um<00:02:37.370> tristana<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.730> by<00:02:39.120> far

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
work well with um tristana is by far

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.900

like<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.230> best<00:02:40.410> champ<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.430> then<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.730> can

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
like the best champ but then you can

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.740

also<00:02:42.000> get<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:43.549> like<00:02:44.549> short-range<00:02:45.000> 80s<00:02:45.420> like

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
also get it on like short-range 80s like

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.960 
also get it on like short-range 80s like
graves<00:02:46.260> or<00:02:48.980> trying<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.069> think<00:02:50.250> who<00:02:50.459> else<00:02:50.489> has<00:02:50.940> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
really low range I can't see that it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.520 
really low range I can't see that it
will<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.120> pretty<00:02:54.239> decent<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:54.750> going<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.200> be

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
will be pretty decent I'm going to be

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.729 
will be pretty decent I'm going to be
pushes<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.190> range<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.379> what's<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.530> good

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
pushes your range and what's so good

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.440 
pushes your range and what's so good
about<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.280> there's<00:02:59.579> an<00:02:59.730> active<00:03:00.120> which

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
about it is there's an active which

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.750 
about it is there's an active which
deals<00:03:00.959> whoever<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.069> use<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.670> like

passive so yeah I feel like van angry is
like<00:03:12.989> another<00:03:13.500> example<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.930> using<00:03:15.930> their<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
like another example of using their the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.400 
like another example of using their the
ring<00:03:16.829> came<00:03:17.010> on<00:03:17.160> Oh<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.239> an<00:03:18.389> advantage<00:03:18.569> in

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
ring came on Oh is there an advantage in

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
opposed to like getting IE first yeah so

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.610 
opposed to like getting IE first yeah so
blade<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.690> ranking<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.200> lot<00:03:25.470> more

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
blade of the ranking is a lot more

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 
blade of the ranking is a lot more
cheaper<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.430> builds<00:03:26.730> off<00:03:26.940> colors<00:03:27.389> which

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
cheaper and it builds off colors which

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.360 
cheaper and it builds off colors which
is<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.440> most<00:03:28.650> cost<00:03:29.040> effective

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
is one of the most cost effective

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.970 
is one of the most cost effective
