and we'll get right into it
so<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> z<00:00:46.980> 8ol<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.940> za<00:00:48.239> series<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so this is the z 8ol the za series is a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
so this is the z 8ol the za series is a
lot<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> FK<00:00:49.710> series<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.280> shape<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
lot like the FK series and shape as you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
lot like the FK series and shape as you
can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.960> big<00:00:52.140> difference<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> lip

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

can see the big difference is the lip
and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> wing<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.210> either<00:00:54.360> side<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.170> an

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and the wing on either side it's an

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
and the wing on either side it's an
ambidextrous<00:00:55.800> Mouse<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ambidextrous Mouse so you can see it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
ambidextrous Mouse so you can see it
over<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> other<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.309> maybe

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
over here and on the other side maybe

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
over here and on the other side maybe
right<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.680> purpose<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> for

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
right there and the purpose of it is for

that's<00:01:33.450> causing<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.259> able<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that's causing you to not be able to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's causing you to not be able to
drop<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.790> really

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
drop it which is what I really really

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
drop it which is what I really really
like<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.430> hua<00:01:38.759> no<00:01:38.820> switches<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.340> there<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
like the hua no switches so there have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.889 
like the hua no switches so there have
been<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.820> controversy<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> some

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
been some controversy with it some

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
been some controversy with it some
people<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.530> switches<00:01:44.340> but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
people don't really like switches but

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.120 
people don't really like switches but
I'll<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.380> Z<00:01:46.590> 812<00:01:46.950> does<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I'll have you know that the Z 812 does a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
I'll have you know that the Z 812 does a
really<00:01:47.280> good<00:01:47.399> job<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.670> mitigating<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.869> force

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
really good job of mitigating the force

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
really good job of mitigating the force
required<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:51.060> press<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> buttons<00:01:52.140> just

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
required to press the buttons just

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.590 
required to press the buttons just
because<00:01:52.740> your<00:01:52.920> fingers<00:01:53.310> already<00:01:53.700> downward<00:01:54.329> on

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because your fingers already downward on

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240 
because your fingers already downward on
an<00:01:55.020> angle<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.500> soon<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> grip<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> mouse

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
an angle as soon as you grip the mouse

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
an angle as soon as you grip the mouse
so<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.270> easier<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.600> press<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> button

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
so it's a lot easier to press the button

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
so it's a lot easier to press the button
compared<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> something<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.520> again<00:01:59.909> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
compared to something like again that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
compared to something like again that

you see today where I'm kind of fighting

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160

it feels like it never gets stuck in

might<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.390> stuck<00:03:13.600> between<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.110> would<00:03:14.260> be

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
might get stuck between so you would be

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.809 
might get stuck between so you would be
hop<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.680> let's<00:03:14.890> say<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.280> death<00:03:15.459> adder<00:03:15.700> or

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
hop on let's say the death adder or

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.210 
hop on let's say the death adder or
maybe<00:03:16.120> another<00:03:16.989> mouse<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.560> when<00:03:17.950> you're<00:03:18.070> done

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
maybe another mouse and when you're done

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.430 
maybe another mouse and when you're done
the<00:03:18.850> scroll<00:03:19.090> will<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.390> stuck<00:03:19.690> between<00:03:19.900> one

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the scroll will be stuck between one

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.530 
the scroll will be stuck between one
step<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.799> another<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.310> as<00:03:21.940> soon<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.299> touch

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
step in another and as soon as you touch

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
gonna be a second to find my mice I'll

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
gonna be a second to find my mice I'll
put<00:03:43.030> them<00:03:43.120> side-by-side<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.500> can<00:03:44.980> see

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
put them side-by-side and you can see

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.759 
put them side-by-side and you can see
the<00:03:45.370> shape<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.940> size<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.450> me<00:03:46.769> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
the shape and the size of me the

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.509 
the shape and the size of me the
differences<00:03:48.250> between<00:03:48.310> them<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.340> took<00:03:51.459> four

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
differences between them so it took four

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.340 
differences between them so it took four
popular<00:03:52.120> mice<00:03:52.299> here<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.690> put<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.989> necks<00:03:53.200> of

are all shorter than the ergonomic mice
as<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:09.160> would<00:04:09.280> expect<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:10.209> ergonomic

as you would expect the ergonomic
monster<00:04:10.870> was<00:04:10.989> gonna<00:04:11.139> be<00:04:11.230> taller<00:04:11.410> they<00:04:11.650> had

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
monster was gonna be taller they had

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.229 
monster was gonna be taller they had
that<00:04:11.920> little<00:04:12.160> peak<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.670> left<00:04:12.700> side<00:04:13.000> here

that little peak on the left side here

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.569 
that little peak on the left side here
to<00:04:13.480> fit<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> hand<00:04:13.930> if<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.739> look<00:04:14.859> at<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.160> from<00:04:15.370> a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
to fit the hand if you look at it from a

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.090 
to fit the hand if you look at it from a
bird's<00:04:16.090> eye<00:04:16.389> view<00:04:16.419> they're<00:04:17.350> about<00:04:17.560> as<00:04:17.709> level

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
bird's eye view they're about as level

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.380 
bird's eye view they're about as level
as<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.519> would<00:04:18.639> say<00:04:18.850> they<00:04:19.419> could<00:04:19.900> get<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:21.580> EC<00:04:22.210> 1

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
as I would say they could get the EC 1

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.880 
as I would say they could get the EC 1
and<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.690> Razer<00:04:22.900> DeathAdder<00:04:23.229> definitely

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
and the Razer DeathAdder definitely

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.060 
and the Razer DeathAdder definitely
bigger<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:24.729> g3<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.390> definitely

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
bigger the g3 is definitely

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.310 
bigger the g3 is definitely
smaller<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.910> it's<00:04:27.360> around<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.690> same<00:04:27.900> size<00:04:28.110> I

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
smaller and it's around the same size I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.400 
smaller and it's around the same size I
would<00:04:28.440> say<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.740> as<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.980> ec2<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.510> if<00:04:31.140> you're

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
would say it as the ec2 so if you're

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.800 
would say it as the ec2 so if you're
into<00:04:31.770> an<00:04:31.980> ec2<00:04:32.310> kind<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:32.940> size<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.390> would<00:04:33.510> say<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
into an ec2 kind of size I would say the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.350 
into an ec2 kind of size I would say the
za<00:04:33.990> 12<00:04:34.590> was<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.980> great<00:04:35.370> pickup<00:04:35.700> if<00:04:36.090> you're<00:04:36.210> into

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
za 12 was a great pickup if you're into

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.760 
za 12 was a great pickup if you're into
a<00:04:36.420> smaller<00:04:36.840> Mouse

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
a smaller Mouse

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.030 
a smaller Mouse
definitely<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.090> za<00:04:39.750> 13<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:40.890> use

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
definitely the za 13 so if you use

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.980 
definitely the za 13 so if you use
something<00:04:41.250> like<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.610> eg<00:04:41.910> 303<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.840> like

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
something like the eg 303 and you like

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.860 
something like the eg 303 and you like
that<00:04:43.140> small<00:04:43.530> feel<00:04:43.800> definitely<00:04:44.670> try<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.060> c8<00:04:45.450> 13

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
that small feel definitely try the c8 13

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.980 
that small feel definitely try the c8 13
the<00:04:46.830> za<00:04:47.250> 11<00:04:47.760> would<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:47.940> better<00:04:48.180> if<00:04:48.600> you're<00:04:48.780> used

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the za 11 would be better if you're used

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.890 
the za 11 would be better if you're used
to<00:04:49.200> bigger<00:04:49.650> um<00:04:50.040> grip<00:04:50.190> myosin<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.670> got<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.000> EC

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
to bigger um grip myosin you got the EC

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.260 
to bigger um grip myosin you got the EC

right they're a little bit bigger than
the<00:04:57.300> za<00:04:57.450> 12<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.050> busy<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.320> Levin<00:04:58.680> might<00:04:58.860> be<00:04:58.980> a

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
the za 12 so busy a Levin might be a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.310 
the za 12 so busy a Levin might be a
better<00:04:59.160> choice<00:04:59.370> for<00:04:59.430> you

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
better choice for you
