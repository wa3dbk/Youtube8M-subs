00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.319 
recommend a lot of um comic artists and
creators<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.159> make<00:02:20.189> it<00:02:20.430> exactly<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.120> size

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
creators to make it exactly this size

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.080 
creators to make it exactly this size
