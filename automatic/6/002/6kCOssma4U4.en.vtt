this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.730> my<00:00:02.909> simple<00:00:03.360> setup<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:04.170> testing<00:00:04.589> GPS

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
this is my simple setup for testing GPS

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.030 
this is my simple setup for testing GPS
interference<00:00:06.240> from<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> small<00:00:07.410> cameras<00:00:07.859> were

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
interference from the small cameras were

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.480 
interference from the small cameras were
using<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.670> our<00:00:08.849> models<00:00:09.590> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.740> my<00:00:10.889> test<00:00:11.190> ring

at the bottom of the screen the signal
level<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.400> longer<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> bar<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> stronger

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
level the longer the bar the stronger

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.010 
level the longer the bar the stronger
the<00:00:30.779> signal<00:00:32.239> what<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.780> now<00:00:33.989> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the signal what I'm going to do now is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
the signal what I'm going to do now is
I'll<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.070> couple<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> cameras<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.880> just

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
I'll take a couple of cameras and just

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
I'll take a couple of cameras and just
put<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.600> underneath<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
put them underneath it if you have a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.400 
put them underneath it if you have a
look<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> still<00:00:39.270> picture<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.899> rig<00:00:40.140> it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
look at the still picture of my rig it's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
look at the still picture of my rig it's
about<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.860> same<00:00:41.010> distance<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> camera<00:00:41.969> would

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
about the same distance the camera would

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
about the same distance the camera would
be<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.340> 350<00:00:45.410> first<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.649> we'll<00:00:47.010> try<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
be on the 350 first of all we'll try the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
be on the 350 first of all we'll try the
mobius<00:00:47.940> camera<00:00:50.449> I'm<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> turn<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> on

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
mobius camera I'm going to turn it on

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:02.250 
mobius camera I'm going to turn it on
and<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:53.579> record

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.039 

as<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:03.010> take<00:01:03.219> it<00:01:03.399> close<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.789> the<00:01:04.030> GPS<00:01:04.600> you'll<00:01:04.839> see

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
as I take it close to the GPS you'll see

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.270 
as I take it close to the GPS you'll see
that<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.320> signal<00:01:05.710> goes<00:01:05.860> down<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.979> put<00:01:12.159> it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
that the signal goes down if I put it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.490 
that the signal goes down if I put it
underneath<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.729> GPS<00:01:13.330> in<00:01:13.689> about<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.320> same

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
underneath the GPS in about the same

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.469 
underneath the GPS in about the same
place<00:01:14.560> as<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.399> would<00:01:15.549> be<00:01:15.580> on<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.979> 350<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
place as it would be on the 350 the

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.450 
place as it would be on the 350 the
satellite<00:01:19.930> signals<00:01:20.350> are<00:01:20.500> still<00:01:20.740> present<00:01:21.009> but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
satellite signals are still present but

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.719 
satellite signals are still present but
not<00:01:21.850> as<00:01:22.060> strong<00:01:22.890> you'll<00:01:23.890> see<00:01:24.100> as<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.280> take<00:01:24.549> it

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
not as strong you'll see as I take it

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:35.370 
not as strong you'll see as I take it
away<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.780> those<00:01:25.960> signals<00:01:26.350> come<00:01:26.619> up<00:01:34.080> now<00:01:35.080> if<00:01:35.259> I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
away that those signals come up now if I

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.169 
away that those signals come up now if I
put<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> Mobius<00:01:36.159> back<00:01:38.520> underneath<00:01:39.520> in<00:01:39.909> about

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
put the Mobius back underneath in about

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.760 
put the Mobius back underneath in about
the<00:01:40.360> same<00:01:40.539> positions<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.200> would<00:01:41.350> normally<00:01:41.530> be

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
the same positions it would normally be

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.770 
the same positions it would normally be
and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.600> add<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:44.580> battery<00:01:45.580> pack<00:01:45.789> again<00:01:46.390> at

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
and then I add a battery pack again at

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.419 
and then I add a battery pack again at
about<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> same<00:01:47.200> place<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.890> would<00:01:48.039> be<00:01:48.190> in<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
about the same place it would be in the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:58.320 
about the same place it would be in the
350<00:01:56.399> you'll<00:01:57.399> see<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.909> battery<00:01:58.299> pack

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
350 you'll see that the battery pack

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.630 
350 you'll see that the battery pack
offers<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:59.140> wee<00:01:59.440> bit<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.799> screening<00:02:00.310> but<00:02:00.429> not

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
offers a a wee bit of screening but not

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.779 
offers a a wee bit of screening but not
a<00:02:00.670> lot<00:02:01.740> again<00:02:02.740> if<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:02.979> take<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.340> camera<00:02:03.700> out

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
a lot again if I take the camera out

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.160 
a lot again if I take the camera out
from<00:02:04.060> underneath<00:02:04.330> you'll<00:02:04.690> see<00:02:04.929> that<00:02:05.049> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
from underneath you'll see that the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.240 
from underneath you'll see that the
signals<00:02:05.560> will<00:02:05.770> come<00:02:05.950> up<00:02:06.100> slightly<00:02:06.399> a<00:02:11.250> simple

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
signals will come up slightly a simple

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.820 
signals will come up slightly a simple
fix<00:02:12.489> for<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.849> Mobius<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.720> put<00:02:14.319> around<00:02:14.440> it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
fix for the Mobius is to put around it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.010 
fix for the Mobius is to put around it
some<00:02:15.069> screening<00:02:15.700> again<00:02:16.450> I'm<00:02:16.599> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.870> move

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
some screening again I'm going to move

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.110 
some screening again I'm going to move
the<00:02:17.170> battery<00:02:17.530> away<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> Mobius<00:02:21.120> I'll

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the battery away and on the Mobius I'll

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.000 
the battery away and on the Mobius I'll
put<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> screen<00:02:22.870> around<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.620> made<00:02:23.800> from

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
put a screen around it just made from

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.130 
put a screen around it just made from
aluminium<00:02:24.190> foil<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.480> camera<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.870> still

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
aluminium foil the camera is still

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.339 
aluminium foil the camera is still
recording<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.360> i'll<00:02:34.540> place<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.840> underneath

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
recording and i'll place it underneath

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.600 
recording and i'll place it underneath
the<00:02:35.470> GPS<00:02:36.099> now

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.000 

when<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> battery<00:02:44.120> pack<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.570> refitted<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
when the battery pack is refitted the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.950 
when the battery pack is refitted the
interference<00:02:46.700> will<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.120> more<00:02:47.390> screening

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
interference will have more screening

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.570 
interference will have more screening
from<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.770> camera<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.580> GPS<00:02:50.150> receiver<00:02:51.580> so

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
from the camera to the GPS receiver so

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.790 
from the camera to the GPS receiver so
for<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> Mobius<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.360> very<00:02:53.600> simple<00:02:54.020> trick<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.770> to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
for a Mobius a very simple trick is to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.650 
for a Mobius a very simple trick is to
just<00:02:55.070> use<00:02:55.280> aluminium<00:02:55.490> foil<00:02:56.120> around<00:02:56.330> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
just use aluminium foil around the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.280 
just use aluminium foil around the
camera<00:02:58.180> I'll<00:02:59.180> show<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.510> now<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> couple<00:03:00.110> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
camera I'll show you now a couple of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.530 
camera I'll show you now a couple of
other<00:03:00.440> cameras<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:03.160> as<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.820> move<00:03:05.000> around<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
other cameras I have as I move around in

other cameras I have as I move around in
the<00:03:05.570> workshop<00:03:06.080> here<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.410> signals<00:03:06.770> are

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
the workshop here the signals are

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.620 
the workshop here the signals are
changing<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> little<00:03:07.580> bit<00:03:07.730> I'm<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:08.330> going<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
changing a little bit I'm now going to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.870 
changing a little bit I'm now going to
use<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.200> cheap<00:03:09.470> camera<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.310> i<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.580> used

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
use a cheap camera that i have used

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.000 
use a cheap camera that i have used
before<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.770> models<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:14.360> turn<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.750> on

still affected but not as bad take it

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.820 
still affected but not as bad take it
out<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.650> signals<00:04:18.010> come<00:04:18.220> up<00:04:18.370> again<00:04:22.830> the

from<00:04:26.830> normal<00:04:27.280> cooking<00:04:27.850> foil<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:28.930> what<00:04:29.170> I<00:04:29.200> find

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
from normal cooking foil but what I find

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.920 
from normal cooking foil but what I find
with<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.950> normal<00:04:30.280> cooking<00:04:30.520> foil<00:04:30.970> is<00:04:31.420> it<00:04:31.810> it's

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
with the normal cooking foil is it it's

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.500 
with the normal cooking foil is it it's
a<00:04:32.020> little<00:04:32.290> bit<00:04:32.380> fragile<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:33.130> work<00:04:33.340> with<00:04:33.610> so

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
a little bit fragile to work with so

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.040 
a little bit fragile to work with so
what<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.720> do<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.830> put<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.430> some<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.810> clear

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
what I do is I put on it some just clear

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.710 
what I do is I put on it some just clear
adhesive<00:04:38.350> tape<00:04:39.040> I've<00:04:39.550> got<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.150> wider<00:04:40.360> tape

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
adhesive tape I've got the wider tape

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.190 
adhesive tape I've got the wider tape
here<00:04:41.050> makes<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.920> easier<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.310> work<00:04:42.580> with<00:04:42.640> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
here makes it easier to work with and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:05:04.800 
here makes it easier to work with and
all<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.230> need<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.560> do<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:47.560> put<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:48.010> on<00:04:48.190> one<00:04:48.400> side

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.480 

and<00:05:06.460> rub<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.580> down<00:05:08.650> difficult<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:09.949> on<00:05:09.979> here

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
and rub it down difficult to see on here

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.550 
and rub it down difficult to see on here
but<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.150> now<00:05:11.389> has<00:05:11.569> made<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.930> far<00:05:12.199> stronger

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
but that now has made it far stronger

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.240 
but that now has made it far stronger
than<00:05:12.949> the<00:05:13.280> original<00:05:13.789> an<00:05:13.909> aluminum<00:05:14.300> foil<00:05:14.659> was

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
than the original an aluminum foil was

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.580 
than the original an aluminum foil was
as<00:05:16.250> an<00:05:16.520> example<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.930> can<00:05:18.110> see<00:05:18.349> that<00:05:18.379> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
as an example you can see that the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.040 
as an example you can see that the
aluminium<00:05:18.860> foil<00:05:19.400> where<00:05:19.639> they<00:05:19.789> tape<00:05:20.659> is<00:05:20.870> not

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
aluminium foil where they tape is not

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.580 
aluminium foil where they tape is not
present<00:05:21.530> easily<00:05:22.190> tears<00:05:23.020> but<00:05:24.020> where<00:05:24.229> I've<00:05:24.379> got

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
present easily tears but where I've got

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.070 
present easily tears but where I've got
the<00:05:24.740> tape<00:05:24.949> on<00:05:25.159> it<00:05:25.190> it's<00:05:26.060> very<00:05:26.300> difficult<00:05:26.569> to

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the tape on it it's very difficult to

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.619 
the tape on it it's very difficult to
tear<00:05:27.319> it<00:05:28.180> makes<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.360> much<00:05:29.509> stronger<00:05:31.360> yes<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
tear it makes it much stronger yes the
