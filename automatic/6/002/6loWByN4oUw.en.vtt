00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.770
 welcome to meinl wittstock 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.330
 here from the stechert vip lounge with me 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.650
 sit the cogisum s.nico nice first 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.950
 that currently have taken servus 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.360
 emblem it was for us on the spectator 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.950
 tribune yes already difficult yes it was 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.939
 very warm how does that feel on the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.790
 place to the felt temperature 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.900
 truth like so it was pretty 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.310
 I think something completely googles 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.770
 first bandage out of his shadow 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.600
 could throw a clear at the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 Temperatures are very heavy 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.150
 air is a bit early out of the box 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.770
 it is a bit cooler 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.290
 I guess this one has us 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.340
 noted the end of the first half was 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.360
 it must be a bit weaker with it 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 we let the ball go but not 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.470
 more played so much forward 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 but of course you have to be a professional athlete 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.340
 you have to deal with it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.510
 despite the high temperatures you have 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.970
 you started like the fire department in 11 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.190
 minutes 20 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.630
 was that planned I say wanted to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.940
 i just wanted to play as we wanted 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.920
 Of course, the opponent's opponent early on 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.659
 Press and the balls in front in their 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 half win and that's us in the beginning 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.509
 very well done and I think that has 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.790
 Equally paid is important 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.829
 of course for the fans that we 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.420
 Two fast gates are now shooting in the 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.640
 first season is the first 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.860
 homecoming a whole city breathes on 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.180
 a season without home win feels like 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.980
 look at that for you, you're new in 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.540
 fÃ¼rth but all now with about 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.960
 experience the first victory in the yard too 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.970
 celebrate 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.430
 yes you have noticed in any case 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.510
 that the club and especially the fans 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.250
 pretty much redeemed 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.470
 but it also has the Glasgow 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.850
 already noticed that the fans 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.560
 right over that it's back in here 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.180
 go off the court and that the gates fall 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 and on our gate 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.690
 I guess that really good for 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.560
 the club you're only in for us 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.570
 they did not record 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 very good very good team 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.140
 you do not need to say that's it 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.490
 so great troupe pretty young troupe 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.979
 and that suits me well 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.950
 now it goes on friday on the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.840
 regeneration pretty short five days what 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.340
 make her to regenerate because of the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.130
 Temperatures should stay as it is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.049
 make active regeneration so look 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.190
 Of course we will be the monument to the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.990
 Temperatures are also a bit faster 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.430
 may be shut down tomorrow 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.689
 cycling loose or something like that 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.439
 attaches to the player who lasts longer 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.119
 have played 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.129
 and yes I think then how can we 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.420
 on friday full throttle you are 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.640
 her to the victory in the season started the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.850
 have one 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.190
 friday zero to zero played there wide 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.420
 what is the goal? 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.950
 yeah because even as we naturally want 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.330
 get the three points that is that is 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.010
 I think you just start each game 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.490
 play in and want the victory in victory 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.560
 pick up 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 I think I played quite well 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.580
 on friday I think it was 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.110
 but we can still hold against it 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.910
 and get the three points 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.840
 for that we wish you for that wish me 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.100
 of course, the team good luck 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.530
 nice that so soon after the game continues 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.540
 are here in the vip lounge in the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.370
 Steers vip lounge at aldi talk and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.080
 So we say goodbye and wish 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.400
 Of course, a nice rest 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.400
