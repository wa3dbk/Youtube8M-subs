3d<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> next<00:01:15.330> option<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:16.049> here

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
3d which is this next option down here

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
3d which is this next option down here
basically<00:01:17.490> causes<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.299> Photoshop

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
basically causes all the Photoshop

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.480 
basically causes all the Photoshop
layers<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.439> viewed<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> perspective

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
layers to be viewed from the perspective

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
of the compositions camera and what that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.810 
of the compositions camera and what that
means<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> any<00:01:25.020> 3d

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
means is that if you have any 3d

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
means is that if you have any 3d
elements<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:26.970> Photoshop<00:01:27.540> document<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it's going to look through the camera in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
it's going to look through the camera in
your<00:01:31.320> composition<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.310> After<00:01:32.850> Effects<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.900> see

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
your composition in After Effects to see
