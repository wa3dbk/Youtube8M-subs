00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
ok now we're going to a compression test

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.969 
ok now we're going to a compression test
on<00:00:04.840> this<00:00:04.899> motor<00:00:05.109> now<00:00:05.260> it's<00:00:05.439> running<00:00:05.680> it's

three and four you're going to
disconnect<00:00:12.370> the<00:00:12.610> harness<00:00:12.790> on<00:00:13.120> them

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.790

okay next we're going to move all the

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.930 
okay next we're going to move all the
spark<00:00:30.100> plugs<00:00:30.340> on<00:00:31.000> all<00:00:31.270> four<00:00:31.570> cylinders

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540 

they're<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.150> be<00:00:37.210> hot<00:00:38.340> they're<00:00:39.340> going<00:00:39.460> to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
they're going to be hot they're going to

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.510 
they're going to be hot they're going to
be<00:00:39.640> hot<00:00:41.430> melt<00:00:42.430> glue<00:00:42.700> or<00:00:43.060> something<00:00:44.400> okay<00:00:45.400> next

be hot melt glue or something okay next

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.890 
be hot melt glue or something okay next
we're<00:00:45.730> going<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:45.880> hook<00:00:46.000> our<00:00:46.150> depression<00:00:46.600> hose

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
we're going to hook our depression hose

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.690 
we're going to hook our depression hose
up<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.200> number<00:00:47.410> one<00:00:47.530> cylinder<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:51.460> hand

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
up the number one cylinder just hand

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.400 
up the number one cylinder just hand
tighten<00:00:51.970> it<00:00:52.150> it's<00:00:52.750> not<00:00:52.840> going<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.110> be<00:00:53.170> torqued

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
tighten it it's not going to be torqued

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.810 
tighten it it's not going to be torqued
down<00:00:53.500> next<00:00:54.190> we'll<00:00:54.280> hook<00:00:54.370> our<00:00:54.489> compression

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
down next we'll hook our compression

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.549 
down next we'll hook our compression
gauge<00:00:55.059> up<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.720> hose<00:00:58.230> okay<00:00:59.230> next<00:00:59.379> we're

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
gauge up to the hose okay next we're

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:09.800 
gauge up to the hose okay next we're
going<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.710> move<00:00:59.860> our<00:00:59.949> fuel<00:01:00.160> pump<00:01:00.339> fuse

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 

and<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> disconnect<00:01:10.979> our

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and we're going to disconnect our

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.710 
and we're going to disconnect our
chemical<00:01:11.909> sensor<00:01:12.180> plug<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:15.450> we're<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
chemical sensor plug now we're going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
chemical sensor plug now we're going to
get<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.960> cart<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> start<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
get in the cart and start it you want to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
get in the cart and start it you want to
turn<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> car<00:01:17.970> over<00:01:18.210> five<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.869> six

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
turn the car over five or six

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
turn the car over five or six
revolutions<00:01:19.289> with<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.189> gas<00:01:20.460> pedal<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
revolutions with the gas pedal all the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.630 
revolutions with the gas pedal all the
way<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> floor<00:01:27.170> can<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.350> 165<00:01:29.070> psi<00:01:29.580> on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
way to the floor can we have 165 psi on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.139 
way to the floor can we have 165 psi on
this<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.000> standard<00:01:30.929> is<00:01:31.159> 150<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.030> good

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
this one standard is 150 so we're good

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.190 
this one standard is 150 so we're good
on<00:01:33.179> this<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.450> will<00:01:33.899> go<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:34.079> number<00:01:34.350> two<00:01:34.560> now

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
on this one will go to number two now

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.550 
on this one will go to number two now
okay<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.500> release<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> air<00:01:38.070> out

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
okay you want to release the air out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
okay you want to release the air out
we'll<00:01:40.560> hook<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:40.770> number<00:01:41.009> two<00:01:41.039> it's<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> exact

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we'll hook up number two it's the exact

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
we'll hook up number two it's the exact
same<00:01:42.090> procedure<00:01:42.600> okay<00:01:43.440> now<00:01:43.560> we'll<00:01:43.679> do<00:01:43.740> the

same procedure okay now we'll do the
same<00:01:44.039> thing<00:01:44.250> gas<00:01:44.520> pedal<00:01:44.819> all<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.209> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
same thing gas pedal all way to the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
same thing gas pedal all way to the
floor<00:01:45.420> five<00:01:46.049> six<00:01:46.319> revolutions<00:01:51.740> okay<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
floor five six revolutions okay we have

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.589 
floor five six revolutions okay we have
one<00:01:52.979> hundred<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.369> sixty<00:01:53.610> psi<00:01:53.789> on<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
one hundred and sixty psi on this one so

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:56.600 
one hundred and sixty psi on this one so
it's<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:54.929> as<00:01:55.080> well<00:01:55.229> there's<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> number

it's good as well there's on to number
three<00:02:00.950> we<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:02.069> 160<00:02:02.729> psi<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.569> as

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
three we have 160 psi on this one as

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.839 
three we have 160 psi on this one as
well<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.099> one's<00:02:05.280> good<00:02:05.429> we'll<00:02:05.610> move<00:02:05.700> on
