this<00:00:20.060> is<00:00:20.180> still<00:00:20.390> flying<00:00:20.660> well<00:00:21.439> we<00:00:21.590> don't<00:00:21.740> have

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
this is still flying well we don't have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.290 
this is still flying well we don't have
a<00:00:21.920> Paulo<00:00:22.189> at<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.550> moment<00:00:22.849> so<00:00:23.060> we<00:00:23.180> are

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
a Paulo at the moment so we are

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.819 
a Paulo at the moment so we are
disgusting<00:00:23.750> without<00:00:23.990> Taylor<00:00:24.259> how<00:00:24.439> much<00:00:24.619> time

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
disgusting without Taylor how much time

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.069 
disgusting without Taylor how much time
it<00:00:24.980> will<00:00:25.130> like<00:00:25.489> right<00:00:26.060> now<00:00:26.210> I'm<00:00:26.390> flying<00:00:26.630> for<00:00:26.869> 12

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
it will like right now I'm flying for 12

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.290 
it will like right now I'm flying for 12
minutes<00:00:27.289> almost<00:00:27.710> more<00:00:28.550> than<00:00:28.579> 12<00:00:28.939> minutes<00:00:29.060> now

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
minutes almost more than 12 minutes now

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.420 
minutes almost more than 12 minutes now
let<00:00:30.230> me<00:00:30.289> teach<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.590> simple<00:00:30.739> thing<00:00:31.130> how<00:00:31.369> to

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
let me teach you a simple thing how to

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.270 
let me teach you a simple thing how to
fly<00:00:31.759> target<00:00:32.300> lock<00:00:32.509> manually<00:00:33.260> okay<00:00:33.890> which<00:00:34.160> is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
fly target lock manually okay which is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.100 
fly target lock manually okay which is
very<00:00:34.370> very<00:00:34.790> simple<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.660> first<00:00:35.899> thing<00:00:36.050> you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
very very simple the first thing you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.549 
very very simple the first thing you
need<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.290> do<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.710> set<00:00:37.100> your<00:00:37.309> NASA<00:00:37.610> or<00:00:38.059> wkm<00:00:38.960> yaw

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
need to do is set your NASA or wkm yaw

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.670 
need to do is set your NASA or wkm yaw
rate<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.250> 135<00:00:40.820> percent<00:00:41.300> or<00:00:41.450> whatever<00:00:42.170> suits

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
rate to 135 percent or whatever suits

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.850 
rate to 135 percent or whatever suits
you<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.129> then<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:43.910> trick<00:00:44.149> is<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.899> match<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
you and then the trick is to match the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.000 
you and then the trick is to match the
yaw<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.510> aileron<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.170> certain<00:00:48.860> direction

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
yaw and the aileron in certain direction

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.310 
yaw and the aileron in certain direction
and<00:00:49.520> your<00:00:50.150> camera<00:00:50.480> will<00:00:50.630> be<00:00:50.750> facing<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
and your camera will be facing in the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.680 
and your camera will be facing in the
same<00:00:51.350> target<00:00:52.040> on<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.520> same<00:00:52.700> target<00:00:52.910> all<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
same target on the same target all the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.479 
same target on the same target all the
time<00:00:53.899> while<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.260> quad<00:00:54.470> or<00:00:54.710> your<00:00:55.100> multi<00:00:55.370> rotor

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
time while the quad or your multi rotor

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.340 
time while the quad or your multi rotor
will<00:00:55.730> be<00:00:55.820> hovering<00:00:55.970> around<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.989> creates

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
will be hovering around it it creates

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.770 
will be hovering around it it creates
very<00:00:57.649> very<00:00:57.950> nice<00:00:58.190> videos<00:00:58.880> very<00:00:59.120> nice<00:00:59.420> videos

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
very very nice videos very nice videos

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.360 
very very nice videos very nice videos
so<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.200> can<00:01:00.290> do<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.649> inwards<00:01:01.130> or<00:01:01.309> outwards

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
so you can do it inwards or outwards

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.460 
so you can do it inwards or outwards
both<00:01:02.000> way<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.510> camera<00:01:02.750> looking<00:01:02.989> inwards<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
both way the camera looking inwards and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.920 
both way the camera looking inwards and
outwards<00:01:03.590> so<00:01:04.040> cloven<00:01:04.640> for<00:01:04.850> now<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.329> court<00:01:05.810> is

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
outwards so cloven for now the court is

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.899 
outwards so cloven for now the court is
looking<00:01:06.079> at<00:01:06.350> us<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.009> assume<00:01:07.579> there<00:01:07.790> is<00:01:07.880> a

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
looking at us so we assume there is a

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.080 
looking at us so we assume there is a
subject<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> center<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.369> accordingly

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
subject in the center so accordingly

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.590 
subject in the center so accordingly
whatever<00:01:11.630> your<00:01:12.310> left<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.430> right<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.640> want<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.270> can

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
whatever your left to right I want I can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.420 
whatever your left to right I want I can
choose<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:16.490> can<00:01:17.180> you're<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:18.430> little

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
choose that and I can you're a little

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.959 
choose that and I can you're a little
bit<00:01:19.670> of<00:01:20.829> elevator<00:01:21.829> up<00:01:22.130> like<00:01:22.490> forward

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
bit of elevator up like forward

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.879 
bit of elevator up like forward
direction<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.429> then<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:25.459> will<00:01:25.759> match<00:01:25.999> the<00:01:26.359> yaw

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
direction and then I will match the yaw

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:32.620 
direction and then I will match the yaw
Eller<00:01:27.889> on<00:01:28.249> an<00:01:28.880> elevator<00:01:29.889> and<00:01:30.889> you<00:01:31.249> can<00:01:31.549> see<00:01:31.789> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
Eller on an elevator and you can see the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.039 
Eller on an elevator and you can see the
machine<00:01:32.779> is<00:01:33.170> doing

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
machine is doing

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.459 
machine is doing
the<00:01:34.590> target<00:01:35.039> lock<00:01:35.219> motion<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> can

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
the target lock motion so you can

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.169 
the target lock motion so you can
increase<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> decrease<00:01:38.219> the<00:01:38.729> circle

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
increase and decrease the circle

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.830 
increase and decrease the circle
manually<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:41.130> double<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.240> actually<00:01:42.450> have

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
manually so double you can actually have

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.529 
manually so double you can actually have
this<00:01:43.079> feature<00:01:43.789> but<00:01:44.789> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
this feature but if you want to do it

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.039 
this feature but if you want to do it
manually<00:01:45.929> it's<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.159> too<00:01:47.399> simple<00:01:47.899> all<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
manually it's just too simple all you

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
manually it's just too simple all you
need<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.289> do<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> match<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.420> sticks<00:01:51.710> your<00:01:52.710> LR

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
need to do is match the sticks your LR

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.870 
need to do is match the sticks your LR
on<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.789> elevator<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> see

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
on and elevator and you can see

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.419 
on and elevator and you can see
beautiful<00:01:56.880> circle<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.039> do<00:01:59.159> left

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
beautiful circle so you can do left

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.730 
beautiful circle so you can do left
circles<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.209> right<00:02:00.450> circles<00:02:00.959> depending<00:02:01.259> upon

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
circles or right circles depending upon

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.270 
circles or right circles depending upon
your<00:02:02.069> choice

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
your choice

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.360 
your choice
vodka<00:02:05.280> legacy<00:02:09.410> actually<00:02:10.410> wait<00:02:10.799> a<00:02:10.829> moment

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
vodka legacy actually wait a moment

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.930 
vodka legacy actually wait a moment
I<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:12.410> see<00:02:13.410> iris<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.040> flying<00:02:14.310> see

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.150 

so<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:18.110> short<00:02:18.530> circle<00:02:18.980> very

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so this is a very short circle very

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660 
so this is a very short circle very
little<00:02:19.970> radius<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.100> want<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.550> can

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
little radius and if I want I can

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.780 
little radius and if I want I can
increase<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> radius<00:02:24.100> accordingly<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.610> means

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
increase the radius accordingly it means

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.460 
increase the radius accordingly it means
a<00:02:25.880> little<00:02:26.000> bit<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.330> practice<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.290> can

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
a little bit of practice and you can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.510 
a little bit of practice and you can
actually<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
actually do it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:39.309 
actually do it
