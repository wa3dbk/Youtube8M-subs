 rich and to be able to take advantage of all those recipes that surely you have but 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.910

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.069

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.769
 can get tired ofer nails and tortures in dietary quotes like 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 direct bases 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.310
 you are going to use the container that have non-stick 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.400
 t t pans and others and what else you have one but a pharmacy when some 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.010
 droplets a droplet 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 I know I want to brush with a serna brush, do not you think 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.920
 with the plastic 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.129
 in las vegas this is an option 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.729
 the other option is to remove it from the fire please do not dubric me there 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.140
 kosor of heat enough hit to russia vita slowly from gestar that does not have 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 different oils with different flavors 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 some even flavored butter 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
 I would incorporate the pieces of food that have getaria headquarters 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.149
 or say decades 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.509
 you're going to leave it lying on high fire so that the little piece of cloth is reformed around and in that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.890
 moment passed 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 temperature 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.229
 n you are going to put a little bit of each eye of water in this way it is going to end 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 cooking 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.570
 I was going to be a piano violin 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.510
 inside the other option that I'm going to give you now that you can cook 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.980
 we all good beating 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.610
 the couple that a fundamental advantage is that it organizes this fair where 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.250
 using up and that in no way 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.270
 only affect so much it would be good that the 15 landed maybe with some charge 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.720
 flavored to lubricate what is present 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240
 as for the oven 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.670
 the important thing is that you use some kind of iraq assad or source too 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 once before yesterday the better 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.750
 brush stroke also by oil eye louvre face with vegetable dew such as each 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.319
 dawn with the pan 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.399
 and to prevent it from sticking to give a little moisture to the food 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.389
 olives has 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.479
 place 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.550
 before putting the meat deposit egg the other food 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.239
 alcorcón are d 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.249
 the second serve can be alone can also have an aggregate of 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.360
 in calabases everything down from the deposit of these until prepared 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.659
 it can also be back yes 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.540
 tomato slices 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.400
 carrots can expose cut fennel all this what you want to avoid is that you 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.009
 complain that a flavor arrives 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.749
 a lot of magic eye 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.259
 then bosh with all this after claw base a little broth to 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:47.429
 give unit and this will replace the oil and wine you can also do 1 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.810
 or the other with both 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.280
 then add important water is that during cooking 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.920
 you are going to replenish the water run you connect by throwing oil so we 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 you do not need to stick and in this way you will find what is attached 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.629
 very rich food and also a kiss not necessarily 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.569
 he has to be a writer 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.139
 because you will inform and aesthetics 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.379
 I know I'm here 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.449
 the microwave at night another ally of your diet because 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.339
 because you do not need oil because you do not need to put terraces according to the type 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.819
 of 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.979
 Preparing you to do with special forces with recipients 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.149
 specials you can organize and so chance 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.339
 a meal his dog 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.699
 although it goes through 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.519
 be careful with the left 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.439
 mike conley to study and have the purpose I want them 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.150
 those wells have a lot of added and see how far they are giving us 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.560
 permanently so that it does not dry itself to be careful 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.919
 remember this 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.489
 for clear a cooking power bonds or the boiled meat a boiled vegetable and 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.690
 to be able to incorporate all the nutrients 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.080
 What you have to do is use a small amount of water to introduce the 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.190
 food with you want is that small amount of water that is sleeping 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.880
 because if the lack of cold water is going to lose many more nutrients 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.739
 It would be wrong unless you want to use it later 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.909
 all that liquid to make some opa 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.380
 or some sauce 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.930
 As for the steam it's going to be that I want to give you less amount of nutrients 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.549
 that the boil in general 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.289
 and the same thing would happen 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.720
 with the pressure cooker 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.990
 because I approached much less time 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.500
 what I want you to have 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.510
 awarded when seasoned your salad because I tell you this as usual 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.410
 is that one of the young saladillense because he did not lose weight because people 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.270
 it's with the salad I'm going to show you a rule you get scared that maybe in one 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.120
 He says 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.840
 a little bit of oil hits will calculate all the oil people who dates 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.660
 recent engineering to two or three ribs 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.490
 not 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.229
 at 6 o'clock in a different way 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.120
 opas a corner 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.380
 you can eat only one teaspoon size this oil 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.490
 the opponent part as the made this teaspoon the salad is drilled 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.459
 you're going to put a percent bounded in a car will affect 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.590
 for example lemon juice vinegar whatever you want you just add 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.960
 salt pepper the condiments you want and just there when you have 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.249
 all the mixture 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.749
 wolf will be incorporated into the room this way bush you will be able to mix it was going to 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.120
 stay totally 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.490
 another option 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.759
 to squeeze rich salads and more 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.129
 is that you can do 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.029
 a said a mixture of white cheese segurexpo let's take advantage and we're going to 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.469
 use the same jar 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.870
 we can get home 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.040
 someday 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.729
 that happens for example in this way 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.469
 we can add it 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:50.789
 a little bit 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.259
 little house rest in this case we can add a little more in 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:56.869
 is 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:58.589
 we can add it 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.930
 some by the way, we do not propose you to choose 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.900
 to expose that put more salt 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.469
 we put pepper 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:12.340
 Latinos well and that way we can spice up the salad 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.309
 and another option for all these days is something that I'm going to show you here 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.189

 zannini saint naptime and are the famous crudités offensively for that 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:29.639
 reasons are to support rods and then have a tenacious prosecutor to

 a moment where people come to take care of themselves 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.560
