00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 dreams what kind of nonsense she just said 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.910
 this video is a recommendation here any my 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 character brain because no one 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 guarantees its the fact that I touched 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 privates one of the listed today 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.029
 books this summer but I would like to believe in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 the best so let's start in principle 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 to everything that you see next you can 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 I have another list of books 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.590

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 this world that would very much like to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.350

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.939
 Daphne du Maurier she is not much immersed 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799

 Well, my cousin Rachel interested 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.720

 there is death and love 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.439
 murder in general, everything I love 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.979
 the next book that would like to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.380
 read 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 this summer is like an autobiography 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 ellen degeneres services on killing this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.189
 something like a pass on the inn walls and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 again jokes life stories 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.150
 like look at me i'm so funny 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.159
 listened to me on television worked 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 beaches on the pier of money but I'm the same 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.810
 simple person ok you really want her 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.729
 I hope she read deliver me 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.649
 any pleasure because in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 joke principle ellen degeneres 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.369
 and I really like her show further in my 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.430
 shakespeare's list is king lire and the storm 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.100
 really want to read because they 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.619
 are on my list and on books list 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.990
 and queens and clearly the Shakespeare project 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.250
 in my opinion, since I’m not called 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.440
 they read kings 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 no storm and hope ever do it 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.860
 and turn with would hurt this summer in that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.590
 that while I am clearly following my rule 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.630
 Porshik first a month and I hope I will continue 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.850
 further on my list here is a book which 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.460
 I would like to read closer to August 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.730
 because in August a movie comes out if 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.800
 I will stay on the book Gale Forman 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 and as far as I understand it is unique 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.320
 kogel form which is published funny it 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.200
 Russian language and movie trailer me very 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.840
 liked despite the fact that I do not like 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.730
 not really 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.650
 topic because i'm starting to carry a bunch 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.970
 everyones life and this one 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.610
 it was only sad and sad 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.709
 and stuff like that, but I already started 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.290
 read this book not much lasted 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.690
 literally probably 20 pages hope 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.880
 by August I will finish reading because she is quite 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 very thin and really would like to 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.320
 read it before the film to compare 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.540
 Further into the treasury of books of the genre I was sobbing 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.170
 which head came added about what 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 angels are silent becky fitzpatrick 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.520
 also something that makes noise 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.019
 I don't know foreign lips 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.790
 who have not heard of this book know what 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.610
 Olya Monday read it kind of like 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.100
 liked and does not appear at all as 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.970
 get not get to her this summer 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.709
 but let's see how things go because 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.390
 because I don't know to replace it 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.549
 can i read nothing at all 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.019
 then comes the books that I really want 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.299
 read them in the summer is quite possible 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.350
 I'll do it in July as soon as I return and 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.320
 your trip and this is lnr and part primal 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.769
 failure the first item on my list is that 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.049
 make yourself states worth buying online 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.239
 and buy for the strength of the forms of Robert Galbraith 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.590
 which is also 3 rouling well a 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.790
 to come tours online 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.130
 I'd like to have everything before 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.350
 has withdrawn from the rest of the rainbow roll and 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.500
 so he asks for Eleanor in park and 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.140
 fangirl angel i was already starting to read but 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.880
 not really read it if you can say so 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.640
 because something like that so I have it 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.780
 deposited and remained lying that place 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.239
 where did she put it 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.450
 Eleanor the breed promises sad 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.340
 some not all rejoice 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.170
 this summer, yes, and the last two books 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.700
 which I would like to come this summer not 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.860
 It seems very similar in subject to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.850
 their edges are similar to the cover 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.609
 This is Alison Hoover Bartlett's first book . 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.709
 hitch last books that match and of course 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.450
 ghost authors where john hart where 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.280
 many of you love for sure times 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.700
 heard from all possible Russian speakers 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.050
 Tigers have this book. I want to come. 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.030
 because I don't know what the book is 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.190
 absolutely no kid understand no less 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.680
 bought it on type 2 and then in the past 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.950
 year when they had wild sales and 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.610
 this book was originally worth 32 dollars 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.280
 I bought it for my 9 or 8 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.940
 dollars something in general it was 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.830
 good suggestion and i book me 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.720
 like the cover is written what is it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.180
 true story of the city so body and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.410
 man turned on the books so 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.720
 it must be something very interesting 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.520
 About this book, I think it costs nothing 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.860
 talk and add because all that 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.290
 You can choose not already heard 1 I'm on you 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.740
 I haven't read it yet, but I plan it. 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.320
 to make 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.270
 this summer as we might have guessed 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.010
 I would like to read these books 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.900
 in the summer I will tell you little about the storms 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.940
 plot because as you know i 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.979
 quite often the book is nothing about them 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.840
 know because i'm afraid that the slightest 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.630
 plot data is not used 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.760
 impressions of the book so i cant 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.220
 talk about the book that show 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.200
 before oh you serve tell me what you 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.700
 are going to read this summer quite 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.530
 maybe something on our list 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.210
 intersects its collector become
