00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.010 

like<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> next<00:00:42.120> thing<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.780> is

like so the next thing you need to do is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
like so the next thing you need to do is
prepare<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.559> object<00:00:43.920> movement<00:00:44.309> unless<00:00:45.120> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
prepare the object movement unless it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
prepare the object movement unless it's
done<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.660> moving<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> rotation<00:00:46.559> points<00:00:46.890> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
done by moving the rotation points in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
done by moving the rotation points in
the<00:00:47.039> bottom<00:00:47.340> corner<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> door<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.989> if

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the bottom corner of the door now if

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.510 
the bottom corner of the door now if
you're<00:00:49.200> using<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.620> door<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> came<00:00:50.280> with

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you're using a door that came with

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
you're using a door that came with
movies<00:00:51.210> ooh<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> don't<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.320> but

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
movies ooh you don't have to do this but

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.020 
movies ooh you don't have to do this but
if<00:00:52.680> you've<00:00:52.770> imported<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.460> wonder<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
if you've imported you wonder what you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.760 
if you've imported you wonder what you
are

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
are

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.849 
are
okay<00:00:56.149> able<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> prepare<00:00:59.420> object<00:01:00.420> movement<00:01:00.859> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
okay able to prepare object movement and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.680 
okay able to prepare object movement and
as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.879> rotation<00:01:03.120> points

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
as you can see the rotation points

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.520 
as you can see the rotation points
already<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.320> place<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:07.170> need<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
already in the right place we need to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
already in the right place we need to
know<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.799> direct<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.610> door<00:01:08.880> movement<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
know it's direct the door movement so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
know it's direct the door movement so
able<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> direct<00:01:10.290> object<00:01:10.710> movement<00:01:11.130> set<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
able to direct object movement set the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
able to direct object movement set the
object<00:01:12.270> rotation<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.740> direct

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
object rotation to does not take direct

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
object rotation to does not take direct
possession<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.509> start<00:01:15.810> recording

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
possession and then you start recording

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.289 
possession and then you start recording
and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.920> rotate<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> door<00:01:17.490> using<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> left

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and you rotate the door using the left

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.070 
and you rotate the door using the left
and<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.600> arrow<00:01:18.960> keys<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> direct<00:01:21.330> object

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and right arrow keys so direct object

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.310 
and right arrow keys so direct object
movement<00:01:22.850> see<00:01:23.850> object<00:01:24.240> rotation<00:01:24.540> does<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
movement see object rotation does not a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.179 
movement see object rotation does not a
big<00:01:25.560> director<00:01:25.799> possession<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.799> record

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
big director possession and you record

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
big director possession and you record
and<00:01:31.970> open<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> cause<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> door<00:01:33.720> using<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and open and cause the door using the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
and open and cause the door using the
left<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.650> arrow<00:01:34.920> keys<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
left and right arrow keys that's the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.270 
left and right arrow keys that's the
door<00:01:35.939> opening<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.540> once<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.680> closing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
door opening out once and then closing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.690 
door opening out once and then closing
and<00:01:38.460> opening<00:01:39.329> N<00:01:39.780> works<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and opening N works so just go to the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.920 
and opening N works so just go to the
timeline<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> works

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.179 

okay<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:53.990> opening<00:01:54.680> outwards<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:57.409> closing<00:01:57.979> and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.520 

here's<00:02:10.060> an<00:02:10.179> example<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:10.659> our<00:02:10.840> animation<00:02:11.349> being

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
here's an example of our animation being

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.259 
here's an example of our animation being
used<00:02:11.799> in<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.010> video<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.879> can<00:02:12.999> see<00:02:13.150> as<00:02:13.239> a

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
used in a video as you can see as a

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.089 
used in a video as you can see as a
priest<00:02:13.599> coming<00:02:13.989> up<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> door<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.859> knocking

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
priest coming up to a door and knocking

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:27.539 
priest coming up to a door and knocking
on<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.790> getting<00:02:15.969> a<00:02:16.180> better<00:02:16.329> surprise<00:02:26.549> okay

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
on it and getting a better surprise okay

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.619 
on it and getting a better surprise okay
the<00:02:27.639> next<00:02:27.819> thing<00:02:27.939> we're<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.329> look<00:02:28.480> at

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
the next thing we're going to look at

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.959 
the next thing we're going to look at
changing<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.170> doors<00:02:29.439> opening<00:02:29.889> speeds<00:02:30.189> so<00:02:30.939> you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
changing the doors opening speeds so you

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.520 
changing the doors opening speeds so you
repeat<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:31.450> previous<00:02:31.959> steps<00:02:32.230> up<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.379> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
repeat this previous steps up to the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.709 
repeat this previous steps up to the
record<00:02:32.829> stage<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:33.819> change<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
record stage and then change the

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.629 
record stage and then change the
rotation<00:02:34.840> speed<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.560> smoothness<00:02:36.010> high<00:02:36.280> speed

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
rotation speed and smoothness high speed

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.580

I've got a custom guided tour listing
and<00:03:37.069> I<00:03:38.069> go<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> prepare<00:03:38.879> object<00:03:39.840> movement<00:03:40.260> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
and I go to prepare object movement and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.890 
and I go to prepare object movement and
then<00:03:41.280> move<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> rotation<00:03:42.090> point<00:03:42.299> opposite

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
then move the rotation point opposite

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:52.309 
then move the rotation point opposite

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
a daughter mess situation and what you

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.539 
a daughter mess situation and what you
need<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.319> do<00:03:55.409> now<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.650> direct<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.190> object

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
need to do now is direct the object

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.430 
need to do now is direct the object
movement<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.599> again<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.989> set<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.349> object

the door at this point it would actually

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.939 
the door at this point it would actually
rotate<00:04:27.090> left<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.840> right<00:04:28.020> rather<00:04:28.410> than<00:04:28.590> up<00:04:28.800> and

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
rotate left to right rather than up and

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.700 
rotate left to right rather than up and
down<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.750> be<00:04:30.900> rotating<00:04:31.410> in<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.590> wrong

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
down so it be rotating in the wrong

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.800 
down so it be rotating in the wrong
direction<00:04:31.919> so<00:04:32.490> facing<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.510> daughter<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.780> very

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
direction so facing the daughter is very

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.980 
direction so facing the daughter is very
