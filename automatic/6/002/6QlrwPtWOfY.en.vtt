00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
stuck on a bit of a napkin sketch idea

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.910 
stuck on a bit of a napkin sketch idea
for<00:00:18.779> almost<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> other<00:00:19.410> better<00:00:19.590> part<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
for almost the other better part of a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519 
for almost the other better part of a
decade<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.699> then<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> went<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> Nider<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
decade and then when I went to Nider in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
decade and then when I went to Nider in
2008<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.510> said<00:00:24.660> why<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:24.990> write<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
2008 I just said why don't we write that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.380 
2008 I just said why don't we write that
screenplay<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> general<00:00:26.760> idea<00:00:26.789> started

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
screenplay but the general idea started

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
screenplay but the general idea started
over<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> better<00:00:28.050> part<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> decade<00:00:28.560> ago<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
over the better part of a decade ago I

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.980 
over the better part of a decade ago I
think<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> most<00:00:30.240> important<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
think that's the most important and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.610 
think that's the most important and
decision<00:00:31.650> mark<00:00:32.040> himself<00:00:32.309> made<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.620> doing

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
decision mark himself made when doing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
decision mark himself made when doing
the<00:00:34.710> film<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.570> Wagga<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.050> don't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the film was was doing in Wagga I don't

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.510 
the film was was doing in Wagga I don't
think<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.680> could<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.920> made<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> anywhere

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
think we could have made it anywhere

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
think we could have made it anywhere
else<00:00:39.079> we<00:00:40.079> wouldn't<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.379> got<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> support<00:00:40.950> in

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
else we wouldn't have got the support in

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.330 
else we wouldn't have got the support in
anywhere<00:00:41.610> else<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:42.030> sure<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:44.160> where

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
anywhere else I'm sure and that's where

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.930 
anywhere else I'm sure and that's where
I<00:00:44.370> belong

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I belong

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
I belong
once<00:00:45.660> we'd<00:00:45.809> written<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> script<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:47.370> spent
