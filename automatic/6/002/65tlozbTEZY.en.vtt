00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello my name is makar light i am 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.980
 often faced with such a problem that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 people who are interested in science 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 in-depth and not study and all this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 due to the fact that for in-depth 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.859
 studying need to read a lot of books 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.680
 understand and learn the law and in doing so 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 fix them solving all this tasks 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 a bit scaring people but i can you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 advise a way how fascinating 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 start deepened study physics not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 away from the computer I want 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.559
 recommend you the game operation genius 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.559
 sleeping squad physics 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.900
 what is the plot of the game the hero for which you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 play a job at a firm by 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.420
 bicycle production and beyond 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.600
 pours it at the very beginning asks you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.470
 call this company and select a location from 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.180
 plain 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.180
 yes not really difficult 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.920
 after that you proceed to the game and her 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.120
 at first glance it is no different 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.400
 from any other 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.220
 economic strategy has nothing to do with it 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.310
 the graphics are pretty low but 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.710
 there is something that distinguishes this game from all 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.380
 other games for normal and 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.229
 progressive development of the company as you 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 the engineer is handed over to do the calculations in that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 or another situation 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 you already know two americans managed 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 make the first manned flight if 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880
 we will be able to design suitable for 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 flight wing then we can attract 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.450
 banking capital investments and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 create fascinating devices like you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.119
 understand the calculation is to solve 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.609
 tasks in all areas of physics or 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.789
 finding answers to questions on physics 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.990
 all this is built into the plot of the game as far as 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.079
 company development 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.259
 and at first the tasks are very easy 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.349
 and gradually complicate the correct 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.899
 they give you a solution but for their mistakes 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.780
 take off while there is an opportunity when 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 error answer again and even sometimes 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.709
 use the hint 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.520
 but still found an investor ready 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.780
 invest money issue capacitors 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.540
 some physics experiments 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.840
 also nicely animated what else 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.819
 adds interest besides in the game you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.480
 you can write a scientific journal 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.640
 nineteenth century and my favorite 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 correspond with famous scientists for 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 travel time you will produce 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.600
 and locomotives and balloons and cars and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.190
 airplanes you will also receive 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.160
 patents for inventions 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.250
 the game has two minuses 1 of course 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.340
 graphics but he's great absolutely no 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.470
 interesting for driving and 2 some 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.819
 tasks can after the correct answer 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.640
 repeat again 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.239
 but if you answer correctly again 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.910
 you will be given a reward again so 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.090
 I do not know whether it is minus in the description 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.790
 link where you can download this game in this 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.260
 series there is still a game operation genius 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.260
 special squad biologists 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.820
 if you like the review i will review 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.549
 on this game 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.680
 I hope you enjoy the game 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.530
 and be happy like me 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.530
 playing physics all see you soon
