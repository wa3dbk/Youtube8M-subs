our hopes is that we will create a

our hopes is that we will create a

this country as a model and as the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.899 
this country as a model and as the

think<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.750> future<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:38.070> there<00:01:38.250> are

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
ensure the grass is growing year round

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
ensure the grass is growing year round
this<00:01:45.509> requires<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.350> irrigation<00:01:46.920> system<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.490> a
