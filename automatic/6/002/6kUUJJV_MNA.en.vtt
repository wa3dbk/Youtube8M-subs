00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:06.173
 [music] 

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.922
 We are located in the vast, arched hall of the Bargello Museum in Florence. 

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:12.691
 It was originally a judicial building. 

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.041
 Today it houses a museum. 

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:18.825
 There is Donatella's "David", which is one of the most important sculptures of the early Renaissance. 

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:26.924
 This statue is important because it was the first free-standing naked sculpture since classical antiquity, which was quite a success. 

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:32.418
 For thousands of years, the West influenced by Christianity has focused primarily on the soul. 

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:35.251
 The body was viewed as a path to corruption. 

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.951
 Therefore, it was not celebrated. 

00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.918
 What we see here is a return to admiration and respect for the body, 

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:45.097
 which are absolutely evident and typical of ancient Greece and Rome. 

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:49.326
 Donatello formed David according to the statues of ancient Greece and Rome, from which he took for example 

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:54.592
 a typical attitude called "counterpoint", a relaxed pose 

00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:58.332
 when the weight of the body rests on one leg while the other leg is bent. 

00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:03.204
 Contrast gives the figure a sense of movement. 

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:09.704
 In Renaissance, this statue was extremely vivid, compared to medieval sculptures. 

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:12.853
 The statue is not part of any sculpture or architecture. 

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:17.887
 So it really induces a sense of autonomy, as if the statue itself could suddenly step forward. 

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:21.720
 This statue points to its classicity also by the structure of the material from which it is made. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.787
 It is a bronze with the bulk of copper, in which we find a little tin to reinforce the material and the whole statue is hollow. 

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:32.237
 It was created by a technique called Lost Wax Casting 

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:35.788
 ancient Romans and Greeks, 

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:39.421
 and which has also been used throughout the Middle Ages, but not on such a large scale. 

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.253
 Already in the early Renaissance, artists are beginning to explore the way 

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:47.038
 how to create bronze statues of this size. 

00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:55.495
 David is very young, and it is hard to miss the sensuality with which he puts his hand on his hip 

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:57.412
 and he looks down at the ground. 

00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:02.729
 Furthermore, the fact that he only wears shoes and a hat while the rest of his body is completely naked, 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.445
 it creates a sense of eroticism. 

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:12.378
 You will fully realize this if you find out that David is standing on the head of Goliath, now severely cut off. 

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:17.329
 And David holds the sword of Goliath in his right hand; 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.290
 and just the head beneath his foot makes the leg bent. 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.623
 One of the wings on Goliath's helm makes its way up the inner thigh of David, which may be too high. 

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:30.440
 Thus, we can observe the obvious sign of sexuality. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 It is very interesting because this is contrary to the civil symbolism of this statue. 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.906
 It was a statue that was truly significant to Florence and was now "tainted" by this apparent intimacy. 

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:46.939
 The statue was seen in the garden of Medice in the 1560s. 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.256
 Although it is not entirely clear who took the statues, it is likely that it was Medice. 

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:55.423
 The Medici Palace had a wide entrance hall that was built so 

00:02:55.423 --> 00:02:59.423
 to be seen directly into the garden, in whose center the statue would be visible. 

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:00.206
 And that is true. 

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:03.623
 However, remember that she did not imagine it for the Florentines 

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:06.106
 this statue only of the biblical king david. 

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:08.506
 There were many other associations. 

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:13.924
 First. In the Bible story, David defeats his enemy even though he doesn't seem to have a chance to win. 

00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:16.323
 He defeats his opponent with the help of God. 

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:20.974
 The Florentines identified themselves with David in some way, 

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:23.523
 for, like him, they have defeated their enemies. 

00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:29.891
 Specifically, they defeated the Duke of Milan in the early 15th century. 

00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.256
 According to them, with the help of God. 

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:36.553
 They even felt blessed and chosen by God and considered themselves followers of the ancient Roman Republic. 

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:42.386
 And so the theme of David was portrayed by Florence itself, the Florentine Republic. 

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:45.453
 Thus Goliath, in a sense, represents the Duke of Milan. 

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:52.070
 Milan was much stronger than Florence, which, unlike Milan, was only a trading center. 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.874
 And while Florence was a republic, there was sovereignty in Milan. 

00:03:56.874 --> 00:03:58.574
 Which means she had a single ruler. 

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:02.158
 So David became a symbol of Florence. 

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.891
 Anyone looking at this statue in the Medice's garden in the 15th century 

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:13.073
 would understand the connection between David and freedom that was so 

00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:17.540
 worshiped by the Florentines and threatened by the Duke of Milan. 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.650
 On the other hand, it could be said that in some sense the Medics broke this symbol for themselves. 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.701
 When the Medice were driven out of town, the statue was placed 

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:31.018
 at City Hall, making it a public statue. 

00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:36.061
 There is a real company contribution to this story. 

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:42.978
 By placing this city symbol and the most precious thing the city had in the garden, the Medics 

00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:47.704
 they had actually adopted it without permission, and had it only for themselves. 

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:52.444
 Then in the statue of David we see the embodiment of the promise of his long reign. 

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:58.812
 David will grow up in a king who will be incredibly wise, which is good 

00:04:58.812 --> 00:05:05.146
 it was the Medics who passed on this story as a representation, not so much of the city itself as their own power over this city. 

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:10.913
 So they identify with the city of Florence, the youth, 

00:05:10.913 --> 00:05:15.130
 King David and all the great concerning the Republic of Florence. 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.012
 And although this statue is a representation of war, 

00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:22.080
 The symbols are clearly about David and Peace and Medice and Peace. 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.046
 David has a light hat on his head in contrast to the helmet, the sign of war, 

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:26.980
 that Goliath wears. 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.596
 David cut off Goliath's head with his own sword-hardened battle. 

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:35.747
 If you look at the sword close up, you will see notches on it. 

00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:37.746
 It means many, many battles. 

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:41.129
 David needed to obtain it so that he could wipe Goliath's head. 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.613
 In his left hand, he holds a stone, 

00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:47.689
 probably the stone he wanted 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.472
 originally to collapse Goliath. 

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:54.405
 But I think it's interesting how Donatello, the creator of David, 

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:59.838
 it depicts this stone as opposed to the sword. 

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:03.364
 This is the material Donatello has often worked with as a sculptor 

00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:06.948
 He worked with marble as often as bronze and perhaps even more often. 

00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:10.980
 Are these weapons depicting two opposing cities? 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.897
 In other words, a representation of Milan's violence against the culture of Florence? 

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:20.130
 Iconography of David, in various meanings and its significance for Florence, 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.198
 eroticism, even homo erotica. 

00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:28.330
 Art historians are still not quite sure how these characters and meanings are 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.830
 Florentines perceived in the 15th century. 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.463
 Some art historians have even said that 

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:38.429
 this statue doesn't even have to be David 

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.677
 but it could be a statue of Mercury. 

00:06:40.677 --> 00:06:44.878
 The way of interpreting this work is therefore very complicated and equally complicated 

00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:48.543
 it could be seen by the Florentines of the 15th century and they could still have it 

00:06:48.543 --> 00:06:51.043
 there are several explanations for this statue. 

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:54.244
 This is an important reminder that art history is a process 

00:06:54.244 --> 00:07:00.229
 who seeks to restore and understand the meaning of works through the eye of time. 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:01.793
 Now it's about 600 years old. 

00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:02.660
 It is true. 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.028
 However, we stand before one of the amazing statues, 

00:07:06.028 --> 00:07:10.028
 which embody many and many 15th century ideas and interests.
