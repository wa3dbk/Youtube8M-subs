contortion 3-wood this whisky came about

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.660 
contortion 3-wood this whisky came about
by<00:00:14.650> mistake<00:00:16.199> many<00:00:17.199> years<00:00:17.439> ago<00:00:17.619> we<00:00:18.550> were

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
by mistake many years ago we were

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.519 
by mistake many years ago we were
experimenting<00:00:19.449> with<00:00:19.659> different<00:00:19.869> wood<00:00:20.230> types

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
experimenting with different wood types

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.279 
experimenting with different wood types
and<00:00:20.949> just<00:00:21.519> how<00:00:22.179> different<00:00:22.689> would<00:00:22.810> flavors

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
and just how different would flavors

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.809 
and just how different would flavors
would<00:00:23.439> work<00:00:23.650> together<00:00:23.859> with<00:00:24.220> her<00:00:24.369> whiskies

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:24.819 
would work together with her whiskies

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.329 
would work together with her whiskies
and<00:00:25.630> we<00:00:25.779> took<00:00:25.929> whisky<00:00:26.529> that<00:00:26.679> had<00:00:26.800> spent<00:00:27.039> 10

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
and we took whisky that had spent 10

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.939 
and we took whisky that had spent 10
years<00:00:27.369> in<00:00:27.909> American<00:00:28.419> bourbon<00:00:28.599> barrels<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.409> we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
years in American bourbon barrels and we

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.810 
years in American bourbon barrels and we
transferred<00:00:30.489> it<00:00:30.609> into<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.929> finest<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:33.520> our

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
transferred it into the finest all our

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.780 
transferred it into the finest all our
dorsal<00:00:34.120> casks<00:00:34.690> we<00:00:35.620> continue<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.190> monitor<00:00:36.400> it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
dorsal casks we continue to monitor it

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.270 
dorsal casks we continue to monitor it
through<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.210> 11th<00:00:38.080> year<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.410> looking<00:00:38.950> at<00:00:39.100> it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
through that 11th year of looking at it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.910 
through that 11th year of looking at it
periodically<00:00:40.030> just<00:00:40.060> to<00:00:40.510> decide<00:00:41.470> when<00:00:41.770> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
periodically just to decide when the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.340 
periodically just to decide when the
whisky<00:00:42.280> was<00:00:43.180> going<00:00:43.450> to<00:00:43.510> come<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.780> its<00:00:44.050> plane

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
whisky was going to come to its plane

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.890 
whisky was going to come to its plane
and<00:00:46.380> it<00:00:47.380> was<00:00:47.560> Andrew<00:00:47.890> Rankin<00:00:48.370> who<00:00:48.700> too<00:00:49.510> pointed

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
and it was Andrew Rankin who too pointed

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.080 
and it was Andrew Rankin who too pointed
out<00:00:50.050> that<00:00:50.380> you<00:00:50.800> know<00:00:50.890> perhaps<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.670> could<00:00:51.910> do

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
out that you know perhaps this could do

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.650 
out that you know perhaps this could do
with<00:00:52.270> an<00:00:52.570> extra<00:00:52.720> little<00:00:53.110> jag<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:54.660> suggested

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
with an extra little jag and suggested

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.110 
with an extra little jag and suggested
that<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:57.130> thought<00:00:57.400> would<00:00:57.640> take<00:00:57.670> was

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
that it the thought would take was

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.330 
that it the thought would take was
introduced<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:58.930> we<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.530> know<00:00:59.560> we<00:00:59.680> would<00:01:00.010> look

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
introduced and we you know we would look

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.049 
introduced and we you know we would look
at<00:01:00.460> an<00:01:00.850> extra<00:01:01.660> year<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.410> sherry<00:01:02.650> cask<00:01:03.010> just<00:01:03.970> a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
at an extra year and sherry cask just a

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.020 
at an extra year and sherry cask just a
bowl<00:01:04.239> full<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.540> whiskey<00:01:05.130> so<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.159> lot<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.579> casks

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
bowl full of whiskey so a lot of casks

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.459 
bowl full of whiskey so a lot of casks
were<00:01:07.149> ordered<00:01:07.689> in<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.109> whiskey<00:01:08.439> was

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
were ordered in and the whiskey was

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.800 
were ordered in and the whiskey was
promptly<00:01:08.950> filled<00:01:09.249> into<00:01:09.609> them<00:01:09.780> unbeknown<00:01:10.780> to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
promptly filled into them unbeknown to

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.859 
promptly filled into them unbeknown to
us<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:12.399> casks<00:01:12.819> had<00:01:12.939> actually<00:01:13.270> previously

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
us the casks had actually previously

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.760 
us the casks had actually previously
held<00:01:14.049> Pedro<00:01:14.499> Jimenez<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.189> no<00:01:15.490> Oloroso<00:01:16.149> sherry

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
held Pedro Jimenez and no Oloroso sherry

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.849 
held Pedro Jimenez and no Oloroso sherry
so<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:17.890> became<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.369> birth<00:01:18.579> of<00:01:19.079> 3-wood<00:01:20.079> it

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
so they became the birth of 3-wood it

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.739 
so they became the birth of 3-wood it
was<00:01:21.009> monitored<00:01:21.249> throughout<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:22.090> next<00:01:22.450> year

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
was monitored throughout that next year

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.950 
was monitored throughout that next year
and<00:01:23.819> just<00:01:24.819> they<00:01:24.939> really<00:01:25.210> see<00:01:25.389> how<00:01:25.539> it<00:01:25.569> would

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
and just they really see how it would

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.620 
and just they really see how it would
prove<00:01:26.200> des<00:01:26.469> and<00:01:26.859> what<00:01:27.700> came<00:01:27.909> about<00:01:28.030> was<00:01:28.479> this

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
prove des and what came about was this

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.419 
prove des and what came about was this
product<00:01:29.170> which<00:01:29.409> I<00:01:29.560> think<00:01:29.829> has<00:01:30.039> become

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
product which I think has become

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.149 
product which I think has become
synonymous<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.569> the<00:01:31.959> quality<00:01:32.439> of<00:01:32.679> or
