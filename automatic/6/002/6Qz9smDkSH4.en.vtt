00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
wintry conditions this helps pull the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.690 
wintry conditions this helps pull the
air<00:03:51.170> from<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.500> chin<00:03:51.710> vent<00:03:51.860> at<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.070> front<00:03:52.340> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
air from the chin vent at the front and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.190 
air from the chin vent at the front and
creates<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.120> curtain<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.540> air<00:03:53.660> which<00:03:53.810> goes<00:03:54.020> up

inside<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.740> visor<00:03:54.950> which<00:03:55.160> aids<00:03:55.430> demister<00:03:56.060> so

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
inside the visor which aids demister so

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.850 
inside the visor which aids demister so
you've<00:03:56.630> got<00:03:56.720> those<00:03:56.810> two<00:03:57.050> extra<00:03:57.350> extract
