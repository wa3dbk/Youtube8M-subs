it also matches in terms of screen size
in<00:00:19.109> general<00:00:19.439> dimensions<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.640> you're<00:00:20.789> just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in general dimensions so you're just

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.130 
in general dimensions so you're just
going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> try<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.600> look<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:21.960> them

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
going to try and take a look at them

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.109 
going to try and take a look at them
here's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> size<00:00:23.369> comparison<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.970> now

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
here's a size comparison right now

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.890 
here's a size comparison right now
actually<00:00:24.920> both<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.070> these<00:00:26.160> phones<00:00:26.539> run<00:00:27.539> ice

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
them have skins on top so there's sense

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
them have skins on top so there's sense
full<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.710> 1x<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.320> as<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.380> believe<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> so

that part of the unlocking process with
the<00:00:56.250> Samsung<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.379> this<00:00:58.379> whole<00:00:58.530> idea

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the Samsung is actually this whole idea

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.209 
the Samsung is actually this whole idea
of<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.230> essentially<00:01:01.230> dabbing<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.890> finger

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of you essentially dabbing your finger

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.090 
of you essentially dabbing your finger
into<00:01:02.430> water<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.470> take<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> look<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.920> now

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
into water you can take a look at now

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
into water you can take a look at now
it's<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.420> particularly<00:01:07.020> intuitive<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's not particularly intuitive you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's not particularly intuitive you
don't<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.250> know<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.670> you've<00:01:08.820> done

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
don't really know when you've done

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.179 
don't really know when you've done
enough<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.330> unlock<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
enough to unlock it but it's there if we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.219 
enough to unlock it but it's there if we
take<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> look<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> window<00:01:12.479> shade<00:01:12.720> menu<00:01:13.080> up

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
take a look at the window shade menu up

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
take a look at the window shade menu up
to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> top<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:14.369> still<00:01:14.580> quite<00:01:14.850> familiar<00:01:15.030> for

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to the top it's still quite familiar for

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
to the top it's still quite familiar for
samsung<00:01:16.439> touch<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.799> users<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
samsung touch with users you have a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
samsung touch with users you have a
bunch<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.509> Launcher<00:01:19.320> icons<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.460> top

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bunch of Launcher icons at the very top

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
bunch of Launcher icons at the very top
then<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.409> notifications

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
then you have your notifications

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.999 
then you have your notifications
underneath<00:01:23.570> ongoing<00:01:24.570> items<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> can

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
underneath ongoing items which you can

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
underneath ongoing items which you can
swipe<00:01:26.460> away<00:01:26.640> presumably<00:01:27.360> yeah<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.200> very

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
swipe away presumably yeah that's very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.490 
swipe away presumably yeah that's very
much<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.220> standard<00:01:30.180> Android<00:01:30.450> 4.0<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
much like standard Android 4.0 so you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.450 
much like standard Android 4.0 so you
going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> standard

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
going to see a lot of the standard

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
going to see a lot of the standard
Android<00:01:32.759> 4.2<00:01:33.180> features<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.229> you're

depth<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> good<00:01:45.420> idea<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:46.140> are<00:01:46.290> they

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
depth to get a good idea of how are they

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
depth to get a good idea of how are they
going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> work<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.210> down<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.509> the
