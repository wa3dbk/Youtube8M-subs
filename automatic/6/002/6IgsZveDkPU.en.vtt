there<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:28.370> it's<00:04:28.610> an<00:04:28.700> easier<00:04:29.060> way<00:04:29.180> for<00:04:29.210> me

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
there I think it's an easier way for me

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.360 
there I think it's an easier way for me
to<00:04:29.630> interact<00:04:29.840> with<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.200> guys<00:04:30.260> about<00:04:30.560> Pokemon

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
to interact with you guys about Pokemon

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.100 
to interact with you guys about Pokemon

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's not always easy for me to respond

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.680 
it's not always easy for me to respond
to<00:04:33.200> YouTube<00:04:33.590> comments<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.130> things<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
to YouTube comments and things like that

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.410

but<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.720> think<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.140> cool<00:04:36.380> way<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:37.420> keep

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
but I think this is a cool way to keep

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.870 
but I think this is a cool way to keep
the<00:04:38.660> Pokemon<00:04:39.320> community<00:04:39.770> together<00:04:40.490> and
