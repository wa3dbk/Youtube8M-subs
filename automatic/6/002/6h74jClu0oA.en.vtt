never ride switch I have no idea how to
do<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.809> even<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> good<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.649> doing

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
do it I'm not even that good at doing

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
do it I'm not even that good at doing
goofy<00:00:47.660> but<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.960> they're<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.980> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
goofy but if they're in like this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420 
goofy but if they're in like this
condition<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:51.000> condition<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.430> don't

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
condition good condition then I don't

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100

think<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> should<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> review<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.930> don't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
think you should do a review you don't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.209 
think you should do a review you don't
really<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> durability<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.219> like

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
really know to durability of it but like

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
really know to durability of it but like
I've<00:00:59.460> skated<00:00:59.789> these<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.750> already<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
I've skated these a lot already if I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
I've skated these a lot already if I
didn't<00:01:01.770> look<00:01:01.859> shoo<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:03.180> they'd<00:01:03.809> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
didn't look shoo go on then they'd have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
didn't look shoo go on then they'd have
to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.199> thrown<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> i<00:01:07.799> bought<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.280> for

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to be thrown out so i bought these for

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.230 
to be thrown out so i bought these for
fifteen<00:01:09.360> dollars<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.890> cheap<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
fifteen dollars it's really cheap it's a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.070 
fifteen dollars it's really cheap it's a
standard<00:01:12.720> vulcanized<00:01:13.260> shoe<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.869> one

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
standard vulcanized shoe but i think one

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
standard vulcanized shoe but i think one
thing<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.350> makes<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.520> durable<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
thing that makes it not as durable is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.210 
thing that makes it not as durable is
this<00:01:19.049> part<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.280> toe<00:01:20.460> box<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.909> suede<00:01:21.439> but<00:01:24.170> like

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
this part the toe box is suede but like

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.070 
this part the toe box is suede but like
here<00:01:26.220> where<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.580> pointing<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.689> their<00:01:27.840> shoe

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
here where I'm pointing or their shoe

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.810 
here where I'm pointing or their shoe
goo<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> canvas<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.090> since<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.810> canvas

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
goo this is canvas so since it's canvas

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
goo this is canvas so since it's canvas
it's<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.810> heavy<00:01:34.079> duty<00:01:34.470> canvas<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.189> still

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it's like heavy duty canvas but still

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.999 
it's like heavy duty canvas but still
soon<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.900> visit<00:01:37.320> rips<00:01:37.530> easier<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
soon as can visit rips easier and

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.679 
soon as can visit rips easier and
otherwise<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.610> normal<00:01:41.820> vulcanized

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
otherwise it's just a normal vulcanized

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
otherwise it's just a normal vulcanized
skateboarding<00:01:43.290> shoe<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.670> to

skateboarding shoe I don't know what to
say<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.299> cheap<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.649> deal<00:01:46.860> if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
say it's cheap so it's a good deal if

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
much less protection after some kick

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
much less protection after some kick
