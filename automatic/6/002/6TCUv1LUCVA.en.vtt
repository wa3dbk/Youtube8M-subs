00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello girls in this video I will make you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 see how to make a key 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 personalized 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.480
 first we will go to take the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.680
 mastra Key is a chosen color 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 I preferred the 338 of the kiko lovato 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.199
 then extend lightly and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 covering in all the looking key 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.189
 so to perfectly color everyone 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 the corners 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.850
 of course you can choose the colors 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.260
 which you like the most 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.270
 once dry we go to get it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 again the enamel and we do one 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 second pass we do this second 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 passed both to make the color 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 homogeneous for both to guarantee a long 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 estate 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 of course if you fail to keep o 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 however it is inconvenient to hold the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 key in your hands you can take one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.079
 tweezers or the one for the clothes and put on 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
 the key in the tweezers so that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.570
 even when there is time to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.080
 drying 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.450
 you don't have to be with the dark key 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 then we go to take some sequins 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.240
 similar to al to the chosen base color 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.330
 and with the fan brush we go to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.970
 dust on I finally went to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.180
 take a very transparent that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 buys and long ago at the stalls but 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.150
 does not use it in mai because a 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.070
 components that I don't like 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.220
 so I prefer to use it in these 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 cases is a very beautiful color indeed a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.799
 smaller and bigger sequins and lo 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.090
 then we go to spend well in 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.090
 all in all points 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.490
 I hope you like it, we do it well 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.960
 dry and this is the end result 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.119
 so it's just a matter of imagination 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.619
 choose a color and make it 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.619
 your key hello girls
