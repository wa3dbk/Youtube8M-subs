as far as color rendition goes and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.220 
brightness and contrast it all looks
pretty<00:00:23.490> accurate<00:00:24.090> from<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.960> looking

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
pretty accurate from the way I'm looking

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.080 
pretty accurate from the way I'm looking
at<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.590> monitors<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
at my monitors and what you do need to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
at my monitors and what you do need to
do<00:00:27.240> sometimes<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.930> adjust<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
do sometimes is adjust your a way that

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
do sometimes is adjust your a way that
you<00:00:29.250> preview<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.730> monitors<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.449> general<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you preview your monitors in general so

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.959 
you preview your monitors in general so
a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> times<00:00:31.859> especially<00:00:32.009> Apple<00:00:32.610> displays

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a lot of times especially Apple displays

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.090 
a lot of times especially Apple displays
they're<00:00:33.239> they're<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.719> bright<00:00:34.050> naturally<00:00:34.620> so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
they're they're very bright naturally so

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
they're they're very bright naturally so
you<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> compensate<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you have to compensate for that and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
you have to compensate for that and
understand<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.860> artificially

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
understand that is it's artificially

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
understand that is it's artificially
being<00:00:38.820> brightened<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.570> image<00:00:39.960> itself

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
being brightened in the image itself

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.540 
being brightened in the image itself
it's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.440> bright<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.860> let<00:00:40.980> me<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.219> open<00:00:41.370> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it's not bright so let me just open this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's not bright so let me just open this
package<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.930> say<00:00:43.110> this

package up for you now I will say this
the<00:00:43.500> calibration<00:00:44.129> itself<00:00:44.430> wasn't<00:00:44.760> hard<00:00:44.969> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the calibration itself wasn't hard this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.910 
the calibration itself wasn't hard this
actual<00:00:45.960> device<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> looked<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
actual device here I looked at the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.560 
actual device here I looked at the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
checker version of the checker passport

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
checker version of the checker passport
was<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.090> robust<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:51.750> an

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
was a little more robust that has an

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
was a little more robust that has an
actual<00:00:52.140> cord<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> 20<00:00:52.890> mount<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> bottom

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
actual cord a 20 mount on the bottom

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
actual cord a 20 mount on the bottom
that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.360> mount<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that you can actually mount it if you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
that you can actually mount it if you
needed<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.550> looked<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> little

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
needed to and it just looked a little

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
needed to and it just looked a little
easier<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> hold<00:00:57.539> versus<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.410> wish<00:00:58.559> they

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
easier to hold versus this I wish they

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
easier to hold versus this I wish they
would<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.920> had<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.309> extra<00:00:59.520> tabs<00:00:59.969> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
would have had a little extra tabs on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
would have had a little extra tabs on
the<00:01:00.300> side<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.230> hold<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> you're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the side so when you do hold it you're

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 
the side so when you do hold it you're
not<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.070> touching<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> collar<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
not actually touching the collar the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
not actually touching the collar the
color<00:01:03.449> swatches<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> white<00:01:04.500> balance<00:01:04.710> part

adjustments<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
adjustments and that's it because I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
adjustments and that's it because I
pretty<00:02:07.890> much<00:02:08.069> shoot<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.640> camera<00:02:09.270> how<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> wanted

contrast<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.370> from<00:02:47.700> raising<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
contrast and it's not from raising the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.810 
contrast and it's not from raising the
exposure<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> values<00:02:50.640> of

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
exposure it's actually the values of

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.390 
exposure it's actually the values of
color<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.360> dull<00:02:51.630> they're<00:02:51.959> low<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.250> that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
color or dull they're low so but that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.340 
color or dull they're low so but that
being<00:02:53.580> said<00:02:53.850> let<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.600> back<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.990> actual

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
being said let me get back to the actual

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.449 
being said let me get back to the actual
thing<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> sounds<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.340> down

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
thing because it sounds like I'm down

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.430 
thing because it sounds like I'm down
talking<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.690> actual<00:02:58.110> thing<00:02:58.290> right

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
talking it but this actual thing right

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.290 
talking it but this actual thing right
here<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.459> counterweight<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.180> you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
here that's a counterweight that you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.030 
here that's a counterweight that you
just<00:03:00.480> pretty<00:03:00.660> much<00:03:00.870> lay<00:03:01.170> over<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> screen<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
just pretty much lay over the screen and

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.949 
just pretty much lay over the screen and
this<00:03:02.580> actual<00:03:02.940> device<00:03:03.240> when<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> first<00:03:03.780> opened

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this actual device when I first opened

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.480 
this actual device when I first opened
this<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.350> really<00:03:04.590> didn't<00:03:04.830> know<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.040> use<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
this I really didn't know how to use it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.100 
this I really didn't know how to use it
I<00:03:05.670> didn't<00:03:06.120> read<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> manual<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.900> pretty

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
I didn't read the manual just pretty

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
I didn't read the manual just pretty
much<00:03:07.260> open<00:03:07.560> out<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> box<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.400> wanted<00:03:08.700> to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
much open out the box and just wanted to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.580 
much open out the box and just wanted to
look<00:03:08.910> at<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.240> has<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> tripod<00:03:10.110> mount<00:03:10.350> on<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
look at it has a tripod mount on the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.020 
look at it has a tripod mount on the
bottom<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:11.190> really<00:03:11.370> sure<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.820> would<00:03:11.910> ever

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
bottom not really sure if you would ever

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.360 
bottom not really sure if you would ever
need<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.330> or<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.990> don't<00:03:13.140> know<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> don't<00:03:13.620> this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
need that or I don't know I don't this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
need that or I don't know I don't this
piece<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:14.850> here<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.360> pops<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.110> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
piece right here actually pops up and it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.229 
piece right here actually pops up and it
slings<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.830> hangs<00:03:17.190> over<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.640> monitors<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
slings and hangs over the monitors and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.610 
slings and hangs over the monitors and
you<00:03:18.300> calibrate<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.110> want<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:19.470> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you calibrate what you want to do is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.680 
you calibrate what you want to do is
basically<00:03:19.830> make<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:21.000> profile<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
basically make the profile for the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.630 
basically make the profile for the
monitors<00:03:22.110> then<00:03:22.410> go<00:03:22.739> ahead<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.130> put<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> color

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
monitors then go ahead and put the color

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.699 
monitors then go ahead and put the color
monkey<00:03:24.000> displays<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.630> put<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.140> somewhat

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
monkey displays you put that somewhat

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.500 
monkey displays you put that somewhat
near<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.160> monitors<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.820> neutral<00:03:27.239> space

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
near the monitors in the neutral space

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390 
near the monitors in the neutral space
and<00:03:27.900> what<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.200> does<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.709> set<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.190> in

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
and what that does is you can set up in

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.580 
and what that does is you can set up in
the<00:03:29.580> program<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.300> app<00:03:30.450> where<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.200> set<00:03:31.500> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
the program or the app where you set it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.110 
the program or the app where you set it
up<00:03:31.650> where<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:31.950> actually<00:03:32.280> checks<00:03:32.550> for<00:03:32.910> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
up where it actually checks for the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.030 
up where it actually checks for the
actual<00:03:33.510> ambient<00:03:34.019> light<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.739> do<00:03:34.860> it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
actual ambient light and you can do it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.710 
actual ambient light and you can do it
where<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.310> know<00:03:35.640> every<00:03:35.880> five<00:03:36.090> minutes<00:03:36.450> or<00:03:36.570> so

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
where you know every five minutes or so

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990 
where you know every five minutes or so
you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.050> manually<00:03:37.320> recheck<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.489> as<00:03:38.760> you're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you can manually recheck it so as you're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
you can manually recheck it so as you're
turning<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.420> different<00:03:39.810> lights<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> room

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
turning on different lights in the room

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.130 
turning on different lights in the room
you<00:03:40.890> can<00:03:41.070> have<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.340> kind<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.580> adjusted<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
you can have it kind of adjusted to the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.960 
you can have it kind of adjusted to the
light<00:03:43.170> glaring<00:03:43.739> off<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> screen<00:03:44.370> even<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
light glaring off the screen even and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
light glaring off the screen even and
stuff<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.989> will<00:03:46.200> say<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.709> used<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
stuff like that I will say I used to

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.820 
stuff like that I will say I used to
Apple<00:03:47.519> cinema<00:03:48.150> displays<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.989> then<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.140> use<00:03:49.440> a

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
Apple cinema displays and then I use a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.610 
Apple cinema displays and then I use a
different<00:03:50.730> brand<00:03:51.030> third<00:03:51.540> display<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.260> Apple

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
different brand third display the Apple

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.100 
different brand third display the Apple
displays<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.489> know<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.330> shifted<00:03:54.900> one

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
displays I know is a little shifted one

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.630 
displays I know is a little shifted one
looks<00:03:55.440> at<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> little<00:03:56.430> more

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
looks at like it has a little more

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.060 
looks at like it has a little more
saturation<00:03:57.239> slightly<00:03:57.870> because<00:03:58.050> my<00:03:58.380> wallpaper

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
saturation slightly because my wallpaper

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.520 
saturation slightly because my wallpaper
is<00:03:59.340> great<00:03:59.700> it's<00:04:00.209> like<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.330> neutral<00:04:00.750> gray<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
is great it's like a neutral gray and I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.560 
is great it's like a neutral gray and I
can<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.890> slight<00:04:02.280> reddish<00:04:02.700> tint<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.300> left

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
can see a slight reddish tint on my left

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.240 
can see a slight reddish tint on my left
monitor<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.200> even<00:04:04.560> after<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:04.890> did<00:04:05.100> this

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
monitor and even after I did this

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.340 
monitor and even after I did this
calibration<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:06.060> still<00:04:06.600> notice<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.110> same

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
calibration I still notice the same

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.960 
calibration I still notice the same
thing<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:07.920> I'm<00:04:08.070> not<00:04:08.190> really<00:04:08.370> sure<00:04:08.610> how<00:04:08.820> much

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
thing so I'm not really sure how much

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.670 
thing so I'm not really sure how much
this<00:04:09.180> helped<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:09.660> didn't<00:04:09.930> help<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.290> does<00:04:10.500> show

that you can suffer yourself I have my

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.790 
that you can suffer yourself I have my

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
setup for every four weeks to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.560 
setup for every four weeks to
recalibrate<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.580> why<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:47.970> have<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.300> do<00:04:48.390> that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
recalibrate it why you have to do that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.510 
recalibrate it why you have to do that
I'm<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.930> exactly<00:04:49.080> sure<00:04:49.470> do<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.890> recommend<00:04:50.250> this

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
I'm not exactly sure do I recommend this

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.700 
I'm not exactly sure do I recommend this
I<00:04:50.790> think<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.540> good<00:04:51.750> investment<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:52.680> I

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
I think it is a good investment but I

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.140 
I think it is a good investment but I
think<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.070> just<00:04:53.250> need<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.490> understand<00:04:53.970> and

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
think you just need to understand and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.610 
think you just need to understand and
ask<00:04:54.270> yourself<00:04:54.600> if<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.810> need<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.290> then<00:04:55.440> one

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
ask yourself if you need it and then one

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.040 
ask yourself if you need it and then one
side<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.160> actual<00:04:56.550> target<00:04:57.390> is<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> white

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
side of the actual target is a white

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.930 
side of the actual target is a white
balance<00:04:58.290> target<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.220> what<00:04:59.370> that's<00:04:59.550> for<00:04:59.790> as

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
balance target and what that's for as

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.610 
balance target and what that's for as
far<00:05:00.090> as<00:05:00.240> I'm<00:05:00.390> concerned<00:05:00.810> or<00:05:00.990> far<00:05:01.260> as<00:05:01.380> I'm<00:05:01.500> aware

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
far as I'm concerned or far as I'm aware

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.440 
far as I'm concerned or far as I'm aware
is<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.520> before<00:05:02.730> you<00:05:02.940> actually<00:05:03.030> do<00:05:03.300> your

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
is that before you actually do your

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.870 
is that before you actually do your
shoot<00:05:03.630> for<00:05:03.810> video<00:05:04.110> or<00:05:04.470> photography<00:05:05.190> go<00:05:05.700> ahead

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
shoot for video or photography go ahead

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.250 
shoot for video or photography go ahead
and<00:05:06.000> set<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.210> white<00:05:06.390> balance<00:05:06.420> just<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.080> it's

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
and set the white balance just so it's

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.780 
and set the white balance just so it's
somewhat<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.770> right<00:05:07.920> ballpark<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.610> then

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
somewhat in the right ballpark and then

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.280 
somewhat in the right ballpark and then
you<00:05:08.940> still<00:05:09.210> go<00:05:09.390> ahead<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.750> use<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.050> actual

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
you still go ahead and use the actual

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.080 
you still go ahead and use the actual
palette<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.890> there's<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.340> neutral<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.000> then

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
palette and there's a neutral and then

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.430 
palette and there's a neutral and then
if<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.300> look<00:05:12.510> at<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.720> there's<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.020> top<00:05:13.260> row

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
if you look at that there's a top row

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.110 
if you look at that there's a top row
and<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> bottom<00:05:13.950> row<00:05:14.070> for<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.280> landscape<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:14.970> for

portrait<00:05:15.630> there's<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.900> neutral<00:05:16.230> portion<00:05:16.620> but

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
