the range goes from a size 12 40 all on
nylon<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.340> nylon<00:02:28.730> ranges<00:02:29.330> from<00:02:29.420> 20

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
nylon and the nylon ranges from 20

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.740 
nylon and the nylon ranges from 20
pounds<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.140> 40<00:02:30.440> pounds<00:02:31.240> we<00:02:32.240> move<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.600> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
pounds to 40 pounds we move on to the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.740 
pounds to 40 pounds we move on to the
hooks<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.980> very<00:02:34.580> high<00:02:34.790> quality<00:02:35.000> hooks<00:02:35.390> again

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
hooks all very high quality hooks again

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.890 
hooks all very high quality hooks again
compression<00:02:36.410> connected<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> studs<00:02:38.090> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
compression connected to the studs so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.600 
compression connected to the studs so
there's<00:02:39.410> no<00:02:39.620> weakness<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.130> there<00:02:40.340> at<00:02:40.430> all

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
there's no weakness in there at all

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.510 
there's no weakness in there at all
there<00:02:40.910> isn't<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.480> weak<00:02:41.810> part<00:02:42.220> unlike<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> knot

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
there isn't a weak part unlike a knot

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.610 
there isn't a weak part unlike a knot
which<00:02:43.880> would<00:02:44.060> give<00:02:44.270> at<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.510> certain<00:02:44.720> breaking

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
which would give at a certain breaking

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.290 
which would give at a certain breaking
strain<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.220> example<00:02:46.550> got<00:02:46.640> 40<00:02:46.880> pounds<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.180> could

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
strain so example got 40 pounds it could

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.420 
strain so example got 40 pounds it could
give<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.570> little<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:47.930> 20<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:48.950> 40<00:02:49.160> pound

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
give as little as 20 this is 40 pound

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.460 
give as little as 20 this is 40 pound
line<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.120> won't<00:02:50.390> go<00:02:50.540> below<00:02:50.690> 40<00:02:51.140> pounds

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
line and that won't go below 40 pounds

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.200 
line and that won't go below 40 pounds
so<00:02:51.650> wherever<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.310> hooked<00:02:52.490> is<00:02:52.670> staying<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
so wherever you hooked is staying on the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.490 
so wherever you hooked is staying on the
hook<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:53.600> coming<00:02:53.810> in

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.820 

and<00:02:56.740> then<00:02:57.550> we<00:02:57.670> move<00:02:57.820> on<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.150> bad<00:02:58.300> boys

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
and then we move on to the bad boys

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.320 
and then we move on to the bad boys
again<00:02:59.830> on<00:02:59.950> nylon<00:03:00.340> we've<00:03:00.640> got<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> panel<00:03:01.180> who

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
again on nylon we've got the panel who

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.150 
again on nylon we've got the panel who
set<00:03:01.570> up<00:03:01.720> four<00:03:02.710> rows<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.480> 40-pound<00:03:04.480> nylon<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
set up four rows on 40-pound nylon and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.380 
set up four rows on 40-pound nylon and
then<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.250> move<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.760> really<00:03:07.030> big<00:03:07.150> bad

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
then you move on to the really big bad

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.650 
then you move on to the really big bad
boys<00:03:07.660> we've<00:03:08.050> got<00:03:08.140> 60<00:03:08.650> s<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:08.860> 70<00:03:09.370> hooks<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.820> wire

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
boys we've got 60 s and 70 hooks on wire

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.180 
boys we've got 60 s and 70 hooks on wire
