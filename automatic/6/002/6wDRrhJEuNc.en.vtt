00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.490
 tell these words does not appear in the 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.490
 Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.990
 against whom are you going to play 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.119
 I will give a series of words there is a 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 that is not in the dictionary of the real 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.380
 Spanish academy and go the options are 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 helicopter 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.740
 almon say 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.740
 bat 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.240
 or whiskey that is, of course, there is the baby 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.240
 contains six whiskeys 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.850
 when these words do not appear or 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.110
 that there are three that yes in the dictionary 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.110
 the real Spanish academy 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.010
 helicopter almón say bat and 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 whiskey and think that I do not tell them it 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.510
 they load for all and it seems that there are three 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.600
 that are in the dictionary of the real 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.440
 Spanish academy there is one that I do not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.369
 I ask 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.369
 very patricia 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.360
 whiskey 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.780
 so let's say that the dropper at 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 world and bat it are in the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.360
 dictionary and wake and no 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.729
 and they go 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.810
 as if it says gerardo very 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.439
 complicated 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:06.729
 but the birds could not deduce anything 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.729
 because nothing 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.470
 meatball labbé 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.850
 if they are wrong both she can not 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 go back to wrong 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.380
 I'm also interested in knowing what he thinks 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.410
 Gerardo 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.560
 the question is very complicated 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.130
 academia has accepted lately 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.210
 barbarities but it is the majesty of 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.390
 everyday language 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.580
 helicopter could be to the mont tell 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.650
 they could take it as guarantor because 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.510
 many people say tell if the right thing is 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.210
 say meatballs 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.220
 Bat it is already the reverse of music 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.050
 and whiskey I understand that it is 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.800
 accepted by the academy with nobody from 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.680
 all 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.680
 and I would add bat it 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.710
 the one that does not appear in the dictionary 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.710
 the real Spanish academy 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.859
 it's helicopter terrain we all talk 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.370
 everything is clear and in which I would have said 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:44.629
 I helicopter but because it's little of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.129
 many words that got the p 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.090
 September that's why I'm from 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.090
 helicopter 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.470
 but they are the whims of the academy of 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.120
 look what is doing things yes because 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.770
 Whiskey is an Anglicism that was 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.079
 incorporated recently by him 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.829
 phonetically but these others 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.829
 but we are human 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.870
 you know what a pity it gives me 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:16.019
 to say goodbye had everything patrician to 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:21.320
 take 10,000 and 50,000 and not 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.320
 I can be the big applause for me
