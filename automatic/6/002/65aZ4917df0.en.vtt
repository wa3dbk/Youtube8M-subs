and where he's going to put that cloud
see<00:02:03.689> I'm<00:02:03.840> checking<00:02:04.170> him<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:05.310> where

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
putting it in the back house I just need

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.690 
putting it in the back house I just need
to<00:02:08.520> stay<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:10.160> kill<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> rest<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> adds

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and then I can focus completely on where

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.820 
and then I can focus completely on where
he's<00:02:15.330> gonna<00:02:15.420> put<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.750> cloud<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> cloud

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
he's gonna put that cloud what the cloud

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.350 
he's gonna put that cloud what the cloud
does<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.220> you're<00:02:17.340> standing<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.820> cloud<00:02:18.150> at

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
does if you're standing in the cloud at

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.030 
does if you're standing in the cloud at
all<00:02:18.450> my<00:02:18.600> my<00:02:19.200> control<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.860> you'll<00:02:19.950> just

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
all my my control you and you'll just

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.570 
all my my control you and you'll just
kill<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.370> pet<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.770> saw<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> moved<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
kill your pet so I saw it moved up to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.990 
kill your pet so I saw it moved up to
the<00:02:23.670> front<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.500> moved<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> back<00:02:26.130> that's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the front so I moved to the back that's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.090 
the front so I moved to the back that's
as<00:02:27.240> complicated<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:28.860> pretty

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
as complicated as it is it's pretty

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.540 
as complicated as it is it's pretty
simple

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
simple

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.670 
simple
you<00:02:30.270> really<00:02:30.570> don't<00:02:30.720> as<00:02:30.930> close<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.410> am<00:02:31.500> right

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you really don't as close as I am right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.440 
you really don't as close as I am right
now<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> get<00:02:32.610> any<00:02:32.730> closer<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
now you do not want to get any closer to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.480 
now you do not want to get any closer to
that<00:02:33.480> cloud<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.620> any<00:02:34.830> closer<00:02:35.100> even

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
that cloud really any closer even

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.430 
that cloud really any closer even
outside<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> graphic<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
outside of the graphic a little bit it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.030 
outside of the graphic a little bit it
can<00:02:37.800> still<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.250> control<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.740> just<00:02:40.890> kind

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
can still not control you so just kind

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.920 
can still not control you so just kind
of<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.160> careful<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:44.330> that's<00:02:45.330> basically<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
of be careful there that's basically the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
of be careful there that's basically the
fight<00:02:46.140> he<00:02:46.770> goes<00:02:46.950> he's<00:02:47.220> about<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> go<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:47.790> into

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
fight he goes he's about to go back into

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.060 
fight he goes he's about to go back into
his<00:02:48.180> ground<00:02:48.450> phase<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.740> just<00:02:49.890> kind

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
his ground phase here and it's just kind

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.600 
his ground phase here and it's just kind
of<00:02:50.100> rinse<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.430> repeat<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.940> don't<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.330> any<00:02:52.610> it

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
of rinse and repeat I don't have any it

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.660 
of rinse and repeat I don't have any it
could<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.850> cleaner<00:02:54.120> kill<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.540> don't<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.900> any

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
could be a cleaner kill I don't have any

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480 
could be a cleaner kill I don't have any
bandages<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:57.150> me<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.980> kind<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
bandages on me so I just kind of have to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.890 
bandages on me so I just kind of have to
sit<00:03:00.380> sit<00:03:01.380> at<00:03:02.340> 50%<00:03:02.850> health<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> not<00:03:03.630> really

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
sit sit at 50% health and not really

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.100 
sit sit at 50% health and not really
recover<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:06.300> I'm<00:03:06.450> speeding<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> rest<00:03:07.020> of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
recover so but I'm speeding the rest of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.450 
recover so but I'm speeding the rest of
the<00:03:07.170> fight<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.100> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.310> get
