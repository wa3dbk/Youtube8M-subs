00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
working for me right now I've tried

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
working for me right now I've tried
everything<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.070> could<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.640> unit<00:01:12.119> I've

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
everything I could with this unit I've

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
everything I could with this unit I've
even<00:01:12.479> cut<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> bangs<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.770> bit

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
even cut the bangs just a little bit

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
even cut the bangs just a little bit
because<00:01:14.580> naturally<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> bangs<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:15.780> bit

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
because naturally the bangs a little bit

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
because naturally the bangs a little bit
longer<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.189> swoop<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.850> side

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
longer and a more swoop to the side

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.240 
longer and a more swoop to the side
which<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> reasons<00:01:19.560> why<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> wanted

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
which is one of the reasons why I wanted

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
which is one of the reasons why I wanted
to<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.990> once<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to get this way but then once I put it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
to get this way but then once I put it
on<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.009> head<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.640> didn't<00:01:23.970> fit<00:01:24.869> quite

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
on my head and just didn't fit quite

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
on my head and just didn't fit quite
right<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> did<00:01:26.280> cut<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> bangs<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
right so I did cut the bangs just a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.840 
right so I did cut the bangs just a
little<00:01:27.420> bit<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> could

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
little bit and try to do what I could

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.550 
little bit and try to do what I could
with<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:31.079> much<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
with it and this is pretty much what I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.330 
with it and this is pretty much what I
got<00:01:32.270> I'd<00:01:33.270> love<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> color<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.740> somehow<00:01:35.009> I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

lays really pretty nice in the bag this
is<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.540> other<00:03:00.810> side

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.900 

and<00:03:06.120> back<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.960> front<00:03:07.140> now<00:03:07.800> with<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.550> unit

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
and back to the front now with this unit

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.480 
and back to the front now with this unit
you<00:03:09.030> can<00:03:09.240> comb<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.320> whichever<00:03:10.770> way<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.070> choose

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
you can comb it whichever way you choose

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.610 
you can comb it whichever way you choose
to<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.810> try<00:03:13.110> combing<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
to is up to you I try combing it the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.380 
to is up to you I try combing it the
other<00:03:13.800> way<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.010> didn't<00:03:14.430> work<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.360> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
other way that didn't work out so I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.330 
other way that didn't work out so I
think<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.260> just<00:03:16.470> what<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.740> came<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.310> with

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
think this is just what I came up with

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.390 
think this is just what I came up with
so<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.180> don't<00:03:18.210> know<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.900> don't<00:03:19.230> love<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> color

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so I don't know I don't love the color

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.300 
so I don't know I don't love the color
but<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:22.640> don't<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.830> rare<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.070> me

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
but I don't know and this is rare for me

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.980 
but I don't know and this is rare for me
because<00:03:26.490> I<00:03:26.580> typically<00:03:26.940> typically<00:03:27.630> like

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
because I typically typically like

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.840 
because I typically typically like
everything<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.040> one<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.460> don't<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:29.700> is

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
everything but this one I don't know is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.310 
everything but this one I don't know is
I<00:03:30.030> thought<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.360> would<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.630> very<00:03:30.840> similar<00:03:31.140> to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
I thought it would be very similar to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.410 
I thought it would be very similar to
the<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.770> fringe<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.640> love<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.209> fat

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
the back fringe but I love the fat

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.150 
the back fringe but I love the fat
French<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:34.020> better<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.620> like<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.830> said<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
French much better and like I said it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.530 
French much better and like I said it
may<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> difference<00:03:35.730> between<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> colors

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
may be the difference between the colors

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.010 
may be the difference between the colors
I<00:03:37.220> don't<00:03:38.220> know<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.730> love<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.150> one<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.540> lot

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
I don't know but I love that one a lot

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.280 
I don't know but I love that one a lot
