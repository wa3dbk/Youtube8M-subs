00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
of money just in caulk to seal it but

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.730 
of money just in caulk to seal it but
it's<00:02:47.180> worth<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.540> because<00:02:47.600> it'll<00:02:48.380> hold<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
it's worth it because it'll hold and

it's worth it because it'll hold and
heat<00:02:48.890> more<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.090> caulk<00:02:50.330> pretty<00:02:50.690> much<00:02:50.950> does

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
heat more and the caulk pretty much does

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.000 
heat more and the caulk pretty much does
what<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.220> supposed<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.520> do<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:54.980> I
