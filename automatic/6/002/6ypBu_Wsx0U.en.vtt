00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.300
 steep range and super super precision 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.140
 look at the following creeper example and 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.989
 now this sword is a cool sword coupe 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.940

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.290

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:09.120
 we certainly look further so it 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.700

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:18.060

 we are an ordinary sword, but it is very very 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.620
 quickly so here so here so here 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.300
 so here so here so that the creeper 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.960
 you need to fill up so much to just 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.810
 horror 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.890
 but the joke is that every time some 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:51.590
 another color I like it too all 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.300
 after watching the following thought so because 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.630
 so so and this is also something like 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.600
