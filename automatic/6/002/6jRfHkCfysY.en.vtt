00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.100
 hello at all end had claimed a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.769
 vampire makeup on facebook 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 so we left to start I 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.679
 clear if my face 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.630
 you can do it with a background of 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.730
 dyed too light or with a white pencil 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.869
 as you want and I leave you all 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.869
 products in info bar 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.039
 now I come to fix everything with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.039
 a white powder 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.000
 I will mainly used the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.130
 palette luck 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.409
 and for starters I'm going to mix a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.829
 black makeup and a brown lighthouse to define 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.829
 my face 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.890
 after accentuating the sources there 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.540
 was going black 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.400
 I want to apply a base to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.530
 eyelids to start makeup 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.880
 eyes 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.520
 so I will start by applying a 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.440
 black blush on the mobile eyelid and I 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 then go over 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.520
 apply a farmall 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010
 2 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.209
 after fading first we go 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.620
 now apply a red lighthouse on 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.620
 the outside of makeup 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.510
 using a humidified brush game 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:33.819
 now apply this same red lighthouse 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 in the mucous membrane with black smudge and the 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.480
 lighthouse move game now traced the ras 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.049
 of lower lashes and then I go 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.489
 melt everything with the red lighthouse 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.940
 do not hesitate to go down well 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.940
 lower lashes 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.020
 I'm now re-reading the inner corner of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.340
 the eye to the rest of makeup 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.340
 thanks to a farmall 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.830
 after drawing a line liner game 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 now nothing so proud time all the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.900
 outer corner using black blush 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.650
 I'm also intensifying their axis there 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650
 inferior 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.870
 and to be sure that the underside of the eyes 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.830
 well net I go back one last time 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.349
 with my white powder I trace 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.819
 now the outer contour of the lips 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.819
 with a black pencil 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.400
 and I fill the lips with the help of a 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.400
 pencil mauges 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.390
 I'm applying here a lipstick towards 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.640
 dark jeans to unify everything and I 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.770
 will take from the red lighthouse the same as 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.500
 I put on the eyes that I apply to 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.580
 center of the lips it really gave 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580
 makeup relief 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.760
 using a lighthouse ben I trace 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.760
 now the features under the eyes 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:08.009
 and I repolish everything for an effect 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:08.009
 natural and that's it
