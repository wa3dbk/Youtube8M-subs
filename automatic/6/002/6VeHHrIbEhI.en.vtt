and it goes just here right kind of in

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.910 
and it goes just here right kind of in
the<00:02:08.210> middle<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.810> okay<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.680> first

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the middle of that you okay so the first

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.320 
the middle of that you okay so the first
thing<00:02:10.070> I'm<00:02:10.160> gonna<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.850> we're<00:02:10.970> gonna<00:02:11.030> draw

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna draw

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.690 
thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna draw
an<00:02:11.540> eight<00:02:11.960> okay<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.070> do<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
an eight okay so we do here and the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.270 
an eight okay so we do here and the
second<00:02:17.240> part<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> eight<00:02:18.530> there<00:02:18.800> doesn't

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
second part of the eight there doesn't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.280 
second part of the eight there doesn't
need<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.640> be<00:02:19.820> perfect<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.600> needs<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:20.990> fun

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
need to be perfect just needs to be fun

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.490 
need to be perfect just needs to be fun
and<00:02:21.860> let's<00:02:22.040> put<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> zero<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.270> another<00:02:23.690> zero

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and let's put a zero and another zero

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
and let's put a zero and another zero
inside<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.190> can<00:02:25.310> code<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.670> one<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
inside then you can code that one in and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.740 
inside then you can code that one in and
then<00:02:26.780> we'll<00:02:26.990> do<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> zero<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.270> we'll<00:02:29.660> do

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
then we'll do a zero here and we'll do

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.410 
then we'll do a zero here and we'll do
another<00:02:30.280> zero<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.340> color<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.970> one<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.270> there

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
another zero and color that one in there

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.370 
another zero and color that one in there
so<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:32.810> 8<00:02:33.550> 0<00:02:34.550> 0<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.570> then<00:02:36.260> 0<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.130> then<00:02:37.850> 0

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
so it's 8 0 0 and then 0 and then 0

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.520 
so it's 8 0 0 and then 0 and then 0
there<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:39.980> we're<00:02:40.400> gonna<00:02:40.520> draw<00:02:40.910> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
there it is and now we're gonna draw a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.650 
there it is and now we're gonna draw a
capital<00:02:42.530> letter<00:02:42.650> D<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.910> number<00:02:44.300> three's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
capital letter D and to number three's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.930 
capital letter D and to number three's
inside<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.350> okay<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.890> capital<00:02:46.190> D<00:02:46.459> is

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
inside of it okay so the capital D is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.070 
inside of it okay so the capital D is
kind<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.390> tall

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
kind of a tall

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.110 
kind of a tall
slightly<00:02:48.530> skinny<00:02:48.890> capital<00:02:49.370> D<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:49.850> let's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
slightly skinny capital D and then let's

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.900 
slightly skinny capital D and then let's
do<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> number<00:02:51.290> 3<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.250> right<00:02:52.640> beneath

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
do a number 3 here and right beneath

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.640 
do a number 3 here and right beneath
that<00:02:53.090> another<00:02:53.510> number<00:02:53.780> 3<00:02:54.140> those<00:02:54.290> gonna<00:02:54.470> be

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
that another number 3 those gonna be

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.620 
that another number 3 those gonna be
this<00:02:54.709> smiling<00:02:55.550> mouth<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> his<00:02:56.090> teeth<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.540> it

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
this smiling mouth and his teeth and it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.000 
this smiling mouth and his teeth and it
goes<00:02:56.750> right<00:02:56.990> around<00:02:57.110> here<00:02:57.530> okay

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
goes right around here okay

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.250 
goes right around here okay
so<00:02:58.310> first<00:02:58.550> let's<00:02:58.730> draw<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.940> capital<00:02:59.420> D<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.990> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
so first let's draw a capital D and it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.870 
so first let's draw a capital D and it
doesn't<00:03:00.620> need<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.950> as<00:03:01.040> big<00:03:01.220> as<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.520> 8th<00:03:01.700> it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
doesn't need to be as big as the 8th it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.660 
doesn't need to be as big as the 8th it
can<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> little<00:03:02.480> bit<00:03:02.600> smaller<00:03:03.280> close<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
can be a little bit smaller close to the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.110 
can be a little bit smaller close to the
top<00:03:04.880> of<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.950> there's<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.130> D<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:07.940> we're

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
top of that you there's your D now we're

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.590 
top of that you there's your D now we're
doing<00:03:08.209> number<00:03:08.540> 3<00:03:08.810> here<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.489> another<00:03:10.970> number<00:03:11.330> 3

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
doing number 3 here and another number 3

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.270 
doing number 3 here and another number 3
here<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.410> okay<00:03:12.800> if<00:03:12.830> they're<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.100> little

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
here and it's okay if they're a little

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.009 
here and it's okay if they're a little
crazy<00:03:13.610> too<00:03:13.910> because<00:03:14.090> those<00:03:14.420> minions<00:03:14.870> they
