a picture up on screen if you want to

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.740 
a picture up on screen if you want to
see<00:01:50.580> if<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.789> look<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.660> it'd<00:01:51.720> be

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
see if they look like I think it'd be

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.940 
see if they look like I think it'd be
really<00:01:51.840> cool<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.200> your<00:01:52.470> character<00:01:52.649> could

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
really cool if your character could

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.680 
really cool if your character could
actually<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.429> know<00:01:53.580> hold<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.330> be<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.629> a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
actually you know hold them be like a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.510 
actually you know hold them be like a
banner<00:01:55.289> man<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.860> Game<00:01:56.099> of<00:01:56.129> Thrones<00:01:56.220> or

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
banner man from Game of Thrones or

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.580 
banner man from Game of Thrones or
something<00:01:56.879> you<00:01:57.209> know<00:01:57.330> when<00:01:58.080> they<00:01:58.200> march<00:01:58.410> into

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
something you know when they march into

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.949 
something you know when they march into
war<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.550> can<00:01:59.729> see<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> Starks<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
war you can see like the Starks not

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.710 
war you can see like the Starks not
carrying<00:02:01.590> their<00:02:01.860> direwolf<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.910> banners<00:02:03.360> be

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
carrying their direwolf of banners be

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.820 
carrying their direwolf of banners be
really<00:02:03.929> cool<00:02:04.080> if<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.319> player<00:02:04.500> could<00:02:04.709> actually

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
really cool if a player could actually

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.650 
really cool if a player could actually
matter<00:02:05.220> how<00:02:05.459> I'm<00:02:05.520> carrying<00:02:05.910> one<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.239> but

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
matter how I'm carrying one of them but

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.119 
matter how I'm carrying one of them but
that's<00:02:06.989> just<00:02:07.080> my<00:02:07.259> opinion<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.709> think<00:02:07.739> it<00:02:08.039> would

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that's just my opinion I think it would

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's just my opinion I think it would
be<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.429> cool<00:02:08.640> feature<00:02:08.789> anyway<00:02:09.420> back<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
be a really cool feature anyway back to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
be a really cool feature anyway back to

flammable but the banner will not

flammable but the banner will not
actually<00:02:28.470> burn<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.520> can't<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.120> burned<00:02:30.330> by

actually burn up and can't be burned by
any<00:02:30.900> other<00:02:31.080> method<00:02:31.349> either<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.250> kind<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
any other method either so it kind of

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.790 
any other method either so it kind of
looks<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:33.030> flaming<00:02:33.720> banner<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
looks like a flaming banner but the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320 
looks like a flaming banner but the
banner<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.400> won't<00:02:35.550> catch<00:02:35.790> fire<00:02:35.819> won't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
banner actually won't catch fire won't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
banner actually won't catch fire won't
burn<00:02:36.450> down<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.470> pretty<00:02:37.709> much<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
burn down so it pretty much is a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
burn down so it pretty much is a
fireproof<00:02:38.970> unlike<00:02:39.480> blocks<00:02:39.989> or<00:02:40.290> fences

fireproof unlike blocks or fences

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.920 
fireproof unlike blocks or fences
banners<00:02:41.640> actually<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.150> no<00:02:42.300> collision<00:02:42.720> mask

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739

same color and of course one stick now
it's<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:03.750> easy<00:03:03.989> designed<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.620> make<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.920> I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it's very easy designed to make and I

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.930 
it's very easy designed to make and I
think<00:03:05.130> these<00:03:05.220> are<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.519> be<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:05.790> cool

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
think these are going to be really cool

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600 
think these are going to be really cool
