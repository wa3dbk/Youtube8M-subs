and<00:00:03.030> I'll<00:00:03.179> go<00:00:03.330> through<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.780> follow-up<00:00:04.319> demo<00:00:04.799> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
and I'll go through a follow-up demo to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.500 
and I'll go through a follow-up demo to
the<00:00:06.210> demo<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.660> had<00:00:06.990> just<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> few<00:00:07.379> days<00:00:07.620> ago

on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> RF<00:01:12.479> board<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.700> computer<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.970> RF

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
on the RF board so computer is on RF

on the RF board so computer is on RF
board<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> resting<00:01:16.770> state<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
board is in a resting state on and so I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
board is in a resting state on and so I
will<00:01:19.320> give<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.590> two-second<00:01:20.250> button<00:01:20.490> press<00:01:20.790> to

syncing operations I can go ahead and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.580 
syncing operations I can go ahead and
use<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.489> sync<00:02:33.790> button<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.629> order<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.140> try<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
use the sync button in order to try and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.250 
use the sync button in order to try and
sync<00:02:35.980> up<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.250> new<00:02:36.400> controller<00:02:36.879> so<00:02:37.390> I'll<00:02:37.930> give

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
sync up a new controller so I'll give

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860 
sync up a new controller so I'll give
that<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.470> press<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.099> we<00:02:39.160> should<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.870> sync

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that a press and we should see the sync

that a press and we should see the sync

in order to power on the console I would

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.990 
in order to power on the console I would

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
have to be able to hook up a 360 and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.630 
have to be able to hook up a 360 and

I then had would have to monitor in code
this<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.670> very<00:03:36.880> small<00:03:37.030> piece<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
this is just a very small piece of

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.000 
this is just a very small piece of
functionality<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:38.680> going<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.859> leave

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
functionality that I'm going to leave

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.430 
functionality that I'm going to leave
out<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.609> still<00:03:39.880> power<00:03:40.090> down<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.840> computer

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
out I can still power down the computer

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
from the Xbox's guide button thanks to

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.870 
from the Xbox's guide button thanks to
the<00:03:45.099> software<00:03:45.609> that's<00:03:45.880> built<00:03:46.389> in<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.880> just

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
the software that's built in but I just

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.120 
the software that's built in but I just
won't<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.090> able<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.450> turn<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.900> computer<00:03:50.769> on

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
won't be able to turn the computer on

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.050 
won't be able to turn the computer on
with<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.910> button<00:03:52.209> which<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.609> said<00:03:54.639> it's

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
with the button which like I said it's

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.080 
with the button which like I said it's
just<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.299> very<00:03:55.510> minor<00:03:55.750> point<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.519> future<00:03:57.700> if

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
just a very minor point in the future if

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.940 
just a very minor point in the future if
I<00:03:58.239> find<00:03:58.569> some<00:03:58.750> time<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.959> might<00:03:59.319> go<00:03:59.440> back<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.829> add

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
I find some time I might go back and add

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.610 
I find some time I might go back and add
this<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.940> would<00:04:01.209> say<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.750> most<00:04:02.380> likely

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
this but I would say that most likely

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.099 
this but I would say that most likely
not<00:04:03.040> since<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:05.109> such<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.470> minor<00:04:05.739> feature
