your final drive but remember a final

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.430 
your final drive but remember a final
drive<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.790> known<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
drive is actually known to be not really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
drive is actually known to be not really
that<00:00:40.649> good<00:00:40.920> anyways<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:42.030> maybe<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.570> faulty

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that good anyways but maybe this faulty

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
that good anyways but maybe this faulty
actually<00:00:43.469> fixed<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> problem<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
actually fixed the problem what do you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
actually fixed the problem what do you
guys<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.120> let's<00:00:45.570> find<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.170> battle

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.040 
guys think let's find out in this battle
let<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> battle<00:00:47.100> begin

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050

now<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:25.290> energy<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.310> walking<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
now your energy and I'm walking in the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210 
now your energy and I'm walking in the
middle<00:01:27.030> already<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.380> thinking<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
middle already now thinking that the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.590 
middle already now thinking that the
faultiness<00:01:29.610> might<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.510> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
faultiness might actually be at the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.760 
faultiness might actually be at the
advantage<00:01:31.170> yeah<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.710> different

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
advantage yeah but it's different

00:01:31.770 --> 00:02:01.220 
advantage yeah but it's different
because<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.610> light<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.090> wild

I<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:07.030> my<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.720> much<00:02:07.870> better<00:02:08.080> even

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
I know my just so much better even

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:31.710 
I know my just so much better even
though<00:02:09.370> it's<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:29.940> final<00:02:30.940> drive<00:02:31.090> situation

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
though it's the final drive situation

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.930 
though it's the final drive situation
they're<00:02:31.930> happening<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.560> then<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.550> like

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
they're happening and then this is like

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.460 
they're happening and then this is like
deja<00:02:34.150> vu<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.960> say<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.230> yours

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
deja vu this so would you say that yours

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.020 
deja vu this so would you say that yours
is<00:02:35.560> actually<00:02:35.860> being<00:02:35.980> faked<00:02:36.280> starting<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.790> by

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
is actually being faked starting up by

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.690 
is actually being faked starting up by
using<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.480> one<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.260> don't<00:02:38.530> know<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.190> really

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
using it one I don't know it's so really

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.630 
using it one I don't know it's so really
weird<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.300> doesn't<00:02:40.600> end<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> semi<00:02:42.370> flat

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
weird it doesn't end in the semi flat

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.920 
weird it doesn't end in the semi flat
pretty<00:02:43.000> long

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:08.130 

like<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.049> think<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:53.290> fix<00:02:53.590> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.599 

you<00:03:09.140> thought<00:03:09.260> one<00:03:09.409> let's<00:03:09.560> trade<00:03:09.799> for<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.489> two
