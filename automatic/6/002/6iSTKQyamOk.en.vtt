 i am alone body &amp; johnson 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.010
 Unfortunately, not have something to do 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.510
 Also as I said today , it's about how 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.220
 to call the bitter ad to the apple iphone 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.340
 can import touch 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.830
 it's easy to mozilla 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 You need firefox on google 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:40.100
 Enter the cappuccinos and then come 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 Almost here but fair that makes 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 would first front on itunes before a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.700
 with a right click on the ipod then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.229
 save from here 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.470
 Now this makes a backup of that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 simple you have to a little patience 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.450
 to have 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.900
 It may be a few seconds or a second 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.900
 half a minute 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.159
 that was me ratzfatz so that creates 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.170
 now first made a backup about it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.170
 now opened a path deviate 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:04.790
 names sorted by letter library 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.790

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.140
 after the accident until this text 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.210
 I also write in the video 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.580

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.120
 will wait until 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.250
 that could take a mine 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.950
 now it must follow ipod like that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.660
 production is going to work if that then 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.860
 not sleeping is something wrong 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.810
 Run right on extreme that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.690
 means there must be running again 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.690
 friends are standing 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.410

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.410

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 finished 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:15.410
 that would have now is this question 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:18.660
 you have to devote then you would have to 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:25.010
 Restore iPod stopped 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.010
 now would have the ipod of you from the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:40.350
 actually go a little bit house 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:42.630
 has to wait is completely out of this way with me 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.890
 is that now on the court so now 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.890
 it will automatically start again 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.810
 so what 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.360
 everything happens on the go out and 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.690
 tackle and run for production 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.800
 Do not push everything right just just 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.800

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.260

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:22.790
 triptis again to install 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:50.110
 that's where the apple sign comes in a bit 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:53.810
 because it takes all the data 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:58.100
 now comes under the apple sign 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:03.470
 That means it takes a bit of time 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:06.400
 needs a bit is my ipod is 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.400
