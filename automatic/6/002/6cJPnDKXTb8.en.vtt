 maintain muscle mass types of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 exercises 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 and muscle mass can be created and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.840
 maintain but also how you earn 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.150
 it can also be lost therefore not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.950
 you must only think about winning or increasing 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.480
 muscle mass but equally 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.910
 try not to lose what has been 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 gotten that is keep your mass 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
 muscular 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.860
 at the beginning the gain of greater 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.900
 musculature looks very good but at 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.839
 lose the youth what you get is 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.239
 almost an opposite effect now well 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.190
 before starting it is necessary to mention 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.160
 what is the main key of the increase 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.289
 muscle when the muscle is forced and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 he is required more work this 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 naturally he responds by increasing his 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.190
 volume in order to comply with 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 the new requirements therefore 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.989
 it's clear to think that when you stop 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.640
 do the exercises the muscle when passing 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.940
 Time decreases in size 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.040
 two types of exercises to increase 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.550
 but mostly to keep the dough 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.650
 muscular 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.260
 you have to know that there are two types of 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.830
 low impact exercises and those of 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.590
 high impact the latter is to say the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.930
 high impact are the most forced by 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.060
 example when you're looking to get more 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.340
 muscle mass here come all 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.100
 exercises where weights are lifted and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.960
 produces tension in the muscle on the other 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.909
 side are the low exercises 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 impact and here you can include 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.580
 exercises like aerobics walk in 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.710
 bicycle run among others these 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.899
 although they can not help you generate more 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.570
 muscle mass help you stay in 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.890
 way depending on how much you've 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.539
 gained muscle mass 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.300
 so you can choose your type of 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.130
 exercise for example in most 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.289
 the cases to women is 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.289
 enough to do low exercises 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.119
 impact in order to maintain the figure 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.520
 but if you are a man and you have increased 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.560
 your muscle mass significantly 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.440
 You must continue with the exercises of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.679
 moderately high impact so 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.109
 so keep this in mind 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.120
 and go to a gym with the goal of 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.939
