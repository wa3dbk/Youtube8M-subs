00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 for a youtube today I want to present you a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.370
 alternative to the guitar and is the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.370
 ukulele 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.299
 and hops is a string instrument 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.990
 of the guitar family and it's from 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.990
 Hawaiian origin 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.420
 and there are several types of cool he is for his 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.940
 size and for its sound the smallest 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.490
 acute is the soprano then the next one 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.700
 concert ukulele after the tenor 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.590
 which is how this is a little bigger and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.920
 the biggest and most serious that is the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.920
 baritone 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.790
 and on Monday you can fine-tune different 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 ways I have it with the tuning 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.420
 standard at this time what is that you 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.420
 and the 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 this is an acoustic electro ukulele 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.860
 has the cable I can connect it to a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.860
 interface or to a console 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.480
 and I was telling you that what can be a 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.420
 very good alternative to the guitar 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.820
 because it is a super-tiny instrument 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.960
 it is very practical you can take it to all 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.710
 sides do not weigh anything sounds amazing 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.619
 It is also very easy to touch because he 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.330
 the fingerboard is too small to step on 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.100
 strings is not as hard as the guitar 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.799
 it's much much smoother 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.530
 and since there are only four strings and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.830
 order in which the notes are arranged 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 of each rope is very easy to make 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.770
 chords for example of subject only pises 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 a single string this is a single 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 all right 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.660
 what are you doing as a buried kingdom 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.610
 this is a pack 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.830
 the sacks are very simple and in the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.830
 ukulele you can play absolutely 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.270
 any song you want to play 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.770
 there is no restriction because the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 instrument is a very instrument 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.989
 complete so I recommend that you 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.970
 give an opportunity what cool l in this 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.550
 moment of the loop has put a lot of 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.060
 I do not know why I 'm ever here on youtube 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.840
 also many artists are using it 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.000
 now how am I 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 in Mexico or Natalia lafourcade uses it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.720
 a lot I even have some tutorials and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.910

 of the school so you can see that it's very 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.549
 easy to touch them so that's it 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.230
