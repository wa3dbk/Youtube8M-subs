similar<00:01:16.560> logic<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:17.939> has<00:01:18.090> an

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
similar logic do you think he has an

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
similar logic do you think he has an
accent<00:01:18.600> probably<00:01:19.320> yeah<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> final

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
accent probably yeah so the final

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
accent probably yeah so the final
product<00:01:20.820> would<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> fascinating
