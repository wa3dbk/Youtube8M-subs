00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.100
 hi guys, how are you doing? 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.170
 spent just a little while from the 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.790
 news compilation and we are here 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.470
 again like the old days when 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.930
 I was uploading 23 videos a day waiting 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.670
 changed in the end I have not changed it 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.950
 wanted to make them a little more orderly 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.509
 in this season but good yes that is 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.220
 I really wanted to recover a bit that 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.660
 spark and that news wick express 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.029
 important news that is worth 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.650
 tell when it happens besides is 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.630
 coincides with one of the most 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.550
 repeated in the last days that is a 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.590
 paul will deliver the keynote through 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.399
 your website today we have known the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.690
 response from them and it's a yes 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.399
 supports through its website has already 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.190
 put as a countdown in which 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.960
 tells us precisely the time that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.340
 is for the emission to start 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.079
 they will also do through their 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.109
 web page all you need is a 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.420
 Apple computer if you have not do not 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.920
 worry also in this channel and for 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.440
 that you can have an apple computer 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 of windows or whatever here in this 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.460
 channel we will comment on the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.930
 retransmission and even if I can poke 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.750
 some image of the event although that already 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.820
 not so sure with event image 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.740
 I mean streaming the stream 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.150
 the event but surely we are guided 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.650
 by images because youtube is 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.960
 lately it 's about sensitive and the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.229
 copyright is just around the corner 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.390
 but good schedules the conference of 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.490

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.610
 the schedule in different countries of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.960
 Latin America in order that more or 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.300

 the start time of the event as 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.350

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.210
 a great emission and that of course the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.940
 theme that half is king of a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 a creates more expectation because not 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.209
 forget that and whether the site that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.739

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.470
 commented on the latest videos 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.260
 which is a site with a lot of history 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.900
 It's the 30th anniversary since it was 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.760

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.350

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.090
