say the 928 in size you can see how this

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.130 
say the 928 in size you can see how this
I<00:03:51.580> wouldn't<00:03:52.150> bring<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.420> 1020<00:03:52.900> because<00:03:53.050> I'm

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
I wouldn't bring the 1020 because I'm

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.410 
I wouldn't bring the 1020 because I'm
actually<00:03:53.260> recording<00:03:53.770> this<00:03:53.890> with<00:03:54.070> my<00:03:54.190> 1020<00:03:54.430> but

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
actually recording this with my 1020 but

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.200 
actually recording this with my 1020 but
here<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.990> size-wise<00:03:56.400> dimension<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
here it is size-wise dimension just a

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.150 
here it is size-wise dimension just a
quick<00:03:58.390> comparison<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.020> 928<00:03:59.560> it's<00:03:59.860> also<00:04:00.040> a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
quick comparison the 928 it's also a

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.270 
quick comparison the 928 it's also a
thinner<00:04:00.580> device<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.780> spread<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.410> what<00:04:03.130> we'll

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
thinner device and spread so what we'll

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.980 
thinner device and spread so what we'll
do<00:04:03.430> spend<00:04:03.790> some<00:04:03.940> time<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.450> we<00:04:04.660> should<00:04:04.840> give

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
do spend some time and we should give

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.240 
do spend some time and we should give
you<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> full<00:04:05.380> review<00:04:05.560> by<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.220> end<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.060> week
