00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.540
 we are in the restaurant etxanobe 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.920
 located in a privileged enclave in the 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.140
 euskalduna palace and in the new bilbao 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.849
 the etxanobe restaurant is a way 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.189
 different from understanding the world of 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.290
 fernando hostess channels cook and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.990
 owner runs this location from his 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.990
 opening in 1999 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.730
 but this is a catering company 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.440
 and we offer the customer an experience 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.060
 based also on the food I also say 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.280
 the food because it may seem like it's a 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.590
 restaurant to eat and eat is one of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.870
 the things that they do here but they eat 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.670
 attends you want people to be 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.130
 taste and especially that experience 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.690
 we want remember when 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.750
 people remember that they have been made 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.140
 9 there is success when they forget there 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.140
 failures 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 something that differentiates ech치nove from the rest 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 It is also your service highly 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.750
 pending of the client at all times and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.750
 very closely 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
 the technical team all the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.710
 more or less sophisticated facilities 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.560
 that you put and so high restaurants 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.590
 level and human are 23 people 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 we have waiters we have cooks 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 We have a communication department 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.970
 an innovation department that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.590
 takes to technological level and I deny and the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.590
 Kitchen level to Paul Ibarra 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 but if something does highlight 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 this high-level restaurant is without 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 doubt its innovation the ech치nove has 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.229
 introduced the ipad as a tool 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.229
 main work 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.300
 and peace is a tool that allows us 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.980
 communicate better with the client 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.920
 the client when the ech치nove comes 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.210
 before I read a letter that was a letter and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 he had to imagine 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.820
 martelly peace allows you to teach the dishes 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.720
 allows to communicate those dishes to the network 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.000
 allows to think and to know cultural 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
 and at the level of creation that is each dish 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
 what are the biggest difficulties that 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.860
 we found when inserting this 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.630
 innovation because really the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 difficulties have been few has been a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.890
 path of roses from the first day the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.150
 client has been absolutely 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 excited with the tool the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.480
 staff that uses it are the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 Waitresses has been for them 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.930
 essentials of the second day 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.940
 greater benefits have been mostly 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 customer satisfaction have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.630
 managed to communicate in a better way 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.540
 and above all we have achieved that the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.030
 people who come to the ech치nove with 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 invited those guests that for them 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.630
 they are just as important as for 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.700
 us what brings them come very 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.150
 happy because it is a tool that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 allows to transmit all the value and everything 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.250
 the knowledge of what they are eating 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 is awesome 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.830
 our future expectations are 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.720
 keep improving daily not 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.520
 never forget the most important thing 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.610
 which is that we know very little is left 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.590
 very much for learning to try to be 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.750
 the latest in innovations like 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.210
 example now we take out a tray that is 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.740
 a floating saucer because the world 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.450
 is moving so fast 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.300
 technologically that everything we can 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.490
 take to bring it closer to us and be able to 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.440
 increase the surprise of the client that is 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.150
 one of the keys of the restaurant all 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.330
 what we do is little with which face 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.930
 to the future learn to learn and not innovate 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.930
 and learn
