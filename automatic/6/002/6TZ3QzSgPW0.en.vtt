 of the nba landi ei is structured in a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 abnormal way you play a lot of

 matches in the so-called regular season 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.860
 but that doesn't make you win anything 82 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 team parties then start again from 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.029

 regolar season paola played so well 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.019

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.819
 here then is the true trophy of the 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.309
 season is the mvp of the finals 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.569

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.299
 your school has won there is only one 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.519
 exception jerry west defeated with i 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.469
 his lakers against the boston celtics but 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.479
 for some years now that

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.680
 Incredible player as a coach 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 player today is unthinkable but then 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.260
 no and it was the first in 1966 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.590
 African American coach of history 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.960
 of professional sports uses but 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.880
 behind that trophy there is a very history 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.730
 particular 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.850
 bill had originally married one 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.320
 black america mass had been short-lived 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.130
 strong personality made him to his 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 way 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.060
 she had been worse without a companion 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 official for some time 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 good morning I met in jewelry that is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.430
 a bad place to meet a woman 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.640
 because in it's rough you are not there to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.580
 she a certain marilyn approached 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 berlin said I could make you a secretary 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.960
 if yours maybe one day 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 stop when she stopped she becomes the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.909
 secretary and from there his wife the second 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.830
 wife the woman of his life but 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.020
 russell who grew up in Louisiana 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.360
 segregated and has a dreadful DNA 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.730
 survived all of me too that is 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.499

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.510
 cancer received a call from david 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.909
 stern the nba commissioner 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.909
 credits marilyn we decided to 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:24.569
 to name the most coveted honor 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.469
 of the nba or mp of the possessed 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.379
 poor both of the playoffs to your husband 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.370
 practically gives her the last orchid 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.219
 beautiful before the trip 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.920
 last night berlin the odyssey bill 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:41.040
 russell at the last moment without that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.409
 nice to know if bill is something to tell you 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.779
 and they were really have to leave 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:51.180
 most important efficiency to the possible 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.420
 russell that they were hard than seeing each other 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.609
 he didn't give them, he started to cry and then 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 he called David stern to thank him 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.480
 because it was the best gift he could 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.999
 do blackbirds and say america in first 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.189
