to drop it from there as well and lastly

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
to drop it from there as well and lastly
we're<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> let<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.870> slip<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're going to let it slip out of the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.279 
we're going to let it slip out of the
hand<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:47.010> five<00:00:47.579> foot<00:00:47.850> six<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.420> five<00:00:48.930> foot<00:00:49.079> nine

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so it's around five foot six to show how

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
so it's around five foot six to show how
it<00:00:51.480> handles<00:00:51.750> impact<00:00:52.110> from<00:00:52.289> such<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> height<00:00:52.770> all

those three things combined will paint

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
those three things combined will paint
the<00:00:55.739> most<00:00:55.890> realistic<00:00:56.250> portrayal<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> how

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
from the reverse initial drop test

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.460 
from the reverse initial drop test
alright<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.390> no<00:01:17.540> shattering<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.170> display

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.809 
it from five foot six at the air let's
see<00:03:41.570> how<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.810> goes

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.550 

you<00:03:50.239> know<00:03:50.360> I've<00:03:50.810> really<00:03:51.080> got<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.290> hand<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.530> to

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
you know I've really got to hand it to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.809 
you know I've really got to hand it to
Apple<00:03:52.000> device<00:03:53.000> itself<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.510> still<00:03:53.720> functioning

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
Apple device itself is still functioning

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.190 
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's<00:03:55.819> see<00:03:56.000> where<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.209> moment<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.569> point<00:03:57.140> of

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
let's see where the moment of point of

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.730 
let's see where the moment of point of
impact<00:03:57.470> was

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.550 

all<00:04:01.100> right<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.820> appears<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.270> yeah<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:03.440> know

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
all right it appears so yeah you know

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.770 
all right it appears so yeah you know
it's<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.370> really<00:04:04.580> learn<00:04:04.730> cloud<00:04:04.940> device<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.450> just

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it's a really learn cloud device I just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.850 
it's a really learn cloud device I just
to<00:04:05.840> stay<00:04:05.960> a<00:04:05.990> little<00:04:06.140> bit<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.410> damage<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.740> the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
to stay a little bit of damage on the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.680 
to stay a little bit of damage on the
side<00:04:07.070> we<00:04:07.640> had<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.790> first<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.330> second<00:04:08.630> point

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
side we had the first the second point

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.450 
side we had the first the second point
of<00:04:08.870> impact<00:04:09.050> was<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:10.070> first<00:04:10.280> point

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
of impact was here and the first point

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.880 
of impact was here and the first point
of<00:04:10.520> impact<00:04:10.760> was<00:04:11.080> actually<00:04:12.080> excuse<00:04:12.380> me<00:04:12.560> this

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
of impact was actually excuse me this

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.230 
of impact was actually excuse me this
appears<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.340> actually<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.880> point<00:04:14.090> of

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
appears to be actually the point of

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.970 
appears to be actually the point of
impact<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.780> whereas<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.650> from<00:04:15.890> the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
impact and whereas you know from the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.060 
impact and whereas you know from the
galaxy<00:04:16.370> s3<00:04:16.640> is<00:04:17.060> smash<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:18.110> iPhone<00:04:18.410> 5<00:04:18.620> appears

to<00:04:19.790> sustain<00:04:20.180> relatively<00:04:20.810> minimal<00:04:20.930> damage<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
to sustain relatively minimal damage the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.140

LCD itself is still completely

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.970 
LCD itself is still completely
functioning<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.170> just<00:04:24.410> minor<00:04:24.590> aesthetic

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
functioning it's just minor aesthetic

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.310 
functioning it's just minor aesthetic
damage<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.970> bezel<00:04:26.120> itself<00:04:26.600> which<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.170> made

Samsung<00:04:34.130> Galaxy<00:04:34.520> has<00:04:34.610> three<00:04:34.850> time<00:04:35.030> again

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
Samsung Galaxy has three time again

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.910 
Samsung Galaxy has three time again
we're<00:04:35.990> going<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.140> drop<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.500> from<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.770> height

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
we're going to drop it from the height

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.550 
we're going to drop it from the height
of<00:04:37.040> my<00:04:37.130> ear<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.670> retrain<00:04:38.600> realistic<00:04:39.110> drop<00:04:39.290> test

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
of my ear to retrain realistic drop test

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.650 
of my ear to retrain realistic drop test
scenario<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.190> will<00:04:40.610> be<00:04:40.730> five<00:04:40.910> foot<00:04:41.150> six<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
scenario I will be five foot six of the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:50.380 
scenario I will be five foot six of the
year<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.770> let's<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:43.070> see<00:04:43.250> how<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.400> fares

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.630 

so<00:04:50.480> as<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:50.660> can<00:04:50.750> see<00:04:50.810> yeah<00:04:51.710> just<00:04:52.310> from<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.490> side

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
so as we can see yeah just from the side

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.180 
so as we can see yeah just from the side
here<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.030> did<00:04:53.240> crack<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.510> little<00:04:53.660> bit<00:04:53.870> more<00:04:54.190> it

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
here it did crack a little bit more it

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.980 
here it did crack a little bit more it
appears<00:04:55.310> as<00:04:55.640> though<00:04:55.850> yeah<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.570> impact<00:04:56.870> was

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
appears as though yeah the impact was

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.810 
appears as though yeah the impact was
here<00:04:57.200> on<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.410> side<00:04:57.620> which<00:04:58.340> cause<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.670> glass

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
here on the side which cause the glass

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.370 
here on the side which cause the glass
to<00:04:58.880> fracture<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.420> little<00:04:59.600> bit<00:04:59.690> more<00:04:59.870> but<00:05:00.290> it

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
to fracture a little bit more but it

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.870 
to fracture a little bit more but it
just<00:05:00.530> compounded<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.160> fractures<00:05:01.670> to<00:05:01.850> the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
just compounded the fractures to the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.360 
just compounded the fractures to the
point<00:05:02.150> where<00:05:02.390> they<00:05:02.780> extend<00:05:03.380> all<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.590> way<00:05:04.070> down

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
point where they extend all the way down

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.240 
point where they extend all the way down
the<00:05:04.610> device<00:05:04.880> itself<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.590> rear<00:05:06.770> yeah

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
the device itself to the rear yeah

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.730 
the device itself to the rear yeah
obviously<00:05:07.760> not<00:05:08.270> very<00:05:08.300> much<00:05:08.570> damage<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.500> case

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
obviously not very much damage the case

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.020 
obviously not very much damage the case
really<00:05:10.070> no<00:05:10.250> one<00:05:10.370> cares<00:05:10.580> about<00:05:10.730> it's<00:05:10.970> just

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
really no one cares about it's just

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.260 
really no one cares about it's just
cheap<00:05:11.450> plastic<00:05:11.810> really<00:05:12.080> anyway<00:05:12.580> but<00:05:13.580> yeah<00:05:13.700> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.520 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the
screen<00:05:14.480> itself<00:05:14.660> is<00:05:14.810> still<00:05:14.960> functioning<00:05:15.440> so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
screen itself is still functioning so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.780 
screen itself is still functioning so
that's<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.770> really<00:05:15.950> good<00:05:16.040> sign<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.400> internals

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
that's a really good sign the internals

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.720 
that's a really good sign the internals
are<00:05:16.820> obviously<00:05:17.210> okay<00:05:17.890> but<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.520> just

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
are obviously okay but it just

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.430 
are obviously okay but it just
compounded<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.270> impact<00:05:20.600> uh<00:05:20.810> and<00:05:21.080> just<00:05:21.110> made

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
compounded the impact uh and just made

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.690 
compounded the impact uh and just made
all<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.680> cracks<00:05:21.920> just<00:05:22.130> go<00:05:22.250> down<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.460> little

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
all the cracks just go down a little

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.460 
all the cracks just go down a little
farther<00:05:22.970> down<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.510> length<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.110> display

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
farther down the length of the display

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.270 
farther down the length of the display
so<00:05:25.400> Samsung<00:05:26.180> s3<00:05:26.480> unfortunately<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.470> pretty

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
so Samsung s3 unfortunately is in pretty

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.590 
so Samsung s3 unfortunately is in pretty
tough<00:05:28.460> shape<00:05:28.520> right<00:05:28.880> now<00:05:28.910> relative<00:05:29.420> to<00:05:29.510> the

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
tough shape right now relative to the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.460 
tough shape right now relative to the
iPhone<00:05:29.930> 5<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:31.120> am<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.330> iPhone<00:05:32.720> 5<00:05:32.930> held<00:05:33.200> up<00:05:33.320> well

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
iPhone 5 I am the iPhone 5 held up well

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.680 
iPhone 5 I am the iPhone 5 held up well
during<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.770> drop<00:05:33.950> test<00:05:34.160> my<00:05:34.430> god<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.420> we're
