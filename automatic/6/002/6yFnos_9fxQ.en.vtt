00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.430 

so<00:00:01.920> I'm<00:00:02.310> using<00:00:02.850> today<00:00:03.270> number<00:00:03.720> 10<00:00:04.080> pearl

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
so I'm using today number 10 pearl

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.820 
so I'm using today number 10 pearl
cotton<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:05.670> blue<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:07.200> taken<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.740> I've

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
cotton in blue and I've taken and I've

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.089 
cotton in blue and I've taken and I've
measured<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.760> gotten<00:00:09.540> an<00:00:09.840> approximation<00:00:10.620> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
measured and gotten an approximation of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.759 
measured and gotten an approximation of
two<00:00:11.730> times<00:00:12.059> around<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.990> distance<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.559> my

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
two times around the distance of my

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.060 
two times around the distance of my
rectangle<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.610> then<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> folded<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.719> half

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
rectangle and then I folded it in half

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
rectangle and then I folded it in half
and<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.430> was<00:00:17.640> created<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.539> loop<00:00:18.779> for

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and that was created a little loop for

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.670 
and that was created a little loop for
me<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.470> also<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> needle<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.630> thread<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
me I also have a needle with thread and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
me I also have a needle with thread and
it<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.369> tied<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> knot<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it is tied in the knot so that I have a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
it is tied in the knot so that I have a
free<00:00:25.350> end<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.949> knotted<00:00:26.340> end<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.930> thread

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
free end and a knotted end on the thread

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
free end and a knotted end on the thread
and<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.250> insert<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> needle<00:00:30.090> from<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> back

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and so I insert the needle from the back

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
and so I insert the needle from the back
of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.920> cloth<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> way<00:00:32.820> through<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of the cloth all the way through the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.440 
of the cloth all the way through the
cloth<00:00:33.649> to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> front<00:00:35.190> along<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
cloth to the front along one of the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.670 
cloth to the front along one of the
lines<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.430> starting<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> center<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
lines and I'm starting in the center of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.049 
lines and I'm starting in the center of
the<00:00:40.680> line<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.760> bulky

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the line because it's a little bulky

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
the line because it's a little bulky
when<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> very<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> I've

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
when you end up at the very end and I've

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.180 
when you end up at the very end and I've
got<00:00:44.309> room<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.030> bulk<00:00:45.860> away<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
got room to have that bulk away from the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360 
got room to have that bulk away from the
corner<00:00:48.230> once<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> thread<00:00:50.010> through

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
corner once I have the thread through

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330 
corner once I have the thread through
the<00:00:50.660> pattern<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> loop<00:00:53.010> on

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the pattern I'm going to put the loop on

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.290 
the pattern I'm going to put the loop on
that<00:00:53.660> thread<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:00:59.789> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> go

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that thread and then I'm going to go

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
that thread and then I'm going to go
back<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.870> through<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> entire<00:01:02.000> pattern<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
back down through the entire pattern and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.530 
back down through the entire pattern and
cloth<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.890> close<00:01:05.369> stitch<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
cloth in a very close stitch to the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
cloth in a very close stitch to the
original<00:01:07.260> thread<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> came<00:01:08.040> through<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> want

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
original thread that came through I want

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.100 
original thread that came through I want
very<00:01:08.790> small<00:01:09.270> stitches<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.659> I've<00:01:12.780> anchored

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
very small stitches so now I've anchored

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
very small stitches so now I've anchored
that<00:01:13.530> loop<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> move<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.450> now

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that loop and I'm going to move it now

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
that loop and I'm going to move it now
out<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> way<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.860> come<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.340> again<00:01:17.759> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
out of the way and come up again from

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
out of the way and come up again from
the<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.659> side<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.680> clock<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.580> way

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the back side of the clock all the way

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
the back side of the clock all the way
through<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> paper<00:01:21.420> pattern<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.799> line

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
through the paper pattern on the line

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
through the paper pattern on the line
and<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.939> tricky<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and this is a little tricky and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
and this is a little tricky and
sometimes<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.140> put<00:01:25.439> numerous<00:01:25.950> holes

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
sometimes you have to put numerous holes

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.999 
sometimes you have to put numerous holes
to<00:01:26.490> find<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> line<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.170> does<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.590> easier

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to find that line it does get easier

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
to find that line it does get easier
after<00:01:29.250> you've<00:01:29.490> gotten<00:01:29.729> started<00:01:30.229> come<00:01:31.229> up

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
after you've gotten started come up

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.429 
after you've gotten started come up
through<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.930> pull<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> thread

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
through from the back pull the thread

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.560 
through from the back pull the thread
through<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:35.369> lay<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:37.400> coordinates<00:01:38.570> your

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
through now lay your coordinates your

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.289 
through now lay your coordinates your
actual<00:01:40.020> needle<00:01:40.259> lace<00:01:40.439> threads<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
actual needle lace threads up out of the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
actual needle lace threads up out of the
way<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.619> back<00:01:43.860> down

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
way so that you can see and go back down

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
way so that you can see and go back down
almost<00:01:44.640> through<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> same<00:01:45.630> hole<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
almost through the same hole that you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.840 
almost through the same hole that you
came<00:01:46.590> through<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.490> through

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
came through and go all the way through

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.410 
came through and go all the way through
the<00:01:48.570> cloth<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> back<00:01:49.920> side<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.180> as

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the cloth to the back side and now as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.100 
the cloth to the back side and now as
you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:55.280> hopefully<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.719> made<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you can see hopefully I have made a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.209 
you can see hopefully I have made a
stitch<00:01:58.469> across<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.280> two<00:01:59.490> threads<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:01.259> going

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
stitch across the two threads I'm going

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
stitch across the two threads I'm going
to<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.490> come<00:02:03.060> back<00:02:03.090> through<00:02:03.570> again<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to then come back through again on the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.840 
to then come back through again on the
line<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> repeat<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> process

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
line and repeat this process

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.589 
line and repeat this process
placing<00:02:06.719> stitches<00:02:07.259> every<00:02:08.330> quarter<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.479> an
