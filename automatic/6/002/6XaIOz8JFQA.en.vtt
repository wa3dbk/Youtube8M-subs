here<00:00:00.269> we're<00:00:00.659> gonna<00:00:00.750> apply<00:00:01.140> science<00:00:01.650> something

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
here we're gonna apply science something

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.670 
here we're gonna apply science something
very<00:00:02.280> useful<00:00:02.460> making<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.449> man<00:00:03.689> fall<00:00:04.170> for<00:00:04.529> you

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
very useful making a man fall for you

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.410 
very useful making a man fall for you
now<00:00:05.100> obviously<00:00:05.370> we're<00:00:05.580> targeting<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.180> or

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
now obviously we're targeting this or

now obviously we're targeting this or
the<00:00:06.540> article<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.870> should<00:00:07.049> say<00:00:07.200> from<00:00:07.379> her

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the article I should say from her

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.650 
the article I should say from her
campus.com<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.280> targeted<00:00:08.820> at<00:00:08.910> using<00:00:09.120> science

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
campus.com is targeted at using science

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.080 
campus.com is targeted at using science
to<00:00:09.840> attract<00:00:10.139> men<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:11.040> women<00:00:11.160> but<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> lot<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
to attract men for women but a lot of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.060 
to attract men for women but a lot of
the<00:00:12.210> stuff<00:00:12.420> could<00:00:12.630> as<00:00:12.809> easily<00:00:12.840> be<00:00:13.559> used<00:00:13.799> if

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the stuff could as easily be used if

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.890 
the stuff could as easily be used if
your<00:00:14.250> man<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.969> stay<00:00:15.570> tuned

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
your man so stay tuned

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.070 
your man so stay tuned
um<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:17.460> body<00:00:17.940> language

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
um the first is to use body language

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.450 
um the first is to use body language
because<00:00:19.080> other<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.619> talk<00:00:19.740> about<00:00:19.859> pheromones

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
because other they talk about pheromones

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.189 
because other they talk about pheromones
here<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.060> there's<00:00:21.180> also<00:00:21.330> little<00:00:21.630> things<00:00:21.750> like

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
here and there's also little things like

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.750 
here and there's also little things like
signals<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.100> interest<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:24.320> yeah<00:00:25.760> like

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
signals of interest like yeah like

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.220 
signals of interest like yeah like
touching<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.300> hair<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> things<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
touching your hair and things like that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
touching your hair and things like that
um<00:00:28.920> these<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.310> things<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.330> brain<00:00:30.510> sort

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
um these are things that the brain sort

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
um these are things that the brain sort
of<00:00:31.019> understands<00:00:31.740> means<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.340> someone's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of understands means that someone's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
of understands means that someone's
interested<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.870> fake<00:00:34.079> them<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.440> as

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
interested you can fake them just as

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
interested you can fake them just as
easy<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:35.370> something<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.820> simple<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.120> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
easy like something as simple as I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
easy like something as simple as I
talked<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.500> you're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
talked about how on when you're

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.110 
talked about how on when you're
interested<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.100> someone<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> blink<00:00:38.910> more

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
interested in someone you blink more

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.170 
interested in someone you blink more
often<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.680> force<00:00:41.070> yourself<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> blink

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
often so you can force yourself to blink

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
often so you can force yourself to blink
more<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.140> show<00:00:43.350> someone<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.040> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
more to show someone that you're in that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.690 
more to show someone that you're in that
that<00:00:44.700> sounds<00:00:45.210> disastrous<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.200> buzz<00:00:46.469> about

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
that sounds disastrous do not buzz about

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
that sounds disastrous do not buzz about
potentially<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.989> potentially

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
potentially all of these are potentially

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
potentially all of these are potentially
disaster<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:51.360> using

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
disaster right but if you look using

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
disaster right but if you look using
heart<00:00:52.260> depsite<00:00:52.710> harnessing<00:00:53.460> science<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.149> both

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
heart depsite harnessing science is both

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
heart depsite harnessing science is both
the<00:00:54.510> potential<00:00:54.780> benefit<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> potential<00:00:55.620> risk

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the potential benefit the potential risk

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
the potential benefit the potential risk
you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.129> celery<00:00:56.460> powers<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you know celery powers so in this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.279 
you know celery powers so in this
context<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.890> letting<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.910> guy<00:01:00.120> know

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
context you are letting the guy know

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
context you are letting the guy know
that<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.649> attracted<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.489> him<00:01:02.820> yeah<00:01:03.210> but

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that you are attracted to him yeah but

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
that you are attracted to him yeah but
how<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.260> him<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.830> attracted<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
how do you get him to be attracted to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
how do you get him to be attracted to
you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> idea<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:07.530> are

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you know but the idea is that these are

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
you know but the idea is that these are
things<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.400> clue<00:01:08.700> him<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.479> you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
things that will clue him in that you're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
things that will clue him in that you're
interested<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.290> possibly<00:01:10.890> make<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
interested in possibly make you make a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.620 
interested in possibly make you make a
move<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> say<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.540> instance

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
move or something like say for instance

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
move or something like say for instance
using<00:01:13.080> pheromones<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> might<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
using pheromones you might not want to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
using pheromones you might not want to
shower<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:15.299> might<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> wear<00:01:16.049> underwear

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
shower you might want to wear underwear

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
shower you might want to wear underwear
for<00:01:16.799> few<00:01:16.979> days<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> row<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
for few days in a row something like

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
for few days in a row something like
that<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.450> harness<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> power<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that and you harness the power that to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
that and you harness the power that to
draw<00:01:20.280> him<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.820> okay<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
draw him in okay so you know that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
draw him in okay so you know that
doesn't<00:01:22.680> work<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:22.920> forget<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.610> there

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
doesn't work as well forget you there

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
doesn't work as well forget you there
are<00:01:24.150> other<00:01:24.420> things<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.960> list<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.409> John

will get to I can't help myself have to
jump<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.369> experience<00:01:30.060> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
jump in in my experience with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
jump in in my experience with
communicating<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.079> men<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:32.299> doing<00:01:33.299> these

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
communicating with men okay doing these

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.289 
communicating with men okay doing these
little<00:01:33.810> tricky<00:01:34.259> Pezzini<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.400> hints<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
little tricky Pezzini like hints and

little tricky Pezzini like hints and
things<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.670> work<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
things like that it does not work you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
things like that it does not work you
gotta<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.780> straightforward<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

natural<00:01:51.930> Bend<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:54.560> usually<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.920> should<00:01:56.130> just

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
natural Bend but usually you should just

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
natural Bend but usually you should just
be<00:01:56.490> straightforward<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.210> guys<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> let

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
be straightforward with guys and let

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
be straightforward with guys and let
them<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
them know what you want right so and I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.399 
them know what you want right so and I
know<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.750> difficult<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.229> do

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
know that that's difficult to do

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.810 
know that that's difficult to do
especially<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.219> guy<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.700> you're

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
especially if it's a guy that you're

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.569 
especially if it's a guy that you're
interested<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:05.189> tell<00:02:05.369> them

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
interested in but you just tell them

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.570 
interested in but you just tell them
like<00:02:05.820> hey<00:02:06.229> let's<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.350> coffee<00:02:07.590> cut<00:02:08.220> into<00:02:08.520> you

like hey let's get coffee cut into you
right<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.039> are

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
right I think that but then there are

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
right I think that but then there are
dudes<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.580> unattracted<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> like

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
dudes that are unattracted to that like

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
dudes that are unattracted to that like
yeah<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.379> can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
yeah they can

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
yeah they can
put<00:02:14.130> someone<00:02:14.430> off<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:14.850> right<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.780> guys<00:02:15.990> wanna

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
put someone off like right so guys wanna

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.680 
put someone off like right so guys wanna
chase<00:02:16.530> -<00:02:17.060> maybe<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.209> they're<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
chase - maybe not they're going to the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.210 
chase - maybe not they're going to the
bar<00:02:18.870> something<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.069> you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
bar something like that but if you're

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.620 
bar something like that but if you're
meeting<00:02:20.430> him<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.760> class<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> everything<00:02:21.390> if

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
meeting him in class and everything if

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.240 
meeting him in class and everything if
you<00:02:21.720> come<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:21.900> too<00:02:22.020> strong<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.470> might<00:02:22.890> he

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you come on too strong you might he

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.100 
you come on too strong you might he
might<00:02:23.459> have<00:02:23.760> sex<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.209> yeah<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.990> might

might have sex with you yeah that might

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.260 
might have sex with you yeah that might
be<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> ended<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.130> these<00:02:26.550> are<00:02:26.730> things<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.120> sort

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
be the ended so these are things to sort

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.790 
be the ended so these are things to sort
of<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.540> try<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.750> uh<00:02:27.870> develop<00:02:28.230> something<00:02:28.560> more

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
of like try to uh develop something more

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.390 
of like try to uh develop something more
long-lasting

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
long-lasting

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
long-lasting
yeah<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.120> second<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.020> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
yeah the second in this one I think is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.140 
yeah the second in this one I think is
so<00:02:31.290> funny<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.860> they<00:02:32.250> say<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> copycat

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so funny is that they say be a copycat

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550 
so funny is that they say be a copycat
whether<00:02:33.600> basically<00:02:34.020> saying<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.380> there's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
whether basically saying is there's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.530 
whether basically saying is there's
quite<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.459> science<00:02:35.670> says<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.209> people

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
quite a bit of science says that people

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170 
quite a bit of science says that people
like<00:02:36.780> people<00:02:37.380> who<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:38.100> certain<00:02:38.520> mirroring

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
like people who do certain mirroring

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.420 
like people who do certain mirroring
techniques<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:40.230> people<00:02:40.590> who<00:02:40.650> talk<00:02:40.680> similar

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
techniques like people who talk similar

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.030 
techniques like people who talk similar
to<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.760> are<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.450> similar<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.230> expressions

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to them are you similar like expressions

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.100 
to them are you similar like expressions
or<00:02:44.340> hand<00:02:44.850> motions<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.480> things<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
or hand motions and things like that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.900 
or hand motions and things like that
this<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.530> actually<00:02:46.830> lampooned<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.459> an<00:02:47.610> episode

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
this is actually lampooned in an episode

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.350 
this is actually lampooned in an episode
of<00:02:48.060> The<00:02:48.180> Office<00:02:48.209> where<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.800> was<00:02:50.040> Andy<00:02:50.520> was<00:02:51.150> like

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
of The Office where it was Andy was like

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
of The Office where it was Andy was like
trying<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.019> mirror<00:02:52.590> his<00:02:53.250> boss<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
trying to like mirror his boss and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.190 
trying to like mirror his boss and
didn't<00:02:54.000> work<00:02:54.120> well<00:02:54.269> for<00:02:54.420> him<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.840> imagine

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
didn't work well for him and I imagine

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.630 
didn't work well for him and I imagine
is<00:02:55.320> another<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.830> whereas<00:02:56.130> he<00:02:56.280> said<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.550> could

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
is another one whereas he said it could

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.110 
is another one whereas he said it could
go<00:02:56.790> horribly<00:02:57.120> wrong<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:59.700> he<00:02:59.880> use<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
go horribly wrong like if he use a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.850 
go horribly wrong like if he use a
certain<00:03:00.510> expression<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.709> same

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
certain expression and you use the same

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.860 
certain expression and you use the same
expression<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.489> could<00:03:02.880> make<00:03:03.120> him<00:03:03.300> feel<00:03:03.600> more

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
expression that could make him feel more

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.690 
expression that could make him feel more
comfortable<00:03:04.290> or<00:03:04.470> more<00:03:04.650> familiar<00:03:05.040> yeah<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:05.610> if

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
comfortable or more familiar yeah but if

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.250 
comfortable or more familiar yeah but if
he<00:03:05.820> notices<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.390> that's<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.900> look<00:03:07.080> really

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
he notices that that's gonna look really

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.870 
he notices that that's gonna look really
bad<00:03:07.380> yeah<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.320> instead<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.730> mimicking<00:03:11.730> that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
bad yeah I and instead of mimicking that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.600 
bad yeah I and instead of mimicking that
person<00:03:12.360> or<00:03:12.510> copying<00:03:12.930> his<00:03:13.380> or<00:03:13.530> her<00:03:13.709> style<00:03:14.250> or

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
person or copying his or her style or

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.940 
person or copying his or her style or
speaking<00:03:15.060> style<00:03:15.300> whatever<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> maybe<00:03:16.709> it's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
speaking style whatever it is maybe it's

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.000 
speaking style whatever it is maybe it's
a<00:03:17.070> good<00:03:17.250> idea<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.750> find<00:03:18.750> common<00:03:19.140> interest<00:03:19.739> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
a good idea to find common interest so
