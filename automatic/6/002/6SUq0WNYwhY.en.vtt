00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that's pretty starchy enough to create a

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.459 
that's pretty starchy enough to create a
creamy<00:00:57.920> texture<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:58.610> risotto<00:00:59.170> so<00:01:00.170> I'm<00:01:00.320> just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.000 

and<00:02:29.719> the<00:02:30.719> final<00:02:30.930> step<00:02:31.409> I'm<00:02:31.620> going<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.860> add<00:02:31.980> some

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and the final step I'm going to add some

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.140 
and the final step I'm going to add some
Parmesan<00:02:32.670> cheese<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:34.189> usually<00:02:35.189> use<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:35.849> type

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
Parmesan cheese I usually use this type

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
Parmesan cheese I usually use this type
of<00:02:36.180> Parmesan<00:02:36.930> cheese<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.620> freshly<00:02:37.950> shredded

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
of Parmesan cheese it's freshly shredded

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.280 
of Parmesan cheese it's freshly shredded
already<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.090> i<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.750> shred<00:02:40.140> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
already so i don't have to shred it
