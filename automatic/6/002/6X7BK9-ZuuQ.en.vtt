00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
day like care like we've got right now

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.819 
day like care like we've got right now
and<00:01:41.790> around<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.390> 23<00:01:42.930> degrees<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.710> these

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
and around about 23 degrees so all these

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.609 
and around about 23 degrees so all these
factors<00:01:44.189> play<00:01:44.430> into<00:01:44.460> account<00:01:45.030> our<00:01:45.619> skippers

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
factors play into account our skippers

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
factors play into account our skippers
have<00:01:46.740> told<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.280> given<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have told us that's given the the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
have told us that's given the the
strength<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> tide<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.829> should<00:01:50.040> be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
strength of the tide we should be

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
strength of the tide we should be
expecting<00:01:50.689> an<00:01:51.689> additional<00:01:52.200> time<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> around

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
expecting an additional time of around

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
expecting an additional time of around
about<00:01:52.799> an<00:01:53.040> hour<00:01:53.189> maybe<00:01:53.520> even<00:01:53.729> hour<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> half

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
about an hour maybe even hour and a half

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760 
about an hour maybe even hour and a half
or<00:01:54.390> two<00:01:54.600> hours<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.649> could

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
or two hours on what we could

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
or two hours on what we could
potentially<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> tides<00:01:57.329> being<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
potentially do had the tides being a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
potentially do had the tides being a
little<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:57.960> lower<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.290> people<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.399> always

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
little bit lower so people will always

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
little bit lower so people will always
ask<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> question<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.840> swim<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> English

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
ask the question if we swim the English

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.730 
ask the question if we swim the English

such a hard answer to be able to give I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
such a hard answer to be able to give I
know<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.259> myself<00:02:07.619> how<00:02:07.799> well<00:02:08.039> I'm<00:02:08.160> swimming<00:02:08.369> at
