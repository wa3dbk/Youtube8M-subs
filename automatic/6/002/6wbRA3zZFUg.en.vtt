00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.910
 this anime was just right 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.890
 my apologies so sorry now 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.750
 wortwahl to the just is solely on 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.780
 the fifth episode is camcorder 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.690
 Just connect so I do not know 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.580
 blatantly so I just found him mega 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.190
 emotional and I think it has everything 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.500
 also really great brought over to 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.510
 fifth episode one comes so first in 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.580
 the whole concept that means we 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.260
 yes have these five friends in the 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.480
 student culture club and one day 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.520
 experience here a phenomenon namely that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.890
 who swap the body to say it in 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.620
 the halls a short time later arises 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.850
 then out that's from the heart sammer 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.980
 it seems like an alien 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.290
 was done and put that makes 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 because he enjoys watching it 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.490
 and he finds the five members of 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.260
 pretty much to the student kulturclub 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.750
 interesting I personally think that 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 connections between theory and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.880
 animal excrement quite interesting what not 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.430
 means that the relationship between audi 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.930
 and juhui are worse because i think 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.340
 they just interested me more 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.260
 and I found the a profile more complex 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.909
 just the character design it has me 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.729
 very good as well with the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.710
 You absolutely can not do any animations 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.630
 complain because as silver link really 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.550
 wonderful job done and yourself 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.500
 Link is now in the meantime part 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.479
 creates by some as a second 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.360
 acted and I have to say we are 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.729
 not quite as violent with the art though 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.010
 I think the way silver left the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.140
 animes is doing very well so now too 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.060
 The music we connect with their kokoro connect 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.010
 in the anime is actually synonymous 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 pretty great that opening has me too 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.180
 very confident and I have to be honest 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.890
 admit that I found lenting too 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.049
 really cool but there I found the second 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.450
 but also not better at the july then 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.920
 to be surrounded by the chocolate 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 I've seen what I do 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.330
 In any case, I found the better connect 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.680
 he then has four special episodes 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.750
 got that means now a 17 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.369
 episodes kokoro connect and I think 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.560
 this 17 the sun really has it 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.090
 what is just sooo wonderful i am 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.740
 personally wish me one more 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 season but actually in principle 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.820
 not because the end actually 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.740
 It has been pretty much completed though 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.450
 still some gaps left on 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.860
 For example, that would be heart sammer 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.319
 would have me too, for example 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.110
 But yes, yes that was one too 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.030
 part of that that so mysterious over 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.890
 and therefore the whole thing is not cleared up 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.590
 but I was still there in person 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.810
 but I do not like to know it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.640
 much of the evaluation from conclusion corel 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.160
 connect in my opinion one 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.220
 absolute must and one of the best 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.110
 anime from the year 2012 who still has it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 did not necessarily have to see 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.260
 look into 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 whether you romance does not like but may 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.250
 It's just a matter of opinion 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.930
 absolute experience kokoro connect is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.490
 just have to be so aware of him there 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380
 I'll definitely go back 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.090
 watching the music is correct 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.160
 everything and as it just said it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.770
 complete my day i go with this 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.450
 anime 85 and as always, of course 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.920
 Everything is said and remains mine 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.270
 opinion if I do not like it then 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.500
 He just makes his own us 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.770
 see us next time expresses the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.770
 blood
