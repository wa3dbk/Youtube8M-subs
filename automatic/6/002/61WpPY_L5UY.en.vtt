00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.339
 second account 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.339
 see I just opened my pack of 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.989
 more than 70 send speed stacks 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.910
 change the others I will resell it 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.860
 quickly why did not we know you 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.390
 maybe not a player or two 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.700
 will resell so I'll start with 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.810
 250 credit with something of the kind in 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.590
 quickly reselling all my players 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.390
 etc and we will try to start everything 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.560
 right away so not the purpose of this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840
 series that's how I told you this is 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.460
 to go to make the purchase 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.590
 resale up to recovered lionel messi 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.930
 is not it going to be simple because 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.000
 lionel messi still costs 1.3 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.200
 million I start with 200 credit 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.729
 I hope you would follow me and 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040
 I hope it will help without help 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.439
 some to do some resale buying 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.689
 so listen to the voice yesterday I'm reselling 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.990
 my team bronze doors are that 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.399
 is useless here I continue to 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 resell there were some players that 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.810
 that I set aside and with the credits 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.039
 that I have I will start doing a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.600
 little bit of resale purchase so I 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.090
 will go and get money players 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.409
 but the technique the best technique 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.179
 as you go to a little bit later 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.499
 in the episode is to make 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.710
 search there see I'm looking for 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.170
 players play in 4 3 3 and I add 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.630
 some to my priority list 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.619
 I will finally end up falling out 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.359
 a Dutchman here it is ebecilio 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.469
 this is a four-star gesture 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.899
 technique I'm going to end up cowardice to 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.880
 200 credit would put it on sale for 400 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.350
 credit and we'll see if I can win 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.659
 some credits here and there 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.590
 so then as soon as I sell it 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.409
 end as soon as I would have sold some 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.289
 players I decided to base myself on 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.819
 on on the devices the cards 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.909
 device 4 3 2 1 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.710
 and so it's trying to catch them 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.069
 a maximum of 300 credit by reselling them 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.480
 800 miles and finally between 800 and 1000 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.819
 credits so this is the resale purchase 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 fast efficient and you will see that I 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 I still won a lot of credit 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 for this first episode so there traveling 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 started buying this money player there 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.970
 ebecilio wash weary players 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.440
 that I currently have in the pile of 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.790
 exchange 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.519
 I had bought a small dissonant grain 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.769
 bronze players at 200 credit I managed 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.780
 to resell it 1,757 it's already not bad 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.549
 I'm starting, so I say, well, that's good 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 g8 without credit it's time to make a 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.540
 little bit of buying resale on 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.739
 devices so I try people 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.230
 see small offers a little by here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.930
 hoping that it works 3 5 2 4 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.819
 4 5 1 here you see it does not work 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.549
 necessarily 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.900
 well here is 3-5-2 I decide to add 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.209
 here is to make offers up 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.069
 maximum 300 credits hoping that it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.870
 walk for the see the judge decides to 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.519
 to drop I have one to get to 3 5 2 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.970
 200 credit his 800 credit to win 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.340
 easily 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.590
 so here I continue to make 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.760
 offers here and there and that's what he 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.269
 do not hesitate to do some 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.680
 deals 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.540
 with a little luck the guys do not 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.269
 will not see this map is watching 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.780
 here I am still recovering a 4-3-1-2 to 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.000
 200 credit is not bad 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.000
 here are some credits here and there at 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.880
 come I resell it for for a 950 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.359
 I think that's it and then look for 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.049
 Bronze players two end england 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.000
 of npower 102 npower league 2 in 82 because 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.859
 that there are who can his good and has 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.530
 that's where I was 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.880
 fell on grandson and washed later I 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 will fall on a good little player you 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.440
 go see even if there was no 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.970
 contract it's about high already here it is 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.959
 it costs a little more and costs 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.269
 about 500 credits 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.380
 so I tried to get it back to you 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.639
 send in 82 he's 75 years old speed 75 in 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.260
 head so do not hesitate 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.750
 take players who have notes 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.159
 correct and 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.379
 see my currency stack 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.400
 so there still travel a lot of 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.659
 players always eat the old 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.370
 default players that finally I 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.269
 will eventually resell quickly for 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.430
 earn some credits 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.220
 because they will not have been sold the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
 vowel I sold the 3 5 2 after 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.980
 revive a the cards a device 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.209
 so she is selling maybe not all of 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.470
 next but you raise for one hour 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.449
 but maybe it's a little bit 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.829
 price here I put at 800 not for sure 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.380
 that he will go to the already said I did 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.419
 the same I put at 550 it will end up 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.010
 go 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.570
 and here we go, I think that after I 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.669
 not really need to comment on you I 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.889
 recovers a lot of cards device 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.270
 with the sales I made and that 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.979
 it was credit quickly won that I 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.650
 him for 300 salt if I had him I 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:45.260
 sell at 856 seems to me to 800 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.130
 then there I get a 3/4 a 4-3-1-2 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.260
 the best is to recover 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.419
 devices to four defenders or the 3 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.449
 May 2 here that's the simplest 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.010
 more effective after 5 2 2 1 and all that 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.389
 if you want to recover 150 voices you 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070
 can win 50 credits on it so 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.360
 it's not really profitable the most 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.490
 important here you see that still a 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.039
 4-3-1-2 that I get back to 250 clearly 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.550
 of friends his credit cd easily win 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.349
 really easily won and a 4-5-1 to 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.470
 150 credit is really fun 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.010
 so that's 700 credit win 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.500
 easily 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.970
 so we must not hesitate we must not 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.150
 hesitate to send you offers 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.240
 like that 150-200 it will not work often 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.490
 but it will work like 3 4 times by 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.150
 attempt is ultimately would end up 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.190
 earn money 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.470
 currently you will see you see there 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.940
 the players that I have there is way to have 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.080
 still makes a lot of money for 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.479
 this first episode knowing that I 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.460
 started at 200 credit is not bad 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.780
 it's not bad I was rather happy ah 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.870
 yes it's the default players and 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.760
 finally hop there the players got 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.080
 sold I jemma I resold 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.070
 quickly the other players the 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.680
 chosen formulas and here I am at 4830 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.110
 credit a gain of 4500 credit every 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.639
 players sold or sprung 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.080
 finally frozen sold that at 300 credit 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.570
 but hey that's already won 1,100 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.240
 credits must not be reluctant so 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.919
 here I still won 4573 credit 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.780
 for this first episode it's 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.710
 frankly not bad so I hope that 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.960
