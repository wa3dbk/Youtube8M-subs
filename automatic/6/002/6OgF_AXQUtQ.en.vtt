 as I always said if anyone 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.540
 remember some videos uploaded to

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.000
 a videotutorial is where I want 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.650
 teach them how although many should already 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.820
 Knowing should be simple it's easy but 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.890
 many people do not know it so good 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.050
 I'm going to show you how to install the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 drivers of a brother company 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.530
 and how to connect it as a contract like 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.530
 to use it and 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.690
 this is simple this is fast so 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.070
 so you like it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 started with aridity 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.420
 this 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.379
 good first to know is to insert the sil 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.120
 and that comes with a printer 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.810
 it's a pain hl company 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.780
 neil 112 is a black white printer 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.750
 It is quite as valid to print 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.740
 the things of a cubicle 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.740
 that thing 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 so good to place the cid and in 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.899
 the on the side or a part of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.750
 civil fence your computer surprise me 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.869
 I have some people de novo that is with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.450
 it's portable so it goes to the side of the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.369
 table with the split reading that you have 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.840
 a shirt are going to expect to be 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 exit in files or files 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 with files you will leave here below here 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.920
 will you say unit must divide 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.880
 unit of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.649
 brother is going to leave that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 this we are going to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.270
 let's do 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 and there 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.530
 but we are not going to criticize them 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 let's hope that not now for everything 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.610
 the files that has everything that has 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.160
 let's go to where it says be double 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.160
 click or right click the same 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.910
 right as I think now the window 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 good to put an execute like 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:46.290
 administrator or directly the writer 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.220
 up to the problem of double click 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.770
 so 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.570
 I think that now la la la 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.570
 but now the mental 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.800
 good opened the window the window 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.780
 this is I had to think a little bit about 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.150
 video because it gets slow as I'm 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.030
 recording the window through the window and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.569
 open where 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.569
 is 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.469
 you are going to choose here you can choose 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.840
 good chose the first language 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.280
 I am going to choose language because he spoke to you 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.859
 in Spanish or Spanish 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.530
 you mean they are French Brazilians 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.850
 really 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.459
 the language that you correspond Spanish 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.500
 and here it will come out again as a barrier 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.090
 mentally and install the driver 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.890
 laser printer and user guide 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.740
 custom installation support 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.200
 technical of the brother and record in 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.720
 line the only thing that is easy and simple 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.080
 is to come here directly to paint it at 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.120
 printer driver 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.410
 let's go for the printer driver 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.410
 who are going to click there 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.160
 this is going to leave a window where 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.110
 is going to install well I will pass it a 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.590
 just the video so be fast service 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.350

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.250
 choose the type of installation that 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.490
 we want we want you standard by 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.220
 Customized I recommend you standard 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.200
 the program is going to install the problem 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.780
 common is recommended for console 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.030
 user in region start with this the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.540
 customized but it is analyzed others 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.510
 this one more selective of selecting the 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.370
 options that you want to install already 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.680
