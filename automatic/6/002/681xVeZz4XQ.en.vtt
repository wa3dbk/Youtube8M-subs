00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.060
 hey people from spooky 1611 my numbers 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.560
 and happened today for you and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.929
 3003 gameplay 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.670
 namely rushdie filling on trial or 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 oman from natural back to carcass 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 super fat down why content was that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 for battlefield 3 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.990
 just like cabbage scores arms throat of it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.010
 a little less and after next because I'm super 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 Fat 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.010
 I promised you that I have to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 fittest among the game play would be is 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.189
 leper failed because I was this week 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.869
 barely had time to play games 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 so you have avoided them well 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 best oil gameplay scavenger 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.940
 mats 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.210
 that there are three that will just arrive 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.610
 namely means for designed fire 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.129
 I was busy last time too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.820
 that the multiplayer is plagued by 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.160
 boxing and they have finally announced 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.739
 until their pets finally come 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.899
 two months two months after that game 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.460
 off is going to come a patch the game 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.670
 breaking bath is going to dissolve 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.969
 it's like a holy grail i know 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 not finally and I just refuse 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.150
 to play the game until that patch out 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 is because it just drives me crazy like 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 I start a game they are in game and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.820
 I just can't change anything because Melis 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.520
 growth 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 yes freezes then I will just always fire 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 I will start to heaven 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 it will be that is just super annoying 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.290
 if you just want to play nicely from one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 in that simply is not possible 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.330
 so is actually only going to have that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 she who is going to come out with at the same time 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.420
 the new language on content third actor 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 that or the hand map pack has two names 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 yes what the map i am content i'm going now 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.610
 not so very much about it not falling 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.590
 check 2 million mouse for the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.299
 produce multiplayer to beat you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.030
 ask bin load together 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.040
 very nice and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.780
 just two new mouse costs ten 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.479
 or behind microsoft points and for 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.119
 limited edition use is free 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.540
 way all that patch there now want mainly 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.009
 I just go live myself briefly 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.960
 which they have placed on the log 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.880
 so they just go on fate itself 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.490
 see what is going to be fixed 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.690
 but the things go quite a lot 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.259
 being fixed and I am very sorry 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.619
 happy with 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 that first is hi- tim test samples 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.430
 Ai Pi Voiceover and that simply means 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.950
 that she finally 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.280
 speech cycling because first you come 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.989
 always say to iphone or you one 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 certain clogs to talk or 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.470
 that your mike was constantly about that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.690
 didn't work for one 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.569
 back so you always hear no matter what 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.840
 so you set that is finally fixed 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.489
 second thing is that they say yes or throne 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 you on the lower arts stems 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.440
 Dutch front on the visual 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.420
 appearance in multiplayer and I have 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.170
 frankly no idea of that 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.700
 grinds they go the yes how it looks 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.250
 they improve and multiplayer for 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.260
 what the user sees i have no take 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.660
 That would mean that they are high the precious 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.320
 cream multiplayer stopped and I have none 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.180
 silly idea 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.200
 so we'll see that as that patch 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.209
 she is finally going to the party 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.829
 solve problems so if you go with the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.620
 play gatjes then you probably go 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.299
 no longer be split into two teams 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.920
 the street the one with the one team 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.019
 and the other with the other team 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 so aim against each other ends that is 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.560
 just pussy 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.180
 if you are going to play with separate then he wants 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.010
 just stay together and you want it 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 I am not played in the whole village 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.280
 know that many three ted the same 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 had problems was also solved by 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.600
 patch and your actually also in medal or 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.829
 honor warfighter 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.299
 I'm not going to just tell everything to 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.130
 the important things i have not super 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.290
 long 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 they only function functions for the computer 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.329
 so now you can finally add your 4 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.640
 reviews 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.079
 adjust how wide you can look 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.180
 you do not quite setting 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.950
 school whether you will fit that number 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.680
 you just can not be a super chill 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.630
 so and they are also going to give a slider for that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.420
 jamaal speed if you sit in abs yourself 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.220
 a zoomed in during how to adjust yourself 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.170
 fast you can point as your way buzz 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.920
 So you have a little more control over it 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.200
 yes yes playing method 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.780
 for the rest , they are going for stability 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.220
 both the single player and the air play 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.020
 improve sharla whatsapp but they go 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.180
 thus improve stability and together 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.860
 with that they also have a few bucks and 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.140
 improve exploits 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.450
 whether you like fixer and that was about time too 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.970
 because I hear quite a few stories from it 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.220
 people so that the game suddenly crashed 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.350
 both on the playstation and xbox as 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.420
 computer or one that feels that problems 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.250
 my screen suddenly fries and then can 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.350
 I did not change anything from I left 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.090
 just immediately there all the things they have 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.980
 probably adjusted or to 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.840
 adjusted says the adjusted 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.150
 It is natural for fiction so that they 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.690
 also very nice that that finally 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.940
 forget going to be coming to rest 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.770
 another 10 multi per hour brings me I have 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.620
 no idea why she can do that afterwards 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.250
 do you have exhaust scamander bronze 123 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.870
 redemption months silver 1 2 3 decreased 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.000
 Atlas easily rolls one two three one 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.860
 Atlas Supreme Commander 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.140
 no idea where to add it afterwards 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.240
 But yes the more you bring 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.930
 of course government and 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.190
 go quick select for glasses and water 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.110
 add 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.670
 and that's probably just one 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.530
 kind of kind of pussy is that you just 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.750
 fast water can select its claessens 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.330
 that you are completely cumbersome 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.810
 via that extremely well-designed user 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.810
 interface 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.180
 that you are the smallest water board 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.830
 select so that is also awful 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.520
 great that they finally adjusted 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:33.960
 So yes have this kind of knows hove 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.610
 it in the patch that is going to be 17 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.380
 December before Peter December 18 before 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.570
 xbox 360 users and place is with that 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.700
 use your north america and december 19th 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.300
 for PCs and those users in Europe 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.520
 but yes yes that patch it was time 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.560
 I already say 10 million times too 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.420
 a previous video 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.760
 if you release a game it doesn't 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.310
 stable and tens of thousands of buks 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.710
 knows that game that dies as one 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.900
 malle and that has now been the case 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.320
 because yes a multiplayer count 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.270
 just 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.550
 really gone down considerably lately 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.020
 its just little full service though 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.830
 level you buy nice to leave green 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.060
 thumb behind 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.800
 If you have the feedback, I will see you 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.800
 next time guests later
