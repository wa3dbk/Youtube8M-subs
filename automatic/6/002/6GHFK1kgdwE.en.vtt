the saltwater hobby or corals or

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.469 
the saltwater hobby or corals or
specifically<00:01:19.190> SPS<00:01:20.190> corals<00:01:21.080> they<00:01:22.080> need

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
specifically SPS corals they need

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
specifically SPS corals they need
top-notch<00:01:24.479> lighting<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.380> super-strong

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
top-notch lighting of super-strong

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
top-notch lighting of super-strong
lighting<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:27.150> great<00:01:27.450> water<00:01:27.690> flow<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
lighting really great water flow it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
lighting really great water flow it's
usually<00:01:28.260> medium<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:29.130> strong<00:01:29.400> water<00:01:29.729> flow<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
usually medium to strong water flow and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.950 
usually medium to strong water flow and
there<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.400> water<00:01:32.640> parameters<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there the water parameters have to be on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
there the water parameters have to be on
point<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.830> need<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.760> great<00:01:36.000> water

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
point so you need really great water

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
point so you need really great water
quality<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.409> successfully<00:01:38.130> grow<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.490> out

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
quality to successfully grow these out

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.719 
quality to successfully grow these out
so<00:01:39.320> I'm<00:01:40.320> testing<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.040> seeing<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.610> my

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so I'm testing it out seeing how my

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.230 
so I'm testing it out seeing how my
Corolla<00:01:41.970> does<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.510> my<00:01:43.320> tank<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.850> far<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
Corolla does in my tank I'm so so far so

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.940 
Corolla does in my tank I'm so so far so
good

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
good

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.140 
good
lastly<00:01:46.950> let<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.400> know<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.760> guys<00:01:47.850> think

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
lastly let me know what you guys think

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.850 
lastly let me know what you guys think
about<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> guys<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
about this do you guys like it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.219 
about this do you guys like it
if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.460> guys<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.210> should<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:52.080> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
if you guys think I should get more of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
if you guys think I should get more of
these<00:01:52.369> like<00:01:53.369> different<00:01:53.790> SPS<00:01:54.180> corals<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.810> grow

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
these like different SPS corals and grow

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.310 
these like different SPS corals and grow
them<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.880> eventually<00:01:56.880> frag<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.659> let<00:01:58.290> me

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
them out and eventually frag them let me

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.040 
them out and eventually frag them let me
know<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.830> obviously<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.280> takes<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.790> so

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
know but obviously that takes time so

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.770 
know but obviously that takes time so
because<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:01.980> two<00:02:02.310> inches<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:03.690> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because this is about two inches so it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
because this is about two inches so it
takes<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:04.650> growl<00:02:04.920> grow<00:02:05.610> out

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
takes some time for it to growl grow out

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.010 
takes some time for it to growl grow out
