bottom<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> more<00:02:24.630> top<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.230> less<00:02:25.470> mids

bottom and more top and less mids

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.980 
bottom and more top and less mids
probably<00:02:27.360> something<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.690> wouldn't<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:27.959> a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
probably something that wouldn't be a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.360 
probably something that wouldn't be a
bad<00:02:28.050> thing<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.530> help<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.770> thing<00:02:28.830> cut<00:02:29.190> through

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
bad thing to help this thing cut through

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.010 
bad thing to help this thing cut through
the<00:02:29.459> mix<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> great<00:02:30.630> sounding

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
the mix but it's a great sounding

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.960

recording<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.560> start<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:31.980> let's<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:32.880> what

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
recording to start with let's see what

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
recording to start with let's see what
we<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.540> start<00:02:34.319> with<00:02:34.410> some<00:02:34.560> pretty

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
we can do so start with some pretty

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.800 
we can do so start with some pretty
moderate<00:02:35.430> settings<00:02:35.910> which<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.209> typically

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
moderate settings which you typically

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.540 
moderate settings which you typically
want<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> good<00:02:38.190> sounding

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
want to do with a good sounding

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.580 
want to do with a good sounding
recording<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> beginning<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> then

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
recording from the beginning and then

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.070 
recording from the beginning and then
I'll<00:02:40.709> kind<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.950> dial<00:02:41.250> them<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.489> more

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
I'll kind of dial them in more

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
I'll kind of dial them in more
aggressive<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.620> hear<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.310> way

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
aggressive just so you can hear the way

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.100 
aggressive just so you can hear the way
the<00:02:44.550> EQ<00:02:44.910> works<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> here's<00:02:45.870> some<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.019> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the EQ works and here's some of the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
the EQ works and here's some of the
tonal<00:02:46.380> possibilities<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.459> let<00:02:47.550> me<00:02:47.640> kick<00:02:47.820> this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
tonal possibilities so let me kick this

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:47.160 
tonal possibilities so let me kick this
thing<00:02:48.180> off

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.330 

you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.290> see<00:03:48.410> how<00:03:48.500> subtle<00:03:48.769> this<00:03:49.010> thing<00:03:49.220> is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
you can see how subtle this thing is

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.410 
you can see how subtle this thing is
almost<00:03:49.550> like<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.940> kind<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.180> subtle

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
almost like the kind of subtle

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.119 
almost like the kind of subtle
colorations<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:50.989> get<00:03:51.230> from<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.620> different

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
colorations you get from a different

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.280 
colorations you get from a different
preamp<00:03:52.730> choice<00:03:53.000> all<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.660> way<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:53.989> pretty

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
preamp choice all the way to some pretty

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.500 
preamp choice all the way to some pretty
wild<00:03:54.680> departures<00:03:55.489> from<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.790> original<00:03:56.150> sounds

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
wild departures from the original sounds

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.790 
wild departures from the original sounds
and<00:03:56.599> original<00:03:56.870> recordings<00:03:57.260> were<00:03:57.410> getting<00:03:57.680> but

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
and original recordings were getting but

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.920 
and original recordings were getting but
you<00:03:58.459> never<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.360> know<00:03:59.480> where<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.750> want

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
you never know you know where you want

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.620 
you never know you know where you want
to<00:04:00.019> take<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> sound<00:04:01.090> oftentimes<00:04:02.090> on<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.300> way<00:04:02.420> in

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
to take a sound oftentimes on the way in

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.449 
to take a sound oftentimes on the way in
and<00:04:02.840> that's<00:04:03.380> what<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> great<00:04:03.739> EQ<00:04:04.160> like<00:04:04.280> this

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
and that's what a great EQ like this

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.220 
and that's what a great EQ like this
could<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.880> for<00:04:05.239> when<00:04:05.690> you're<00:04:05.810> trying<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.019> put

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
could be for when you're trying to put

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.370 
could be for when you're trying to put
that<00:04:06.349> piano<00:04:06.590> through<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.890> mix<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:09.200> last

thing I'd like to the last thing I'd
like<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.790> exhibit<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.299> kind<00:04:11.660> of<00:04:11.690> how<00:04:11.810> it

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
like to exhibit is kind of how it

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.440 
like to exhibit is kind of how it
handles<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.349> full<00:04:13.280> kind<00:04:13.549> of<00:04:13.640> Ensemble<00:04:14.269> on

handles a full kind of Ensemble on
location<00:04:15.049> classical<00:04:15.650> sounds<00:04:15.980> this<00:04:16.310> could<00:04:16.549> be

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
location classical sounds this could be

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.180 
location classical sounds this could be
either<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.320> post-processing<00:04:18.320> after<00:04:18.919> we<00:04:19.040> took

either a post-processing after we took

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.250

the tracks back from the hall or it

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.659

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
neutral sounding preamp and then

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.310 
neutral sounding preamp and then
doctorate<00:04:32.419> with<00:04:32.540> just<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.810> little<00:04:33.110> bit<00:04:33.229> of

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
doctorate with just a little bit of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.650 
doctorate with just a little bit of
subtle<00:04:33.650> EQ<00:04:34.100> work<00:04:34.280> there's<00:04:35.240> absolutely

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
subtle EQ work there's absolutely

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480 
subtle EQ work there's absolutely
nothing<00:04:35.870> wrong<00:04:36.050> with<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.500> neither<00:04:37.250> is

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
nothing wrong with that neither is

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
nothing wrong with that neither is
taking<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.850> home<00:04:37.940> if<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.180> don't<00:04:38.270> want<00:04:38.450> to

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
taking it home if you don't want to

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.820 
taking it home if you don't want to
print<00:04:38.660> those<00:04:38.840> tracks<00:04:39.200> so<00:04:39.380> you're<00:04:39.530> in<00:04:39.590> front<00:04:39.770> of

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
print those tracks so you're in front of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.310 
print those tracks so you're in front of
your<00:04:39.889> trustworthy<00:04:40.610> speakers<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:42.290> know

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
your trustworthy speakers you know

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.659 
your trustworthy speakers you know
that's<00:04:42.530> another<00:04:42.740> approach<00:04:42.889> as<00:04:43.220> well<00:04:43.340> let's

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
that's another approach as well let's

00:04:43.669 --> 00:05:04.580 
that's another approach as well let's
let's<00:04:44.240> take<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.419> listen<00:04:44.540> what<00:04:44.720> we've<00:04:44.840> got

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.560 

so<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.620> think<00:05:05.710> generally<00:05:06.160> speaking<00:05:06.570> another

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
so I think generally speaking another

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.000 
so I think generally speaking another
nice<00:05:07.780> sounding<00:05:08.140> recording<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:08.710> one<00:05:08.860> was

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
nice sounding recording this one was

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.940 
nice sounding recording this one was

the low mids all right going back in
there<00:05:36.270> I'm<00:05:37.270> gonna<00:05:37.420> cut<00:05:37.630> some<00:05:37.660> low<00:05:37.960> mids<00:05:38.170> at<00:05:38.320> 300

there I'm gonna cut some low mids at 300
I'm<00:05:38.920> going<00:05:39.070> to<00:05:39.130> boost<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.490> little<00:05:39.520> bit<00:05:39.820> of

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
I'm going to boost a little bit of

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.610 
I'm going to boost a little bit of
brightness<00:05:40.060> at<00:05:40.390> one<00:05:40.630> point<00:05:40.810> 2k<00:05:41.320> which<00:05:41.470> would

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
brightness at one point 2k which would

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.320 
brightness at one point 2k which would
bring<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.800> little<00:05:41.920> edge<00:05:42.130> out<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.700> sax<00:05:43.060> and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
bring a little edge out on that sax and

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.770 
bring a little edge out on that sax and
I'm<00:05:43.600> gonna<00:05:43.690> add<00:05:43.840> some<00:05:44.200> air<00:05:44.410> at<00:05:44.560> 10k<00:05:44.880> I<00:05:45.880> think<00:05:46.300> I

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
I'm gonna add some air at 10k I think I

00:05:46.780 --> 00:06:35.040 
I'm gonna add some air at 10k I think I
think<00:05:47.560> you'll<00:05:47.650> like<00:05:47.830> what<00:05:47.980> you<00:05:48.010> hear

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.790 

Wow<00:06:36.050> well<00:06:36.550> not<00:06:37.550> quite<00:06:37.759> a<00:06:37.789> corrective<00:06:38.389> EQ<00:06:39.319> in<00:06:39.619> a

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
Wow well not quite a corrective EQ in a

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.739 
Wow well not quite a corrective EQ in a
way<00:06:39.979> but<00:06:40.039> it<00:06:41.029> took<00:06:41.149> what<00:06:41.360> I<00:06:41.419> thought<00:06:41.599> was<00:06:41.719> a

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:41.749 
way but it took what I thought was a

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:43.510 
way but it took what I thought was a
good<00:06:41.930> sign<00:06:42.110> of<00:06:42.139> recording<00:06:42.619> and<00:06:42.770> really<00:06:43.219> opened

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
good sign of recording and really opened

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.879 
good sign of recording and really opened
it<00:06:43.580> up<00:06:43.699> brought<00:06:43.939> out<00:06:44.089> the<00:06:44.210> top<00:06:44.419> end<00:06:44.889> clarified

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
it up brought out the top end clarified

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.980 
it up brought out the top end clarified
the<00:06:46.099> low<00:06:46.249> end<00:06:46.539> eliminated<00:06:47.539> some<00:06:47.629> of<00:06:47.689> the<00:06:47.809> hall

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
the low end eliminated some of the hall

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.649 
the low end eliminated some of the hall
muddiness<00:06:48.349> I<00:06:48.740> found<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:49.669> this<00:06:49.969> hammer<00:06:50.330> can

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
muddiness I found that this hammer can

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.450 
muddiness I found that this hammer can
process<00:06:51.529> audio<00:06:51.889> in<00:06:52.369> ways<00:06:52.610> that<00:06:53.139> I<00:06:54.309> thought<00:06:55.309> was

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
process audio in ways that I thought was

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.339 
process audio in ways that I thought was
a<00:06:55.490> great<00:06:55.669> sound<00:06:55.969> recording<00:06:56.509> and<00:06:56.659> make<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.229> even

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
a great sound recording and make it even

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.409 
a great sound recording and make it even
better<00:06:57.469> so<00:06:57.919> it's<00:06:58.699> really<00:06:58.909> a<00:06:58.999> tool<00:06:59.210> whether

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
better so it's really a tool whether

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.510
