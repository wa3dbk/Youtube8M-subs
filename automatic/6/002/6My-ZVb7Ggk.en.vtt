00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
what I love about photography is the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.980 
what I love about photography is the
ability<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.460> capture<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.180> particular<00:00:06.540> moment

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
ability to capture a particular moment

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.200 
ability to capture a particular moment
in<00:00:07.259> time<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.460> nature<00:00:08.639> particularly

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
in time you know in nature particularly

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.820 
in time you know in nature particularly
since<00:00:09.570> I'm<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> landscape<00:00:10.139> photographer<00:00:10.260> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
since I'm a landscape photographer and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.669 
since I'm a landscape photographer and
the<00:00:11.519> thing<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.880> nature<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.290> landscape

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the thing about nature and the landscape

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.760 
the thing about nature and the landscape
is<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.950> moments<00:00:14.490> are<00:00:14.580> very<00:00:14.610> fleeting<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
is that moments are very fleeting and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
is that moments are very fleeting and
what<00:00:16.770> most<00:00:16.980> people<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:17.550> really<00:00:17.760> tend<00:00:18.690> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
what most people don't really tend to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
what most people don't really tend to
look<00:00:18.840> around<00:00:19.080> them<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:19.770> they're<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
look around them when they're out and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.880 
look around them when they're out and
about<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.880> world<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.680> being<00:00:22.680> able<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
about in the world and being able to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
about in the world and being able to
capture<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.310> particular<00:00:23.490> moment<00:00:24.029> particularly

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
capture a particular moment particularly

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.160 
capture a particular moment particularly
stunning<00:00:25.019> moment<00:00:25.470> allows<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.960> show<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
stunning moment allows you to show that

to capture that particular scene where

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.799 
to capture that particular scene where
people<00:00:38.010> maybe<00:00:38.700> didn't<00:00:39.149> even<00:00:39.210> notice<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> the
