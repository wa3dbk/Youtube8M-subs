as you can see I got the who Chen first
one<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.689> usually<00:01:54.899> tell<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.680> fish

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
one way you can usually tell which fish

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310 
one way you can usually tell which fish
you<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.729> line<00:01:56.969> between<00:01:57.899> these<00:01:58.079> two

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

is<00:01:58.590> by<00:01:59.340> how<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.939> fights<00:02:00.680> usually<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.450> red

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is by how much it fights usually the red

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
is by how much it fights usually the red
horse<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.950> fight

while the who Chen will put up quite a
bit<00:02:08.759> which<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.720> saw<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> got<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
word here a little bit as it gets kind

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.740

of slow here as you can see the fish

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.720 
of slow here as you can see the fish
that<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.930> got<00:02:19.110> online<00:02:19.470> right<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:19.730> was

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that I got online right here was

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.850 
that I got online right here was
fighting<00:02:21.540> quite<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> bit<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.200> go<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.830> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
fighting quite a bit so I go it so I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.020 
fighting quite a bit so I go it so I
went<00:02:23.100> ahead<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.430> let<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> go

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
went ahead and let it go

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.760 
went ahead and let it go
since<00:02:24.270> I'm<00:02:24.750> guessing<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.350> probably

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
since I'm guessing it was probably

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.280 
since I'm guessing it was probably
another<00:02:26.040> who<00:02:26.730> Chen<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.600> you're<00:02:27.780> wondering<00:02:28.170> why

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
another who Chen if you're wondering why

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.840 
another who Chen if you're wondering why
I've<00:02:28.500> only<00:02:28.710> been<00:02:28.920> talking<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.460> these<00:02:29.580> two

I've only been talking about these two
fish<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.390> far<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:31.290> because<00:02:31.710> they're<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
fish so far it's because they're the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.220 
fish so far it's because they're the
only<00:02:32.130> two<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.940> being<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.810> caught<00:02:34.020> with

finally decided on using a green lower

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.300 
finally decided on using a green lower
over<00:02:54.510> here<00:02:54.690> by<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> waterfall<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:56.190> was

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
over here by the waterfall as I was

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.920 
over here by the waterfall as I was
going<00:02:56.460> after<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> roach<00:02:57.240> which<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
going after the roach which is the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.490 
going after the roach which is the
second<00:02:58.410> fish<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> scrapbook<00:03:00.380> ended<00:03:01.380> up

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
second fish in the scrapbook ended up

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.740 
second fish in the scrapbook ended up
catching<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.950> green<00:03:02.190> sunfish<00:03:02.490> which<00:03:03.360> works<00:03:03.570> out

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
catching a green sunfish which works out

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.570 
catching a green sunfish which works out
because<00:03:03.960> it's<00:03:04.260> another<00:03:04.530> new<00:03:04.770> fish<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.340> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
because it's another new fish that I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.090 
because it's another new fish that I
haven't<00:03:06.270> gotten<00:03:06.600> I'm<00:03:07.260> going<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> keep<00:03:07.800> trying

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100

to go after the roach with green lures

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.380 
to go after the roach with green lures
the<00:03:10.830> problem<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.310> using<00:03:11.490> green<00:03:11.880> lures<00:03:12.120> is

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the problem with using green lures is

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.720 
the problem with using green lures is
there<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> ton<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.590> different<00:03:13.920> fish<00:03:14.460> that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
there are a ton of different fish that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.180 
there are a ton of different fish that
you<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:15.000> catch<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.570> believe<00:03:16.320> there<00:03:16.500> are<00:03:16.650> ten<00:03:17.010> or

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
you can catch I believe there are ten or

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.630 
you can catch I believe there are ten or
so

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.020 
so
and<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.900> see<00:03:19.459> again<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.640> didn't<00:03:20.880> catch

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and as you can see again we didn't catch

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
and as you can see again we didn't catch
the<00:03:21.270> roach<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.080> caught<00:03:22.260> another<00:03:22.590> green

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the roach but caught another green

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
sunfish I'm going to speed up the video

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.840
