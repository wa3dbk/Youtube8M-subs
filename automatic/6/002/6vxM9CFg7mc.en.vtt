just<00:00:22.560> about<00:00:22.680> everybody<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.130> think<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.340> but

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
just about everybody can think of but

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.380 
just about everybody can think of but
I've<00:00:23.519> never<00:00:23.699> read<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.840> solo<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> his<00:00:26.400> never<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
figured why not its number one let's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.450 
figured why not its number one let's
jump<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.820> starts<00:00:31.040> sort<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.340> would

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
jump on it starts sort of like you would

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.069 
jump on it starts sort of like you would
expect<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.300> thinking<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> know

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
expect that I'm thinking because I know

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
expect that I'm thinking because I know
as<00:00:34.260> origin<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.649> thinking<00:00:34.860> origin<00:00:35.219> story<00:00:35.430> cool

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

as origin I'm thinking origin story cool
but<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.840> goes<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.969> who

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
