been<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.250> longer<00:00:08.309> than<00:00:08.700> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
been going on a lot longer than I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.180 
been going on a lot longer than I
expected<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.719> figured<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.769> best<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
expected it to I figured it best to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.160 
expected it to I figured it best to
update<00:00:11.639> everyone<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.179> exactly<00:00:12.780> what<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.110> going

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
update everyone on exactly what is going

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.799 
update everyone on exactly what is going
on<00:00:13.559> now<00:00:14.309> back<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.820> April<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> began<00:00:15.599> having

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
on now back in April I began having

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.510 
on now back in April I began having
problems<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.379> left<00:00:16.619> analog<00:00:16.859> stick<00:00:17.070> on

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
problems with the left analog stick on

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.510 
problems with the left analog stick on
my<00:00:17.910> ps3<00:00:18.270> controller<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:19.680> every<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.250> often

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
my ps3 controller how every so often

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
my ps3 controller how every so often
after<00:00:20.910> continued<00:00:21.630> use<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.900> pressing<00:00:22.439> forward

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
after continued use of pressing forward

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.349 
after continued use of pressing forward
it<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.100> get<00:00:23.250> off<00:00:23.430> centered<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.210> would

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it would get off centered and I would

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
it would get off centered and I would
occasionally<00:00:24.779> creep<00:00:25.320> forward<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.849> became

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
occasionally creep forward which became

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
occasionally creep forward which became
a<00:00:27.240> major<00:00:27.510> issue<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.230> smaller<00:00:28.710> platforms<00:00:29.400> where

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
a major issue on smaller platforms where

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.060 
a major issue on smaller platforms where
you<00:00:29.699> would<00:00:29.820> end<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.330> walking<00:00:30.960> off<00:00:31.140> not

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you would end up just walking off not

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
you would end up just walking off not
really<00:00:32.340> something<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.730> want<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> platformers

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
really something you want in platformers

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
really something you want in platformers
which<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.590> lot<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.309> even<00:00:36.149> made<00:00:36.270> mention

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
which I do a lot of I even made mention

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.850 
which I do a lot of I even made mention
of<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.780> during<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.230> charity<00:00:37.710> marathon

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
of this during the charity marathon

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
of this during the charity marathon
later<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.579> month<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.600> eventually<00:00:40.050> i<00:00:40.140> took

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
later that month now eventually i took

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.720 
later that month now eventually i took
the<00:00:40.590> controller<00:00:40.950> part<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> i<00:00:41.430> began<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the controller part and i began to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
the controller part and i began to
fiddle<00:00:42.030> around<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.719> left<00:00:42.930> analog<00:00:43.050> stick

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
fiddle around with the left analog stick

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
fiddle around with the left analog stick
in<00:00:43.559> order<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> recenter<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in order to recenter it and that kind of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.100 
in order to recenter it and that kind of
worked<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> most<00:00:46.559> part<00:00:47.030> temporarily

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
worked for the most part temporarily

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
worked for the most part temporarily
then<00:00:49.110> earlier<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> month<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.039> problem<00:00:50.460> arose

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
then earlier this month a problem arose

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
then earlier this month a problem arose
again<00:00:51.360> even<00:00:51.750> worse<00:00:51.930> than<00:00:52.170> before<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.829> much<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
again even worse than before so much so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
again even worse than before so much so
that<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.460> wasn't<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.879> continued<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that it wasn't just continued use that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.010 
that it wasn't just continued use that
made<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> left<00:00:56.100> analog<00:00:56.250> stick<00:00:56.460> uncentered<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
made the left analog stick uncentered it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
made the left analog stick uncentered it
became<00:00:58.379> uncentered<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.370> time<00:00:59.609> were

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
became uncentered all the time were

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.770 
became uncentered all the time were
standing<00:01:00.449> still<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> nyam<00:01:01.859> possibility<00:01:02.780> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
standing still was a nyam possibility so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
standing still was a nyam possibility so
yet<00:01:03.960> again<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.229> took<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.530> upon<00:01:04.589> myself<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.250> take

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
yet again I took it upon myself to take

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
yet again I took it upon myself to take
the<00:01:05.640> controller<00:01:05.970> apart<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.479> hopes<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.810> maybe

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the controller apart in hopes that maybe

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
the controller apart in hopes that maybe
I<00:01:07.170> could<00:01:07.320> fix<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.040> second<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.520> by

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I could fix it for a second time by

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
I could fix it for a second time by
fiddling<00:01:09.090> around<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> left<00:01:09.960> analog

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
fiddling around with the left analog

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.890 
fiddling around with the left analog
stick<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.820> after<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> few<00:01:12.119> days<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.479> attempting

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
stick and after a few days of attempting

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
stick and after a few days of attempting
to<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.650> made<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.220> grave<00:01:14.640> mistake<00:01:14.689> by

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to do so I made a grave mistake by

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
to do so I made a grave mistake by
removing<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.259> piece<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> metal<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> left

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
removing the piece of metal in the left

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
removing the piece of metal in the left
analog<00:01:17.909> stick<00:01:18.500> thereby<00:01:19.500> destroying<00:01:19.770> all

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
analog stick thereby destroying all

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.719 
analog stick thereby destroying all
movement<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.060> together<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.130> no<00:01:23.340> remedy

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
movement all together so with no remedy

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
movement all together so with no remedy
in<00:01:23.880> sight<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.930> became<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.009> ps3

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
in sight this is what became of the ps3

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.230 
in sight this is what became of the ps3
controller<00:01:27.409> completely<00:01:28.409> gutted<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> had<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
controller completely gutted so I had to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760 
controller completely gutted so I had to
go<00:01:30.420> online<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> replacement

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
go online and get a replacement

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
go online and get a replacement
controller<00:01:32.310> however<00:01:32.610> seeing<00:01:32.909> us<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.299> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
last issue with this controller is that

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.020 
last issue with this controller is that
if<00:03:50.129> you<00:03:50.220> try<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.819> turn<00:03:51.120> off<00:03:51.560> your<00:03:52.560> ps3<00:03:52.949> while<00:03:53.790> it

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.150 

it<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.819> turning<00:04:05.060> itself<00:04:05.390> off<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:08.860> is<00:04:09.860> still

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
pressing any buttons give it a min to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:30.520 
pressing any buttons give it a min to
wait<00:04:25.840> maybe<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.930> little<00:04:27.050> bit<00:04:27.200> longer<00:04:29.440> only<00:04:30.440> how

that<00:04:30.680> actually<00:04:30.830> work<00:04:31.460> well<00:04:32.030> normally<00:04:32.270> the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
that actually work well normally the

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.150 
that actually work well normally the
past<00:04:32.810> few<00:04:32.960> times<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.320> I've<00:04:33.440> done<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:34.010> is

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
past few times and I've done that it is

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.370 
past few times and I've done that it is
automatically<00:04:34.700> turn<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.300> control<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.780> ps3

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
automatically turn the control the ps3

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.780 
automatically turn the control the ps3
back<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:38.979> wide<00:04:39.979> actually<00:04:40.370> want<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.669> work

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
back on wide actually want it to work

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.659 
back on wide actually want it to work
this<00:04:40.970> time<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.479> don't<00:04:41.870> know<00:04:42.080> but<00:04:42.470> normally<00:04:43.130> the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
this time I don't know but normally the

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.159 
this time I don't know but normally the
past<00:04:43.910> few<00:04:44.090> times<00:04:44.330> I've<00:04:44.510> done<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:44.990> is

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
past few times I've done it it is

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.000 
past few times I've done it it is
automatically<00:04:45.860> turn<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.400> console<00:04:46.880> back<00:04:47.120> on

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
automatically turn the console back on

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.070 
automatically turn the console back on
so<00:04:49.010> what<00:04:49.160> exactly<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:49.760> means<00:04:50.090> is<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.389> until

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
so what exactly this means is that until

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.800 
so what exactly this means is that until
I<00:04:51.110> can<00:04:51.440> get<00:04:51.620> another<00:04:52.280> replacement<00:04:52.940> ps3

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
I can get another replacement ps3

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.180 
I can get another replacement ps3

I know a lot of you are saying well why

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.010 
I know a lot of you are saying well why

broken ps3 controller I play all of my

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.070 
broken ps3 controller I play all of my

ps2 games on my backwards compatible ps3
so<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.500> still<00:05:09.800> need<00:05:09.979> a<00:05:10.010> ps3<00:05:10.340> controller<00:05:10.520> for

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
so I still need a ps3 controller for

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.840 
so I still need a ps3 controller for
those<00:05:11.360> games<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:12.710> more<00:05:12.919> than<00:05:12.950> likely<00:05:13.130> until
