00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.340 
little olive oil for I don't know reason
and<00:00:52.170> sprayed<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.430> inside<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and sprayed it all over the inside of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.490

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
both the cooking chamber as well as the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.810 
both the cooking chamber as well as the
firebox<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.399> well<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.379> cooking<00:01:01.379> grates

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
firebox as well as on the cooking grates

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.719 
firebox as well as on the cooking grates
and<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> may<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.040> able<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and so if you may be able to see that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
and so if you may be able to see that
but<00:01:05.939> anyway<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.990> covered<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.470> oil<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
but anyway it's covered with oil and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
but anyway it's covered with oil and
everything<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.670> basically<00:01:08.820> smoke

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
everything and that will basically smoke

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.609 
everything and that will basically smoke
and<00:01:09.600> create<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> barrier<00:01:10.200> season<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> metal

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and create a barrier season the metal

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
and create a barrier season the metal
what<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> mixture<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
what I have right here is a mixture of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.859 
what I have right here is a mixture of
lump<00:01:16.170> charcoal<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.570> actual<00:01:18.570> mesquite<00:01:19.229> wood

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
lump charcoal and actual mesquite wood

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.179 
lump charcoal and actual mesquite wood
so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> try<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.799> burns

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
so I want to try and see how that burns

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.870 
so I want to try and see how that burns
and<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.360> forth<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:26.119> soaked<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.600> lighter

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and so forth I put a soaked in lighter

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.800 
and so forth I put a soaked in lighter
and<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.290> essentially<00:01:32.100> ready<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> go<00:01:32.810> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and it is essentially ready to go so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.880 
and it is essentially ready to go so
we're<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> first<00:01:34.860> flame<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.340> here

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
we're gonna see the first flame up here

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.340 
we're gonna see the first flame up here
together<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.280> film<00:01:38.610> by<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.630> there's<00:01:40.200> my

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
together on film by the way there's my

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
together on film by the way there's my
olive<00:01:40.710> oil<00:01:40.890> which<00:01:41.070> I'll<00:01:41.250> set<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
olive oil which I'll set down for the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.490 
olive oil which I'll set down for the
moment<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:45.840> Texans<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
moment and I do have for all Texans a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.630 
moment and I do have for all Texans a
little<00:01:46.710> bit<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> shiner<00:01:47.100> blonde<00:01:47.689> to<00:01:48.689> help<00:01:49.640> make

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
little bit of shiner blonde to help make

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
little bit of shiner blonde to help make
the<00:01:50.759> process<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:51.210> along<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.049> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the process go along and I think it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
the process go along and I think it's
actually<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> law<00:01:52.710> somewhere<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> have

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
actually a law somewhere that you have

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
actually a law somewhere that you have
to<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.229> anyway<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.799> go<00:01:55.950> lose<00:01:56.070> the
