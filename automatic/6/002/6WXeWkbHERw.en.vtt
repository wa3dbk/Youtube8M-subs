 if they always learn to ride 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.810

 the sport ride closer under the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 Franz Wagner at his riding school 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.239
 there we brought a lot about the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.850
 everyday life and the tasks of horses the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.510
 are in daily training in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.510
 Experience

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.300
 the piece has to be a step once 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.370

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.380
 Run 20 to 30 minutes to go which is 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.770
 often that will enlighten the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.500
 is loose and through the 30 minutes there 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.540

 on the way also the postprocessing of the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.810
 Horses are of great importance as they are 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 otherwise exposed to unnecessary stress 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:02:01.360

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.290
