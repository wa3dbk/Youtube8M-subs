00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
a bell our boiling pot does not we're

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.740 
a bell our boiling pot does not we're
not<00:00:38.220> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.579> drain<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> boiling<00:00:39.540> pot

not going to drain from the boiling pot

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
not going to drain from the boiling pot
we're<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> siphon<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
we're going to siphon off of it and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.820 
we're going to siphon off of it and
leave<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.940> truth<00:00:42.269> behind<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:43.589> use

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
leave all the truth behind so we use

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.049 
leave all the truth behind so we use
this<00:00:44.070> setup<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.470> mostly<00:00:46.470> all<00:00:46.650> grain<00:00:47.059> we're

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this setup for mostly all grain we're

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.130 
this setup for mostly all grain we're
going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.620> our<00:00:49.620> water<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.220> our<00:00:50.339> string<00:00:51.140> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
going to our water and our string and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.479 
going to our water and our string and
we're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.769> get<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.220> temperature

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
we're going to get it to the temperature

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
we're going to get it to the temperature
that<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.820> need<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.629> drain<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.350> into

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that we need and then drain it off into

that we need and then drain it off into
our<00:00:55.890> mash<00:00:56.129> water<00:00:56.550> which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> where<00:00:57.600> our<00:00:57.629> grains

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
our mash water which is where our grains

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
our mash water which is where our grains
are<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.190> control<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> temperature<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
are we can control the temperature a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
are we can control the temperature a
couple<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> different<00:01:01.289> ways<00:01:04.100> drain<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> into

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
couple of different ways drain it into

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.870 
couple of different ways drain it into
our<00:01:06.060> mash<00:01:06.680> or<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.070> drink<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.490> cooler

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
our mash or we could drink some cooler
