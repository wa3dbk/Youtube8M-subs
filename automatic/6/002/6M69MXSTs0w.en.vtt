00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.010
 The digestive system has the function of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 process the food we eat 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 separate the different substances as 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 mineral carbohydrate proteins 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.450
 and fats from this separation arise 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.370
 nutrients that are delivered 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.950
 to the blood through the intestines 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.890
 to be transported to each point of the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.710
 organism 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.559
 the digestive tract begins in the mouth 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.630
 where you start to undo the food 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 with the help of saliva 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.310
 saliva is the first step to the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 digestion of carbohydrates 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.510
 the food is transported to the stomach 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 through the esophagus 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.210
 there is combined with hydrochloric acid 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.880
 which helps to undo the most when it has 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.890
 dissolved all the food the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.710
 fluid that remains is called lemon 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.629
 it passes to the intestine through the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.879
 pylorus so that in the segment of 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.780
 small intestine can be absorbed 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.090
 nutrients and move to the blood 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 the rest of the substances pass to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.860
 colon where the water is absorbed and from there 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.620
 to the rectum to be eliminated 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.300
 the process of absorption of nutrients 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.810
 performed in an area of â€‹â€‹the intestine 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.230
 thin 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.570
 there the nutrients pass to the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.660
 bloodstream to be distributed 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.970
 to the whole body this system of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.729
 absorption is complex and sensitive to 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.360
 substances by passing only some 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.030
 as vitamins minerals proteins 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.280
 etcetera in certain quantities other 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.070
 as the vegetable fibers are not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 absorbed only serve as vehicles and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.650
 of intestinal cleansing is important 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.500
 Good condition of the intestine to allow 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.350
 the greatest absorption of food since 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.600
 an excess of alcohol fat or lack of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.149
 fiber for example interfere with the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.520
 absorption process and nutrients are 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.770
 lose 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.470
 due to the difficulty of the intestine 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.560
 to absorb fat-soluble vitamins that 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.629
 dissolve in fat in omnilife we use 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.300
 a system that revolutionized nutrition 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.210
 the mission 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.160
 Mass is to make 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.160
 oily vitamins like those of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.590
 complex complex to absorb 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.780
 coated with micro molecules of water to 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.930
 let the intestine let them pass as if 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.480
 out of water this way you get 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.490
 increase from two to five times the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.790
 absorption of nutrients in the wall 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.790
 intestinal
