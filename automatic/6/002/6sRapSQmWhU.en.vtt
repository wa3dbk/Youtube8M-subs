wreath<00:00:29.550> rose<00:00:30.230> but<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.980> if

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
wreath rose but that's what it is and if

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
wreath rose but that's what it is and if
you<00:00:32.189> already<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.180> then<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.600> good

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you already know this then that's good

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810 
you already know this then that's good
and<00:00:34.410> that's<00:00:34.770> probably<00:00:35.190> because<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.550> went

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and that's probably because you went

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
and that's probably because you went
down<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> channel<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> looked<00:00:37.290> in

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
down here on the channel and looked in

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.000 
down here on the channel and looked in
my<00:00:37.559> video<00:00:37.860> descriptions<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:39.780> describing<00:00:40.770> what

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.550 
pentagons I think but anyway they do not
have<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> variant<00:03:55.080> it's<00:03:55.290> just

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
have that on the variant it's just

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
really know how completely tall these

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.190 
really know how completely tall these
figures<00:06:50.370> are<00:06:50.550> they<00:06:51.180> say<00:06:51.390> six<00:06:51.630> inches<00:06:51.930> but<00:06:52.140> it

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
figures are they say six inches but it

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.330 
figures are they say six inches but it
could<00:06:52.350> be<00:06:52.500> six<00:06:52.710> in<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:52.860> quarter<00:06:53.070> could<00:06:53.220> be

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
could be six in the quarter could be

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.140 
could be six in the quarter could be
less<00:06:53.610> but<00:06:54.600> a<00:06:55.730> benefit<00:06:56.730> is<00:06:56.820> a<00:06:56.850> little<00:06:57.150> taller

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
less but a benefit is a little taller

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.970 
less but a benefit is a little taller
definitely<00:07:00.150> beefier<00:07:00.630> so<00:07:01.440> let's<00:07:01.650> go<00:07:01.770> ahead<00:07:01.830> and

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
definitely beefier so let's go ahead and

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.140 
definitely beefier so let's go ahead and
take<00:07:02.130> Ironman<00:07:02.520> out<00:07:02.670> of<00:07:02.760> the<00:07:02.820> picture<00:07:03.200> and<00:07:05.150> all
