00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
 Todd and 2 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.289
 Offer 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.279
 Uster 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.189
 if the hand was the driving force in the development of man then 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.730
 insert the considerations 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.039
 that in our hands 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.039
 also reflects our physical condition 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.139
 In any case, the sheer displeasure of this line wants to know that I have stress 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.120
 Schwinning from the sports office means nothing to certify these fine lines here 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.109
 her a tall Nuzzi sister Lent and the lifeline 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
 ends already here that does not promise anything good 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.600
 Fate shows in the palm of your hand 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.040
 It does not have to be that way but of course you can not rule it out seriously 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.520
 is Werner half-year with which the Schirn Ogi justified we in any case 160000 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.720
 Have finally studied to finally recognize connections 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.150
 Our author Jana Lembke has had her hands on her 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 I have an appointment with Joachim Schneider Heilpraktiker in many 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 Prop for ten years with the hand of the coast can and diseases 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.670
 or to recognize the equipment for it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630
 I'm curious what he Fink the font for me not completely for me 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.440
 healthy 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 Warsaw or expect a new year 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.830
 outside would have 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.990
 every fourth turn on one 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.850
 particular organ we first look at the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.950
 Weller 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.280
 They have 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.260
 somewhat calmer driving level 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.270
 why what Schumann record burden in Germany 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.600
 they are all distinct 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090
 you live here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 with Ziegler and skin off him 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.320
 we are responsible to their representatives if here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.410
 on the little finger no long and that means 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.530
 Note on behind Leipzig 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 like the court spokeswoman 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.659
 this area 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.010
 we are training 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 his car 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 4 can not happen to me i hope my life between beer is long 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.020
 but the heart 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.119
 yes, here too 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.409
 and this area fascinates him 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.080
 what matters is an exit as well 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.120
 The day after that already that should not expose Harold circle 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.840
 no stress 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.319
 that is a good piece of advice more important 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.609
 the Protestants 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.499
 that I knock it all down by hand 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.829
 the Lauterer from 2 4 zoom 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.779
 paid 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:31.660
 basically 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.819
 every 4 with respect to a specific organ 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 Konter lurked as I on their edge areas similar to the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.529
 reflexology 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:40.429
 is there 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.429
 Reflex effect in the hand thereby arises 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.029
 we are here in the area where there are signs 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.189
 for fresh in the lodging for 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.279
 also high 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.219
 this were for this 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.559
 in the area 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.049
 then we have yes after Schneider knows me in my medical history 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.189
 Of course not with the breaks he hits the black 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.639
 a few years ago i had a pelvic fracture as a kid i had with her 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.259
 Arms also broke the physique and clarified and otherwise as healthy 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.859
 I really had all the diseases that are my hand 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.379
 Schneider is known for his accurate diagnoses his waiting room 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.390
 more and more recently I had more due that are felt 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.439
 the next patient Niklas Schilling 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.540
 Nicolas is just four weeks old when the doctors were diagnosed 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.870
 Imagine damaging those who snow a lot knew better 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.499
 it's the first one 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:42.529
 World War II he is the oldest of the five bond purchases accompanied explained 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.289
 Ursula Frerichs said that, but it is definitely 30 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.649
 at the weekend 9 it is always criticism 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
 There one now also Niklaus must be operated upon 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.129
 the OKI date of a bad one is already fixed in two weeks she will be on 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.459
 Gut parried 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.569
 Joachim Schneider had found signs in his hand that did not matter with his gut 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.139
 okay is the exchange exists the oil 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.150
 in the basement duel of 2 8 percent 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.320
 Apple operates 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.249
 and when he's big in the tiebreaker 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.550
 after cutting copying his patients in the hands 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.639
 no matter how small they are 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.159
 He always confirms himself as he says his diagnoses 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.839
 but not always the signs of disease must become diseases 

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.789
 he stressed 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.449
 it is only the plants that humans have for this and that disease 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.509
 whether it breaks out child of lifestyles and other factors 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.629
 So I still have hope when I the next day in Wiesbaden the German 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.800
 Clinic for diagnostics he 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.279
 will confirm the hand diagnosis 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.279
 I'm already sick without realizing it 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.990
 That's why Professor Dieter Schneider says the route is based on my hand 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.680
 returns to the low point 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 how much truth in his opinion is contained in it 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.499
 her history with regard to buying tip fractures was allowed 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:12.749
 injury 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.279
 is completed 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.180
 around 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.499
 that does not occupy comment 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.310
 consider it possible that illnesses in the hand kempten 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.710
 we are from these plans 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.870
 personally 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.490
 percent 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.560
 50 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.629
 he is in coexistence in this regard 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.949
 if it is to change 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.589
 at the moment he is elected for the Turk colleagues 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.650
 a symptom 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.659
 to copy 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.610
 then we will not argue 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.910
 rr 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.209
