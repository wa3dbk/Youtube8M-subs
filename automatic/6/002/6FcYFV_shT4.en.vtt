it's pretty even right now around the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.780 
it's pretty even right now around the

so I'm going to fill in more of a black

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.890 
so I'm going to fill in more of a black
shape<00:03:03.330> around<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.140> eye<00:03:04.170> here

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
sorry is difficult on myself I can't

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.760 
sorry is difficult on myself I can't
really<00:03:13.450> see<00:03:13.629> what<00:03:13.750> i'm<00:03:13.840> doing<00:03:14.110> here<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.159> go

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.860 

hi<00:03:18.340> I'm<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.940> mimicking<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.510> shape<00:03:19.540> that's

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
hi I'm just mimicking the shape that's

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530 
hi I'm just mimicking the shape that's
above<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> really<00:03:20.940> maybe<00:03:21.940> taking<00:03:22.360> some

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
above it really maybe taking some

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.530 
above it really maybe taking some
liberties<00:03:22.660> but<00:03:23.050> that's<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.410> idea

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.479 

bring<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.319> down<00:03:29.349> closing<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.010> eye<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.340> then

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
bring it down closing the eye and then

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.550 
bring it down closing the eye and then
bringing<00:03:30.700> up<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:31.000> spike<00:03:34.140> if<00:03:35.140> you're<00:03:35.379> in<00:03:35.469> a<00:03:35.530> hurry

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
bringing up a spike if you're in a hurry

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.619 
bringing up a spike if you're in a hurry
you<00:03:35.950> could<00:03:36.069> just<00:03:36.219> make<00:03:36.549> this<00:03:36.730> space<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:37.299> black

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
you could just make this space all black

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.539 
you could just make this space all black
and<00:03:37.840> be<00:03:38.109> done<00:03:38.349> but<00:03:38.680> I'm<00:03:38.829> going<00:03:39.159> to<00:03:39.219> do<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.430> with

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
and be done but I'm going to do it with

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.920 
and be done but I'm going to do it with
some<00:03:39.730> shading<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.420> think<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.689> looks<00:03:40.870> cool

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.809 

so<00:03:46.500> I'm<00:03:46.620> filling<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.219> black<00:03:47.430> up<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
so I'm filling in the black up to the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.759 
so I'm filling in the black up to the
brow<00:03:48.030> here<00:03:51.260> then<00:03:52.260> I'm<00:03:52.349> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.530> grab<00:03:52.739> a

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
brow here then I'm going to grab a

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.599 
brow here then I'm going to grab a
sponge<00:03:56.780> with<00:03:57.780> some<00:03:58.319> glue<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.709> some<00:03:59.129> gray<00:03:59.400> on

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
sponge with some glue and some gray on

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.369 
sponge with some glue and some gray on
it<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.540> going<00:04:00.689> to<00:04:00.750> mix<00:04:00.930> together<00:04:01.079> right

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
it and I'm going to mix together right

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.800 
it and I'm going to mix together right
on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> sponge<00:04:02.120> because<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.359> sponge<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.659> was

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
on the sponge because the sponge I was

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.440 
on the sponge because the sponge I was
using<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.170> blue<00:04:04.760> why<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.939> try<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.329> just

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
using for blue why not try it with just

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.250 
using for blue why not try it with just
rule<00:04:07.909> put<00:04:08.909> it<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.150> right<00:04:09.359> over<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.689> black<00:04:09.900> and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
rule put it on right over the black and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.259 
rule put it on right over the black and
blend<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> black<00:04:10.889> up<00:04:11.069> into<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.549> this<00:04:11.939> is<00:04:12.060> just

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
blend the black up into it this is just

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.050 
blend the black up into it this is just
a<00:04:12.359> dfx<00:04:12.810> lake<00:04:13.079> blue<00:04:13.409> think<00:04:14.219> when<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> did<00:04:14.609> this<00:04:14.760> at

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
a dfx lake blue think when I did this at

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.770 
a dfx lake blue think when I did this at
my<00:04:15.209> event<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:15.689> actually<00:04:15.870> used<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.530> mix<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:18.479> FX

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
my event I actually used a mix of the FX

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.430 
my event I actually used a mix of the FX
black<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.320> snazz<00:04:19.739> royal<00:04:20.400> blue<00:04:21.139> it<00:04:22.139> doesn't

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
black and snazz royal blue it doesn't

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.600 
black and snazz royal blue it doesn't
matter<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.710> I'm<00:04:22.979> blending<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.460> black

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
matter because I'm blending the black

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.420 
matter because I'm blending the black
right<00:04:23.820> into<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.500> we<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.680> want<00:04:25.830> another<00:04:26.099> color

right into it we just want another color

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.300 
right into it we just want another color
to<00:04:27.530> kind<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.590> contrast<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:30.860> I'm<00:04:31.860> putting<00:04:32.099> it<00:04:32.190> on

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
to kind of contrast it I'm putting it on

to kind of contrast it I'm putting it on
right<00:04:32.550> over<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:32.880> black<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.240> pulling<00:04:33.479> the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
right over the black and pulling the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.390 
right over the black and pulling the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
black right into it i'm just giving it a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.070 
black right into it i'm just giving it a
little<00:04:35.550> bit<00:04:35.759> more<00:04:35.910> shadowing<00:04:36.509> more<00:04:36.810> depth

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
little bit more shadowing more depth

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.909 
little bit more shadowing more depth
than<00:04:37.169> if<00:04:37.380> I'd<00:04:37.530> only<00:04:37.560> don't<00:04:38.070> black<00:04:39.740> I'm<00:04:40.740> going
