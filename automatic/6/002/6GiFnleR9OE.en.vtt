00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
if you want to get good at endurance

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.960 
if you want to get good at endurance
routes<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.220> first<00:00:02.399> thing<00:00:02.550> you've<00:00:02.639> got<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.820> do

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
routes the first thing you've got to do

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.869 
routes the first thing you've got to do
is<00:00:03.090> build<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.419> good<00:00:03.540> base<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.810> work<00:00:04.170> from<00:00:04.279> a<00:00:05.279> good

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
is build a good base to work from a good

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
is build a good base to work from a good
exercise<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.960> simply<00:00:07.350> staying<00:00:07.799> on

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
exercise for that is simply staying on

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.400 
exercise for that is simply staying on
the<00:00:08.069> wall<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.639> 20<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> 30<00:00:09.210> minutes<00:00:09.540> with<00:00:10.380> a

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
the wall for 20 to 30 minutes with a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.070 
the wall for 20 to 30 minutes with a
light<00:00:10.710> level<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.160> pump<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.790> you'll<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.690> maybe<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
light level of pump so you'll be maybe a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
light level of pump so you'll be maybe a
little<00:00:13.110> bit<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> breath<00:00:13.889> you'll<00:00:14.309> feel<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
little bit out of breath you'll feel a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.430 
little bit out of breath you'll feel a
lot<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.030> extra<00:00:15.330> blood<00:00:15.509> flow<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.839> your<00:00:15.870> forearms

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
lot of extra blood flow in your forearms

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.050 
lot of extra blood flow in your forearms
will<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:16.949> slightly<00:00:17.220> pumped<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.760> you'll<00:00:17.910> still

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
will be slightly pumped but you'll still

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
will be slightly pumped but you'll still
be<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.300> control<00:00:18.660> if<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> stop

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
be in control if you have to stop

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.679 
be in control if you have to stop
because<00:00:20.520> someone<00:00:20.880> else<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> way<00:00:21.480> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
because someone else is in the way it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.179 
because someone else is in the way it's
not<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> big<00:00:22.080> problem<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> stop<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
not a big problem for you to stop and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.700 
not a big problem for you to stop and
just<00:00:23.340> shake<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> simply<00:00:25.410> start<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
just shake out so simply start a

just shake out so simply start a
stopwatch<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> wall<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> keep<00:00:27.539> going

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
stopwatch get on the wall and keep going

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
stopwatch get on the wall and keep going
until<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.650> bored<00:00:28.920> or

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
until you get really really bored or

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.550 
until you get really really bored or
your<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.699> foot<00:00:29.910> runs<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.269> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.260> want<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
your right foot runs out if you want to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
your right foot runs out if you want to
mix<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:33.630> try

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
mix it up a little bit you can also try

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.299 
mix it up a little bit you can also try
doing<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.500> ten<00:00:34.800> minutes<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
doing things like ten minutes on the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.310 
doing things like ten minutes on the
wall<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.640> ten<00:00:35.850> minutes<00:00:36.120> off<00:00:36.270> allow<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> do

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
wall and ten minutes off allow you to do

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.569 
wall and ten minutes off allow you to do
some<00:00:37.500> slightly<00:00:37.800> harder<00:00:38.070> climbing<00:00:38.460> when

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
some slightly harder climbing when

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
some slightly harder climbing when
you're<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> wall<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.719> count<00:00:40.079> up

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you're on the wall and you can count up

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.270 
you're on the wall and you can count up
the<00:00:40.440> amount<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.219> spending

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the amount of time that you're spending

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
the amount of time that you're spending
on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> wall<00:00:41.850> each<00:00:42.030> week<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.290> try<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.590> build

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
on the wall each week and try and build

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.490 
on the wall each week and try and build
that<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.879> build<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.690> bigger<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> bigger

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that up to build up a bigger and bigger

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
that up to build up a bigger and bigger
base<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:47.129> endurance<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.390> prepares

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
base of endurance work and that prepares

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
base of endurance work and that prepares
you<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.200> well<00:00:49.320> both<00:00:50.070> belong<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> sites<00:00:50.879> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you really well both belong on sites in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
you really well both belong on sites in
particular<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:52.170> long<00:00:52.350> trade<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.800> sites<00:00:53.100> as

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
particular for long trade on sites as

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740 
particular for long trade on sites as
well<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> sort<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> fitness<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> really

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
well that sort of fitness is really

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
well that sort of fitness is really
important<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.579> builds<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> base<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
important but also it builds a base to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
important but also it builds a base to
work<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.690> higher<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:58.199> power<00:00:58.620> endurance<00:00:59.129> for

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
work the higher end power endurance for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
work the higher end power endurance for
so<00:00:59.850> even<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> interested<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so even if you're interested in some of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.029 
so even if you're interested in some of
the<00:01:01.260> shorter<00:01:01.590> routes

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the shorter routes

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
the shorter routes
it's<00:01:02.370> still<00:01:02.640> worth<00:01:02.850> having<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:03.809> base<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it's still worth having a good base of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
it's still worth having a good base of
endurance<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> type<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> training<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
endurance from that type of training to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
endurance from that type of training to
work<00:01:06.750> from<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.439> normally<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> couple<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.640> months

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
work from so normally a couple of months

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
work from so normally a couple of months
before<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> trip<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> before<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> want

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
before I go on a trip to before I want

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.969 
before I go on a trip to before I want
to<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.130> fit<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.790> my<00:01:11.880> route<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.500> training

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to be fit for my route of start training

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
to be fit for my route of start training
the<00:01:14.580> higher<00:01:14.790> end<00:01:15.060> endurance<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> power

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the higher end endurance and power

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.580 
the higher end endurance and power
endurance<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> there's<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:18.600> main<00:01:18.900> ways<00:01:18.930> I'd

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
endurance and there's two main ways I'd

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
endurance and there's two main ways I'd
train<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.180> training<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.920> pumpy

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
train that so if I'm training for pumpy

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
train that so if I'm training for pumpy
route<00:01:23.100> where<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.610> gonna<00:01:23.729> fall<00:01:24.000> off<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.659> my

route where I'm gonna fall off with my

route where I'm gonna fall off with my
arm<00:01:24.960> screaming<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.950> barely<00:01:26.460> sort<00:01:27.270> of

and quite a good exercise is simply to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.100 
and quite a good exercise is simply to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
circuit so that you can get round maybe

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
circuit so that you can get round maybe
six<00:02:18.670> or<00:02:18.819> seven<00:02:18.880> repetitions<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.900> then<00:02:19.989> you're

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
six or seven repetitions and then you're

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.449 
six or seven repetitions and then you're
failing<00:02:20.349> on<00:02:20.650> your<00:02:20.770> seventh<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.340> eights

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.430 
failing on your seventh and your eights
repetition<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.209> usually<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> good<00:02:23.260> level

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
repetition that's usually a good level

hard routes where you'll get really

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
powered down small off a move but then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.690 
powered down small off a move but then
you'll<00:02:31.780> actually<00:02:32.260> not<00:02:32.620> be<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:33.310> pumped

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
you'll actually not be that pumped

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.479 
you'll actually not be that pumped
thirty<00:02:34.030> seconds<00:02:34.390> later<00:02:35.010> you've<00:02:36.010> got<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.190> couple

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
thirty seconds later you've got a couple

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.580 
thirty seconds later you've got a couple
of<00:02:36.550> other<00:02:36.670> options<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.349> take<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
of other options so one is to take a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.610 
of other options so one is to take a
circuit<00:02:39.099> just<00:02:39.280> right<00:02:39.489> at<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.760> limit<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
circuit just right at your limit and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
again a continuous circuit without too

many proxies and too many easier
sections<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.600> best<00:02:46.780> way<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.930> train<00:02:47.200> this

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
sections is the best way to train this

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.729 
sections is the best way to train this
and<00:02:47.739> simply<00:02:48.250> try<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.489> read<00:02:48.730> point<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.620> five<00:02:50.620> as

that's<00:03:04.239> okay<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:05.019> all<00:03:05.110> about<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.470> quality

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
that's okay it's all about the quality

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.410 
that's okay it's all about the quality
rather<00:03:06.099> than<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> quantity<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.030> sort<00:03:07.390> of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
rather than the quantity on that sort of

rather than the quantity on that sort of
training<00:03:07.630> another<00:03:08.349> way<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:08.860> train

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
training another way that you can train

training another way that you can train
the<00:03:09.400> short<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.180> hard<00:03:10.360> power<00:03:10.630> endurance<00:03:11.019> is<00:03:11.410> by

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the short and hard power endurance is by

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.849 
the short and hard power endurance is by
picking<00:03:12.400> for<00:03:12.700> Boulder<00:03:13.030> problems<00:03:13.829> there<00:03:14.829> are

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
picking for Boulder problems there are

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.620 
picking for Boulder problems there are
quite<00:03:15.070> hard<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:16.180> doing<00:03:16.420> them

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
quite hard for you and doing them

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.080 
quite hard for you and doing them
back-to-back<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.340> short<00:03:18.579> rest

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
back-to-back with just a short rest

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.319 
back-to-back with just a short rest
so<00:03:19.630> do<00:03:19.989> problem<00:03:20.440> drop<00:03:20.680> off<00:03:20.890> chalk<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:22.180> want

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
so do problem drop off chalk up you want

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.030 
so do problem drop off chalk up you want
to<00:03:22.390> rest<00:03:22.600> for<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> length<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.769> time

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to rest for a length of time

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920 
to rest for a length of time
there's<00:03:24.640> comparable<00:03:25.329> to<00:03:25.450> what<00:03:25.569> you're<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
there's comparable to what you're on the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.809 
there's comparable to what you're on the
rule<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.380> or<00:03:26.680> even<00:03:27.040> shorter<00:03:27.370> than<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.579> so

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
rule for or even shorter than that so

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.220 
rule for or even shorter than that so
literally<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.269> dropping<00:03:28.630> off<00:03:28.720> choking<00:03:29.140> up

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
literally just dropping off choking up

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.930 
literally just dropping off choking up
and<00:03:29.410> pulling<00:03:29.620> back<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.100> easy<00:03:30.400> enough<00:03:30.489> if

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
and pulling back on it's easy enough if

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.880 
and pulling back on it's easy enough if
you<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.840> four<00:03:32.079> world<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.410> problems<00:03:32.590> like<00:03:32.859> that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
you do four world of problems like that

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.759 
you do four world of problems like that
that<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:34.150> equivalent<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.959> doing<00:03:35.079> your<00:03:35.350> circuit

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that is equivalent of doing your circuit

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.460 
that is equivalent of doing your circuit
so<00:03:35.950> then<00:03:36.100> again<00:03:36.370> take<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.940> long<00:03:37.209> rest<00:03:37.470> ten

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
so then again take a long rest ten

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.620 
so then again take a long rest ten
fifteen<00:03:38.950> minutes<00:03:39.310> even<00:03:39.880> more<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.269> need<00:03:40.420> to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
fifteen minutes even more if you need to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.990 
fifteen minutes even more if you need to
pull<00:03:41.470> back<00:03:41.620> on<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.519> try<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:42.970> same

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
pull back on and try and do the same

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.319 
pull back on and try and do the same
again<00:03:43.389> if<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.290> try<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> do<00:03:44.819> four<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:46.060> six

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
again if you try to do four to six

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.210 
again if you try to do four to six
repetitions<00:03:46.720> as<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.380> that's<00:03:47.889> usually<00:03:48.040> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
repetitions as that that's usually a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.460 
repetitions as that that's usually a
pretty<00:03:48.340> good<00:03:48.459> workout<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.269> usually<00:03:49.959> after

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
pretty good workout and usually after

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.470 
pretty good workout and usually after
doing<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.250> sort<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> shorter<00:03:52.180> more<00:03:52.420> intense

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
doing that sort of shorter more intense

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.300 
doing that sort of shorter more intense
power<00:03:53.049> endurance<00:03:53.290> you'll<00:03:53.980> still<00:03:54.220> have

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
power endurance you'll still have

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.250

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
it's a lot more time efficient if you're

structured and time your rest and do
everything<00:04:35.080> perfectly<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.130> bouldering

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
everything perfectly then a bouldering

everything perfectly then a bouldering
wall<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.820> usually<00:04:37.150> much<00:04:37.270> easier<00:04:37.330> at<00:04:37.750> these<00:04:38.190> so

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
wall is usually much easier at these so

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.520 
wall is usually much easier at these so
ereve<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.380> quite<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:42.240> mixture<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.630> styles<00:04:44.170> of

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
ereve is quite a mixture of styles of

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.470 
ereve is quite a mixture of styles of
endurance<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.340> from<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.030> bottom<00:04:46.300> section

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
endurance you from the bottom section

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.420 
endurance you from the bottom section
you<00:04:46.810> need<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.200> sort<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.530> short<00:04:47.800> hard<00:04:48.100> power

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
you need that sort of short hard power

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.030 
you need that sort of short hard power
endurance<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:50.050> train<00:04:50.380> for<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.890> made<00:04:51.010> a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
endurance to train for that and made a

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.940 
endurance to train for that and made a
lot<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> replica<00:04:51.820> circuits<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:53.110> would<00:04:53.800> do<00:04:53.920> a

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
lot of replica circuits I would do a

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.060 
lot of replica circuits I would do a
replica<00:04:54.190> circuit<00:04:54.910> is<00:04:55.570> maybe<00:04:55.810> around<00:04:55.960> 8p<00:04:56.590> and

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
replica circuit is maybe around 8p and

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.620 
replica circuit is maybe around 8p and
then<00:04:57.160> it'd<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.430> short<00:04:57.730> rest<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.240> then<00:04:58.510> I'd

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
then it'd have a short rest and then I'd

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.360 
then it'd have a short rest and then I'd
go<00:04:58.810> into<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.140> long<00:04:59.380> Boulder<00:04:59.770> problem<00:05:00.070> which<00:05:00.220> is

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
go into a long Boulder problem which is

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.770 
go into a long Boulder problem which is
what<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.610> crux<00:05:00.820> was<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.300> then<00:05:01.750> just

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
what the crux was and then just

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.810 
what the crux was and then just
gradually<00:05:02.110> reduce<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.710> rest<00:05:03.130> between<00:05:03.669> the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
gradually reduce the rest between the

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.580 
gradually reduce the rest between the
circuit<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.390> boulder<00:05:04.630> problem<00:05:04.750> until<00:05:05.470> it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
circuit and the boulder problem until it

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.010 
circuit and the boulder problem until it
could<00:05:05.710> climb<00:05:05.890> one<00:05:06.160> straight<00:05:06.490> into<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.820> other

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
could climb one straight into the other

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
could climb one straight into the other
then<00:05:08.020> for<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.680> top<00:05:08.860> section<00:05:09.100> which<00:05:09.520> is<00:05:09.700> easier

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
then for the top section which is easier

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.300 
then for the top section which is easier
moves<00:05:10.480> but<00:05:10.810> you're<00:05:11.169> pretty<00:05:11.350> pumped<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.770> climb

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
the rock to get there I was doing more

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.030 
the rock to get there I was doing more
of<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.280> style<00:05:15.600> where<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.630> would<00:05:16.960> do<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.590> circuit

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
of the style where I would do a circuit

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.470 
of the style where I would do a circuit
to<00:05:18.160> say<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.310> minute<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.700> half<00:05:18.730> rest<00:05:19.300> for<00:05:19.450> a

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
minute and a half or often you can do

foot on canvasing exercises that work

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.810 
foot on canvasing exercises that work
really<00:05:23.410> well<00:05:23.620> for<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:23.979> style<00:05:24.250> of<00:05:24.370> endurance

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
really well for that style of endurance

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.320 
really well for that style of endurance
as<00:05:25.000> well<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.810> spend<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:27.280> minute<00:05:27.430> put<00:05:28.210> on

rest<00:05:30.490> for<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.700> minute

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
rest for a minute

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.210 
rest for a minute
and<00:05:31.120> repeat<00:05:31.660> that<00:05:31.840> again<00:05:32.140> for<00:05:32.710> again<00:05:33.070> between

6<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.790> 8<00:05:33.820> reps<00:05:34.060> if<00:05:34.300> you're<00:05:34.419> failing<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.780> the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
6 and 8 reps if you're failing on the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.540 
6 and 8 reps if you're failing on the
last<00:05:35.020> couple<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.380> reps<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> good<00:05:36.070> level<00:05:36.250> and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
last couple of reps is a good level and

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.400 
last couple of reps is a good level and
with<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.450> can<00:05:37.600> just<00:05:37.630> gradually<00:05:38.140> reduce

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
with that you can just gradually reduce

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.020 
with that you can just gradually reduce
the<00:05:38.440> rest<00:05:38.740> time<00:05:38.950> so<00:05:39.250> if<00:05:39.340> one<00:05:39.490> we<00:05:39.669> could<00:05:39.940> do

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
the rest time so if one we could do

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.450 
the rest time so if one we could do
minute<00:05:40.330> on<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.990> then<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.200> minute<00:05:41.470> resting<00:05:41.830> the

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
minute on and then a minute resting the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.980 
minute on and then a minute resting the
next<00:05:42.700> week<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:43.030> can<00:05:43.180> do<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.300> minute<00:05:43.690> on<00:05:43.810> and

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
next week you can do a minute on and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.110 
next week you can do a minute on and
then<00:05:44.080> 50<00:05:44.440> seconds<00:05:44.770> resting<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.880> next

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
then 50 seconds resting and the next

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.150 
then 50 seconds resting and the next
week<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.540> mean<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.840> on<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.080> 45<00:05:47.470> seconds<00:05:47.800> resting

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
week I mean it on and 45 seconds resting

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.010 
week I mean it on and 45 seconds resting
and<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.460> try<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.640> keep<00:05:49.120> reducing<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.750> rest

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
and just try and keep reducing that rest

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.900 
and just try and keep reducing that rest
more<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.440> more<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:50.830> suddenly<00:05:51.280> you'll<00:05:51.640> find

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
more and more and suddenly you'll find

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.360 
more and more and suddenly you'll find
that<00:05:52.150> six<00:05:52.540> weeks<00:05:52.720> down<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:53.020> line<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:54.250> can

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
that six weeks down the line you can

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.130 
that six weeks down the line you can
actually<00:05:54.490> do<00:05:55.030> those<00:05:55.180> exercises<00:05:55.690> we've<00:05:56.020> been

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
actually do those exercises we've been

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.360 
actually do those exercises we've been
much<00:05:56.260> much<00:05:56.470> less<00:05:56.680> rest<00:05:56.950> than<00:05:57.190> we<00:05:57.250> were<00:05:57.340> doing

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
much much less rest than we were doing

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.440 
much much less rest than we were doing
at<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.729> start<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.210> session<00:05:58.419> on<00:05:59.080> face

Bentham Allen quite a lot recently I'm
pretty<00:06:05.920> keen<00:06:06.070> from<00:06:06.310> Alan<00:06:06.520> Kinsey<00:06:06.970> this<00:06:07.150> summer

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
pretty keen from Alan Kinsey this summer

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.410 
pretty keen from Alan Kinsey this summer
it's<00:06:09.190> quite<00:06:09.310> a<00:06:09.340> lot<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.550> good<00:06:09.700> endurance<00:06:10.000> roots

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
it's quite a lot of good endurance roots

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.450 
it's quite a lot of good endurance roots
at<00:06:10.540> Mullen<00:06:10.780> actually<00:06:11.080> did<00:06:11.950> that<00:06:12.100> route<00:06:12.310> the

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
at Mullen actually did that route the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.340 
at Mullen actually did that route the
