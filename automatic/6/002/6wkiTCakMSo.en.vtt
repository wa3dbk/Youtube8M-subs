00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.918
Actions of Iran have
shocked the civilized world.

00:00:12.703 --> 00:00:14.875
Lets go lets lets go!
-Shred everything!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.060
The embassy has been ceased and
more than sixty americans citizens...

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:21.585
continue to be held as hostages.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.916
If we're going to go then,
we need to go now!

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.306
What happened?

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:31.960
-Six of the hostages
went out a back exit.

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:34.780
Where are they?
The Canadian Embassador's house.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.251
You got revolutionary guards
going door-to-door

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.626
If these people die, they die badly.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.830
White House wants the six of them out.

00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:45.310
What we lack for this

00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:46.600
are bicycles.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.090
Deliver the six bikes
provide them with maps.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.425
Or you could just send in training
wheels and meet them at the border

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:53.090
with gatorade.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.376
It's going to take a
miracle to get them out.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.230
Buddy man, what are we watching?

00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:04.168
I got an idea. They're a canadian film
crew for a science fiction movie.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.700
I fly in to Tehran. We all fly out
together as a film crew.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.570
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.716
So, you want to come to Hollywood,
act like a big shot

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.450
without actually doing anything?
-Yea.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:16.610
You'll fit right in.

00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:18.170
You need a script.
-Argo.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.490
Science fantasy adventure.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:22.750
Landscape - Mars, desert.
-We need an exoctic location to shoot.

00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.340
You need a producer.
-If I'm doing a fake movie

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:27.520
it's going to be a fake hit.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:29.251
You don't have a better
bad idea than this?

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:31.708
This is the best bad idea we have sir

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:33.376
by far.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.835
You have seventy-two
hours to get them out.

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:41.833
You're getting a visitor.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:43.626
You've gotten people
out this way before?

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:45.000
No.

00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:47.835
You're asking us to
trust you with our lives.

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:48.958
This is what I do.

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:51.918
and I've never left anyone behind.

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:54.793
I know who they are and I know they're hiding out.

00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:56.208
It's over Tony.

00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.710
If they stay here, they will be taken.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.835
probably not alive.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.416
We're responsible for these people.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.041
I'm responsible.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:21.258
You really believe your little story
is going to make a difference

00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:22.650
when there's a gun to our heads?

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:24.133
I think my little story
is the only thing

00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:25.293
between you and a gun to your head.
