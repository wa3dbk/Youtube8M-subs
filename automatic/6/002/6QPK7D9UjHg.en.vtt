00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
okay for fpv plan I've got a full

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.609 
okay for fpv plan I've got a full
13-inch<00:02:04.680> Craig<00:02:05.220> monitor<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:07.020> seems<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.440> work

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
13-inch Craig monitor that seems to work

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.449 
13-inch Craig monitor that seems to work
really<00:02:07.650> well<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> blue<00:02:11.069> screen

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
really well it does do the blue screen

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.580 
really well it does do the blue screen
but<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.180> gets<00:02:12.270> quite<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> bit<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.870> static<00:02:13.230> before

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but it gets quite a bit of static before

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
but it gets quite a bit of static before
it<00:02:13.680> completely<00:02:14.220> cuts<00:02:14.580> out<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:15.720> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it completely cuts out so I'm going to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.630 
it completely cuts out so I'm going to
head<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.020> try<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.489> any

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
head and try it and if I have any

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.990 
head and try it and if I have any
problems<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.540> I've<00:02:18.870> got<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:20.000> RF

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
problems with it at all I've got my RF

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240 
problems with it at all I've got my RF
modulator<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:22.350> I'll<00:02:22.500> take<00:02:22.709> care<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.100> all

again goes back to that one switch one

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.240 
again goes back to that one switch one
more<00:03:46.720> time<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.819> comes<00:03:49.000> back<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:50.250> I

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
more time and it comes back to this I

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.649 
more time and it comes back to this I
like<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:51.670> one<00:03:51.760> better<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.360> little<00:03:52.540> bit

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
like this one better it's a little bit

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:59.970 
like this one better it's a little bit
cleaner<00:03:53.099> it's<00:03:54.099> got<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> GPS<00:03:58.349> strength<00:03:59.349> right

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
cleaner it's got the GPS strength right

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.520 
cleaner it's got the GPS strength right
up<00:04:00.099> here<00:04:00.250> satellite<00:04:00.819> strength<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.329> there

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
up here satellite strength right there

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.990 
up here satellite strength right there
it<00:04:02.530> still<00:04:02.829> got<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.190> return<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.819> home

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
it still got the return to home

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.520 
it still got the return to home
direction<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:05.709> on<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.010> bottom<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:07.360> puts<00:04:07.720> my

compass shows my home also here distance

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.199 
compass shows my home also here distance
here<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.280> side<00:04:15.519> I've<00:04:15.879> got<00:04:16.090> my

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.979 
here and then on this side I've got my
video<00:04:16.389> voltage<00:04:17.019> my<00:04:17.620> power<00:04:17.889> voltage<00:04:18.989> current

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
video voltage my power voltage current

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.980 
video voltage my power voltage current
draw<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.949> then<00:04:21.940> how<00:04:22.150> many<00:04:22.210> milliamps<00:04:22.870> I've

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
draw and then how many milliamps I've

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.550 
draw and then how many milliamps I've
used<00:04:23.289> since<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> last<00:04:23.830> reset<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.410> this

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
used since the last reset and on this

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.060 
used since the last reset and on this
side<00:04:26.770> over<00:04:26.949> here<00:04:27.100> it's<00:04:27.580> got<00:04:28.530> feet<00:04:29.530> per<00:04:29.680> second

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
side over here it's got feet per second

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.590 
side over here it's got feet per second
which<00:04:30.190> is<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.490> help<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:31.210> know<00:04:31.330> if<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:31.510> going

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
which is you help you know if it's going

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.240 
which is you help you know if it's going
to<00:04:31.690> pizza<00:04:31.840> positive<00:04:32.440> you're<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:32.770> up<00:04:32.979> so

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
to pizza positive you're going up so

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.680 
to pizza positive you're going up so
many<00:04:33.340> Peter<00:04:33.760> second<00:04:34.060> if<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.270> negative<00:04:34.419> you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
many Peter second if it's negative you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.529 
many Peter second if it's negative you
going<00:04:34.900> down<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.289> many<00:04:35.350> feet<00:04:35.650> per<00:04:35.800> second<00:04:36.539> miles

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
going down so many feet per second miles

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.909 
going down so many feet per second miles
per<00:04:37.720> hour<00:04:37.900> here<00:04:38.280> help<00:04:39.280> steamed<00:04:39.669> here<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.919> the

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
per hour here help steamed here and the

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.760 
per hour here help steamed here and the
time<00:04:42.160> in<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.400> air<00:04:42.550> right<00:04:42.580> there<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:44.590> much

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
time in the air right there so it's much

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.860 
time in the air right there so it's much
cleaner<00:04:45.099> all<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.240> data<00:04:46.479> is<00:04:46.599> across<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
cleaner all the data is across the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.510 
cleaner all the data is across the
bottom<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:49.979> so<00:04:50.979> yeah<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.099> think<00:04:51.130> that's<00:04:51.430> going

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
bottom and so yeah I think that's going

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.010 
bottom and so yeah I think that's going
to<00:04:51.580> work<00:04:51.669> better<00:04:52.000> for<00:04:52.270> me<00:04:52.360> right<00:04:52.539> there<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
to work better for me right there the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.540 
to work better for me right there the
other<00:04:53.139> thing<00:04:53.349> is<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.800> you're<00:04:54.070> flying<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.460> it's

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
other thing is if you're flying and it's

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.420 
other thing is if you're flying and it's
got<00:04:54.700> data<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.150> top<00:04:55.889> you're<00:04:56.889> flying<00:04:57.160> you

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
got data on the top you're flying you

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.490 
got data on the top you're flying you
got<00:04:57.580> clouds<00:04:57.910> it's<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.750> sky<00:04:59.020> it's<00:04:59.320> very

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
got clouds it's in the sky it's very

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.260 
got clouds it's in the sky it's very
difficult<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.039> think<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.250> read<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.729> numbers<00:05:01.090> so

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
difficult I think to read the numbers so

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.279 
difficult I think to read the numbers so
if<00:05:01.300> everything's<00:05:01.750> down<00:05:01.930> on<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.169> bottom

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
if everything's down on the bottom

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.690 
if everything's down on the bottom
usually<00:05:02.620> that's<00:05:02.919> going<00:05:03.039> to<00:05:03.099> be<00:05:03.160> your<00:05:03.280> darker

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
usually that's going to be your darker

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.580 
usually that's going to be your darker
area<00:05:04.539> of<00:05:04.630> your<00:05:04.810> screen<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.349> a<00:05:05.410> little<00:05:05.500> bit

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
area of your screen so it's a little bit

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.129 
area of your screen so it's a little bit
easier<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.979> read<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.150> yeah<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.810> got<00:05:07.930> everything

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
easier to read so yeah I got everything

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.830 
easier to read so yeah I got everything
hooked<00:05:08.380> up<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.800> ready<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.099> go<00:05:09.570> hopefully<00:05:10.570> it

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
hooked up and ready to go hopefully it

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:22.050 
hooked up and ready to go hopefully it
will<00:05:10.960> be<00:05:11.110> flying<00:05:11.320> here<00:05:11.620> pretty<00:05:11.830> soon

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:55.380 

you

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.450 

you
