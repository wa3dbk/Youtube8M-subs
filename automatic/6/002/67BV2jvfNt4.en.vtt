00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.900
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.009
 plants book 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.580
 very often we are asked a question show 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.590
 I didn't know plants to cry 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.460
 what to answer this question and there was 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.309
 already very much for legs 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.370
 now I know for sure that almost everything 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 Aroid and many other plants except 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.960
 this kind 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.760
 give this species 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.549
 on a sheet of water droplets if changing 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.210
 air humidity in the street if you go 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.489
 how the rain counts on the spathiphyllum 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.250
 whether nostromo on monsters 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.489
 us and Odessa or what they call us 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.880
 feces on many other plants 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.560
 little by little 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.600
 expire at philodendron by the way too 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 the most expire in the foot 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.700
 she's going to a sheet groove and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.979
 dripping from place to floor so she 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.510
 shows us not only 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.030
 tramontana any plant what plan 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.760
 shows that it will rain soon 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 even if you see that the sky is bright 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.930
 the sun is still not fool the plant 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.979
 she feels it from afar 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 plus if you spray a plant often 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.020
 either this land 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 either the humidity in your house 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 why k too tall plant too 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.509
 it will show you even if 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.970
 the street is warm enough and you have somewhere 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.720
 there is a water leak plant you about it 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020
 will say 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.330
 he, too, will accumulate this drop 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.920
 water and you will understand that the humidity 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.660
 the house is much bigger than it should be 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.910
 so when such a hint about this 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.500
 very well and all people endure 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.100
 high humidity indoor 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.470
 where they live and sleep 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.320
 so look at your plants 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
 they will show you when 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.010
 rain 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.080
 Is there high humidity in your house then 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.200
 gently smile at you and say calm 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.930
 nights love your plants and they will 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.090
