 Hello everyone, danchik 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 and today I will teach you how to put 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.450
 correct namapi inferno so that we 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 could calmly counter 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.890
 counter-terrorist but stupidly could not break 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890
 to fish 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:37.370
 first on the point and I must say it 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:41.629
 come to the edge of the jump he sat down we 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 we put the pent down we have given vision in 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.360
 the library that is, it cannot 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.329
 hide behind this box will we 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.129
 leave everything as is already possible to see 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.339
 hide in jail 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.820
 when it will deposit either top 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:05.140
 here on either get out already surely and 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 below either either in the sands we all see 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.590
 where do I come from here with my help 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.370
 also exit the carpet and immediately see 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.980
 the enemy can even be necessary here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.390
 here it is just so and now we are at the point 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.130
 b and we will also put the pate come 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 the edge of the fountain jump it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.010
 a little forward video and set the tempo 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.540
 thereby we can leave the church and 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:45.840
 we can immediately kill the enemy 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.840
 hide behind the barrels and take down the enemy 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.560
 either here for these daughters also shoot 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.540
 the enemy right away also has anyone from 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.810
 yours will go from a banana to compare 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 I understand the enemy that is stricter here 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 will his head girl cho there sew 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.890
 also when they will go from the base 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 of sources 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 here we go a little bit and see 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.660
