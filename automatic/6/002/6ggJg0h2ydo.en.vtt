00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 The popular non-layer style is nicely integrated but hard to move, 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 If such a problem is iron, it is one shot solution. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Round out the curve in the middle part of the tuft, with an accent on the tip of the hair is doubled. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 After towel drying, while blowing up the hair, apply wind to the roots to dry. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Blow dry the whole completely. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Especially around the face I put an inner wrap around the face to add a peculiarity. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The hair bundle just above the ear is pinched at the straight part and stretched to form a loose curve. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 The side and back surfaces are forward wound. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Place the iron in the middle of the hair bundle and pull it up to the end of the hair. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 I will leave the side of the side of the outside of the left and right two places. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Not too involved, only half-turn hair tip OK. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 The bangs are divided into the inside and the surface. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 First, pinch the inner hair tips and lift the tufts to raise them. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Next is the surface of the bangs. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Squeeze the middle of the hair bundle and let it go inward while lifting at a right angle. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Thin milk for curly hair, hold hair from below, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Include air while breaking up the tufts. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The whole impression is soft, and only the face is surrounded by a curve close to a straight line 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 There is also a crispy spice in the sweetness. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 In addition, I make the outside of the point at the point and express a fresh dynamic feeling.
