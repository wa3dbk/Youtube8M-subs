00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.420
 the fruit and the seed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 once most of the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.530
 seeds in the carports have been 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.529
 fertilized 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.810
 the flower falls leaving the fruit and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.050
 seeds in a training process and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050
 increase 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.150
 inside the carpers are going to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.820
 locate the seeds in the process of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.010
 ripening inside the seeds 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.200
 you are going to find a triploid nucleus 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.870
 that will form the endosperm and a 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.160
 diploid nucleus with diploid cell in 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.800
 this case that will form the embryo in 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.559
 first instance the triploid nuclei 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.720
 they are going to perform a very fast mitosis 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.690
 to form the cute term that goes to 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.909
 be a highly nutritious tissue the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 embryo on your part is going to be divided into 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.620
 two sections the first section will 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.019
 call suspense here colored purple 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.019
 and in the middle as such in yellow 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.880
 the main function of suspense is the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.850
 of providing nutrients to the embryo during 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.909
 your first training process 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.280
 once the embryo has grown what 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.750
 enough to proceed to absorb 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.150
 nutrients by itself from slow bolts 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.740
 the embryo will also proceed to 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.060
 differentiate into two sections 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.100
 the embryo as such and the cotillion in the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.159
 tip 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.729
 to identify those two sections 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.429
 the embryo generates something called pro mule 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.329
 that will form the first sheets in 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.319
 English of those embryonic feathers are 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.319
 call shot tip 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.250
 the cooked type is the lowest part of the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.860
 embryo and that is what will form the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.050
 first root 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.050
 as the embryo goes on worshiping 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 the seed as such is going to grow and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.690
 accumulating nutrients 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.670
 when it has matured enough 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.870
 seed emits water and the embryo remains in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.440
 a latency state 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.060
 in the chicota ideal 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 the cotillions are going to grow much more 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 absorbing in two terms 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.270
 finally the shell of the seeds will 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.870
 will harden 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.610
 thus creating the mature seed at the same 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.530
 time the fruit will appear in the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.120
 fleshy fruits is going to accumulate a 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.430
 fleshy tissue that will help 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.060
 symbiosis processes in fruits 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.070
 dried in the space between the shell 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.050
 the fruit and the seeds is not 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.660
 stuffed by nothing 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.880
 in dried seeds the fruit can 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.070
 get to open up by exposing himself 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.030
 the seeds to the wind or other factors 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.030
 abiotics that are going to disperse the seed
