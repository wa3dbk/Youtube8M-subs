00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.870 
research and realized a lot of makeup
has<00:01:32.310> toxins<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:34.880> foreign

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
has toxins in it and it's very foreign

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
has toxins in it and it's very foreign
to<00:01:35.909> our<00:01:36.090> bodies<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.479> our<00:01:36.659> bodies<00:01:36.720> can't

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
to our bodies and our bodies can't

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800 
to our bodies and our bodies can't
process<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> break<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
process it and break it down and and it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
process it and break it down and and it
stays<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.229> our<00:01:40.290> bloodstream<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.009> toxic

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
stays in our bloodstream and it's toxic

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
stays in our bloodstream and it's toxic
and<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.790> body<00:01:41.939> starts<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> attack<00:01:42.450> itself<00:01:42.840> in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and your body starts to attack itself in

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.520 
and your body starts to attack itself in
and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.770> can't<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.810> flush<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and you can't really flush it out and so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
and you can't really flush it out and so
that<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.270> we

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that was one thing that we kind of we

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.840 
that was one thing that we kind of we
learned<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.640> were<00:01:50.729> learning

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
learned about and and we were learning

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
learned about and and we were learning
more<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.020> decided<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
