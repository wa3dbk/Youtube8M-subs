00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.800 
finger
that<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.549> finger<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.060> completely<00:01:46.569> independent

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
that a finger is completely independent

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.529 
that a finger is completely independent
so<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.889> can<00:01:48.189> still<00:01:48.459> squeeze<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.060> end<00:01:49.209> of<00:01:49.359> ours

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
so you can still squeeze the end of ours

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.019 
so you can still squeeze the end of ours
very<00:01:50.200> strongly<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:51.009> then<00:01:51.459> you<00:01:51.579> will<00:01:51.700> have<00:01:51.819> no

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:52.029 
very strongly and then you will have no

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:55.199 
very strongly and then you will have no
problem<00:01:52.420> with<00:01:52.569> it<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.829> you<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> full<00:01:54.939> grip

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
problem with it so you have a full grip

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.120 
problem with it so you have a full grip
right<00:01:55.450> there<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:55.929> then<00:01:56.319> you<00:01:56.409> can<00:01:56.529> use<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.829> one

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
right there and then you can use it one

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.639 
right there and then you can use it one
finger<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.670> clutch<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.659> on<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:59.020> time<00:01:59.349> need

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
finger to clutch it so on this time need

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.559 
finger to clutch it so on this time need
to<00:01:59.829> have<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.189> little<00:02:00.429> higher<00:02:00.609> we<00:02:01.209> run<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.479> the
