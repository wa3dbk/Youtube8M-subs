 hello with you smartphone to her 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.300
 she test we have samsung galaxy grand 2 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 quad-core smartphone in a half 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
 gigabytes of ram and 8 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.130
 built-in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.010
 my big kids display and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.310
 battery for 2600 milliampere hours 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 enough face for this for price tags 350 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050
 dollars and what else is interesting new 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 see further design in style 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 popular galaxy laptop 3 only 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.869
 add gran 2 honor 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.969
 certainly not the fact that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 the manufacturer is already in the foreseeable future not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 will run like decisions on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 every third of his smartphones but on 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 this moment 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.590
 used design under the skin looks like 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.450
 perky i'm stylish and even status on 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 none of the competitors have anything 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.489
 there is no such thing at least until the car 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 case edging swept however 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.610
 somewhat different than that which is available 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 inside 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 however here it is also massive except 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 In addition, several appear above the display. 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.829
 which in turn allows 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.290
 prevent touch coating 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.630
 the latter with a table or another flat 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 surface if the user decides 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 put the smartphone front panel on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 table 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 build quality claims I have not 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 called in the editorial office we visited 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.250
 engineering version of the tube out 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 samsung representative offices in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 Kiev , however, the sample was 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.759
 perfectly folded no backlash even 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.979
 small squeaky materials 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.930
 no cover was found 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 battery pack as very 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.909
 performing the reverse procedure is quick and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.430
 convenient one action a couple of seconds not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.280
 more play between it and the body 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.350
 missing for the hand tube is comfortable though 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 for full navigation within the means 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.750
 fingers holding hands count not 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.430
 there is still a 5-25 inch display 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 automatically made the smartphone enough 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 long and wide and here even 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
 one-handed control application is small 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.189
 what can help 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.229
 however turn on the backlight off 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.240
 adjust the volume call and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.770
 perform many other functions so 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.899
 way quite real 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 front panel of the smartphone is divided 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.930
 classic large display below 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.790
 panel passes the glass gorilla glass 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.530
 second generation as in other 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.540
 galaxy smartphones in this novelty 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.940
 user can time out 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.220
 backlight touch keys last 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.500
 Valid from the submenu display all back 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 the panel covers the battery cover 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.880
 block body which is the main eye 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.400
 8 megapixel cameras as well 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.440
 LED flash plus speaker output 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.310
 speakerphone 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 looking around the right side 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 the user will find a button on it 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.430
 power on and also 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.989
 a small gap equipped here for 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.690
 so that he can remove the cover 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.160
 battery pack on the opposite 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.280
 the edge is a paired button 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.080
 adjusting the sound volume inspecting 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 top end user to see on it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.270
 classic audio jack on the bottom 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.910
 located port micro usb + miniature 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.250
 Smartphone built-in microphone 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.570
 has 5 25 inch display 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.150
 whose resolution is 720 by 1280 points in 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.450
 Based on tft matrix pixel density on 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.310
 inch 280 viewing angles significantly and how 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 vertically and horizontally 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.049
 Grit as they say not armed 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.670
 gaze not seen during 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.769
 work in bright solar conditions 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.540
 environments some extinction 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.610
 the displayed data is taking place 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.680
 although to call it critical is not 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.989
 it will turn out and the maximum level 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.690
 backlight smooths out well 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.130
 discomfort in this case 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.110
 good sensitivity maintained 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.230
 touch control by five 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.750
 fingers simultaneously declared volume 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.430
 built-in memory of 8 gigabytes though 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.780
 practice user initially 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.850
 about five available

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 supported hot swap them 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.239
 connect usb-drive fails 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.850
 the system does not provide two separate

 conversational and loud speaker 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.269
 connections 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.769
 both with good volume and purity to me 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.770
 it was quite comfortable to communicate 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.780
 via galaxy grand 2 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.330
 even in loud avenue conditions or 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.640
 by the subscriber on the other end 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.540
 wire quality hearing complaints 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.030
 did not occur 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.160
 but the possibility of speakerphone 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.290
 enough to watch the video 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.260
 or indoor games 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.340
 2600 removable battery capacity 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.290
 milliampere hours 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.690
 according to the official data of one 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.980
 full charge is enough to work in 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.650
 talk time up to 17 hours or up to 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.630
 370 hours standby in practice 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.380
 charging the device in the morning and with moderate 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140
 loads 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.240
 Namely an hour to call an hour and a half 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.250
 web surfing email 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.260
 plus about half an hour or forty minutes 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.140
 total work with the camera and viewing 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.900
 video end up by the evening percentage 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.680
 battery charge seems at around 20 25 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.960
 percent 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.110
 I'll add something else in the settings menu 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.970
 there is a proprietary setting 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.860
 energy saving running 2 grams under 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.530
 operating system android 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.780
 43 of the box surface and installed 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.850
 samsung touchwiz branded shell 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.710
 changes in comparison with the interface 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.960
 implemented previous versions 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.120
 there are no smartphones from this manufacturer 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.580
 before you test results 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.380
 performance and hardware inside 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.260
 quad polkan clock frequency 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.390
 which 1 and 2 gigahertz besides on 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.020
 board and a half gigabytes of operational 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.350
 of memory 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.180
 as well as graphics adreno 305 add that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.950
 this iron is enough for 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.000
 productive games either 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.620
 playing hd and full hd video 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.270
 smartphone galaxy grand 2 supports 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.400
 work with two sim cards 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.920
 both can be used for calls 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.210
 or data transfer 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.850
 corresponding slots are numbered and 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.840
 by the way this is the same numbering used in 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.700
 menu interface 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.640
 so that the user can choose which 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.820
 sim card call either send 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.830
 SMS message 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.150
 switching between them is available on 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.430
 notification panels 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.060
 but the settings themselves are all implemented 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.290
 priority options 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.330
 migrated to this novelty and several 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.790
 interesting features associated with the sensor 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.890
 movements 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.810
 I for example have a function which 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.410
 allows you to turn off the sound when incoming 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.750
 calling 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.360
 and pause playback 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.070
 music if the screen is off for everything 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.830
 it's enough just to turn it around 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.870
 phone front panel to the table is different 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.610
 palm control feature allows 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.220
 get a simple screenshot of the screen 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.050
 holding the panels on the edge of the arm except 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.920
 addition can be disabled or suspended 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.760
 the sounds just shut the tap 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.090
 smartphone equipped with 8 megapixel 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.560
 main camera with flash 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.840
 autofocus for both photo and 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.140
 video shooting video recording is carried out 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.730
 with maximum resolution full hd with 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.710
 text content you can 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.740
 read in our text review on 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.870
 smartphone portal yuri 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.790
 what is the ultimate galaxy buyer 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.400
 grand 2 getting not only good 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.380
 iron but also support dual sim 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.810
 there is also one of the best options 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.640
 design for today a lot 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.330
 interesting applications to work with 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.240
 gestures 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.440
 android 43 out of the box plus enough 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 good display 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.490
 even though its basis 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.140
 not a jack or plays involved 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.140
 matrix tft only
