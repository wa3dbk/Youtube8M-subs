earlier<00:03:13.190> we<00:03:13.400> used<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.790> plant<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.269> entire<00:03:14.390> gain

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
earlier we used to plant the entire gain

in<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.290> fans<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:17.840> Roshan's<00:03:18.290> machine

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
in the fans with Roshan's machine

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.640 
in the fans with Roshan's machine
we<00:03:19.220> saved<00:03:19.519> most<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.360> make<00:03:20.930> jaggery<00:03:21.380> out

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
we saved most of it and make jaggery out

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.300 
we saved most of it and make jaggery out
of<00:03:21.950> it

of it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.449 
of it
hence<00:03:22.820> we<00:03:23.180> make<00:03:23.360> double<00:03:23.720> profits<00:03:24.110> by<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:25.190> cost

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
hence we make double profits by the cost

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.580 
hence we make double profits by the cost
of<00:03:25.640> sugarcane<00:03:26.060> seed<00:03:26.390> planting<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.019> very<00:03:27.320> high

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
of sugarcane seed planting is very high

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.100 
of sugarcane seed planting is very high
with<00:03:28.489> this<00:03:28.640> machine<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.510> costs<00:03:29.900> come<00:03:30.080> down

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
with this machine the costs come down

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.370 
with this machine the costs come down
dramatically<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.519> almost<00:03:31.970> 2%<00:03:32.360> Superferry

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
dramatically to almost 2% Superferry

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.229 
dramatically to almost 2% Superferry
hence<00:03:33.680> farmers<00:03:34.160> have<00:03:34.310> realized<00:03:34.760> how<00:03:35.000> good

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
hence farmers have realized how good

hence farmers have realized how good
