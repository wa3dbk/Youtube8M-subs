 Depending on how you will pump but 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 now let's actually consider 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.720
 we like a toy duel going on here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.200
 a little slow down on the record for what 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.110
 I apologize, but in general she goes without 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.610
 problems look childhood is a duel 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.439
 puddles so skip screensaver 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.070
 he is a bright Jedi and wins from the explosion 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.470
 too, the resistance of the array dies 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.869

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.290
 what will we do against our enemies 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 here are two Sith costs and we can 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 throw a grenade at them can give 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 command our character to attack me 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.740

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.439
 improved performance characteristics 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.989
