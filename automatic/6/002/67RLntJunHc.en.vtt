hello<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.549> will<00:00:05.940> try<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.589> make

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hello I will try to show you how to make

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.169 
hello I will try to show you how to make
this<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:12.950> once<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> do<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> it's

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this one once you know how to do it it's

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:29.689 
this one once you know how to do it it's
really<00:00:16.109> easy<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:26.060> I<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:28.310> three<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.519> these

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
really easy so I have three of these

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:42.590 
really easy so I have three of these
pieces<00:00:36.500> three<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.800> yellow<00:00:38.250> ones<00:00:41.600> then

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
pieces three of these yellow ones then

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.240 
pieces three of these yellow ones then
you<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:44.870> three<00:00:45.870> pieces<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:52.250> then

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you will use three pieces like this then

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
you will use three pieces like this then
again<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.940> use<00:00:54.110> second<00:00:55.110> step<00:00:57.050> three

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
again you will use second step three

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.889 
again you will use second step three
pieces<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.649> this<00:01:01.309> join<00:01:02.309> together<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.000> then

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
pieces like this join together and then

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.109 
pieces like this join together and then
the<00:01:04.019> last<00:01:04.199> step<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> put<00:01:05.960> these<00:01:06.960> three<00:01:07.350> ones

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
the last step is to put these three ones

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
the last step is to put these three ones
there<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.380> special

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
there they have a little bit special

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.719 
there they have a little bit special
shape<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:14.040> put<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.490> three<00:01:14.820> ones<00:01:15.030> together

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
shape to put these three ones together

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.499 
shape to put these three ones together
this<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> last<00:01:18.390> part<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.090> start

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
this will be the last part so we start

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
this will be the last part so we start
to<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:23.119> these<00:01:24.119> three<00:01:24.390> pieces<00:01:24.600> together<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:26.360> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to put these three pieces together as a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
to put these three pieces together as a
sort<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.140> triangle<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.659> piece<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
sort of triangle you put one piece the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.780 
sort of triangle you put one piece the
other<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> other<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:55.429 

and<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.939> looks<00:01:44.180> like<00:01:44.299> this<00:01:47.049> join<00:01:48.049> together

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.950 

can<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> take<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.909> three<00:01:57.179> yellow<00:01:57.420> pieces

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
can you take the three yellow pieces

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
can you take the three yellow pieces
those<00:01:58.950> ones<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.929> will<00:02:01.109> put<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.679> on<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
those ones and you will put them on the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.559 
those ones and you will put them on the
sides<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.329> this

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:21.140 

so<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.650> looks<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:14.170> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.030 

then<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.299> third<00:02:22.569> part<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:23.939> to<00:02:24.939> put<00:02:26.040> those

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
then the third part is to put those

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.830 
then the third part is to put those
pieces<00:02:27.430> those<00:02:28.000> three<00:02:28.299> pieces<00:02:28.859> on<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.280> sides

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
pieces those three pieces on the sides

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.459 
pieces those three pieces on the sides
on<00:02:31.840> each<00:02:32.019> side<00:02:32.379> one<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:35.049> best<00:02:35.260> thing<00:02:35.439> to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
on each side one and the best thing to

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.880 
on each side one and the best thing to
do<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.280> hold<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.540> three<00:02:38.260> yellow<00:02:38.500> pieces

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
do is to hold the three yellow pieces

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.890 
do is to hold the three yellow pieces
together<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:40.299> one<00:02:40.510> hand<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.409> so<00:02:42.900> you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
together with one hand like this so you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.509 
together with one hand like this so you
put<00:02:44.200> one<00:02:44.439> on<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:45.430> side<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:50.230> second<00:02:50.739> one<00:02:50.920> you

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
put one on this side the second one you

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:59.069 
put one on this side the second one you
put<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:51.939> this<00:02:52.510> side<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:58.450> third<00:02:58.689> one<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.049> a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
put on this side and the third one is a

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.080 
put on this side and the third one is a
little<00:02:59.349> bit<00:02:59.439> harder<00:02:59.859> because<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.609> really

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
little bit harder because you really

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.000 
little bit harder because you really
have<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.359> squeeze<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.169> and<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:04.090> do<00:03:04.299> that<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
have to squeeze it in and to do that you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.259 
have to squeeze it in and to do that you
will<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:09.299> turn<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.659> like<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:12.400> put<00:03:12.849> this

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
will have to turn in like you put this

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.159 
will have to turn in like you put this
part<00:03:13.659> there<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.099> turn<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:19.169> it's

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
part there and then you turn it it's

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.119 
part there and then you turn it it's
like<00:03:20.470> because<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.639> do<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.299> way<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:23.680> it

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
like because if you do it this way as it

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.869 
like because if you do it this way as it
should<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:25.269> should<00:03:25.449> enter<00:03:26.010> no<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.489> doesn't

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
should as it should enter no it doesn't

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.089 
should as it should enter no it doesn't
don't<00:03:28.329> enter<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:30.370> turn<00:03:30.729> it<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> little<00:03:31.239> bit

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
don't enter so you turn it a little bit

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.830 
don't enter so you turn it a little bit
while<00:03:33.099> holding<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.909> part<00:03:34.239> with<00:03:34.359> your<00:03:34.510> hand

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
while holding this part with your hand

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.009 
while holding this part with your hand
and<00:03:35.079> then<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:36.269> push<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.299> in<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:37.840> then<00:03:37.900> you

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and then you push it in and then you

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:50.229 
and then you push it in and then you
turn

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.319 

it's<00:03:50.629> really<00:03:50.900> important<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.829> try<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.849> hold

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
it's really important to try to hold

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:04.229 
it's really important to try to hold
those<00:03:53.599> three<00:03:54.049> yellow<00:03:55.359> sticks<00:03:56.359> here<00:03:56.750> together

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:15.390 

like<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.359> we<00:04:08.420> have<00:04:08.689> this

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.550 

and<00:04:15.849> then<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> last<00:04:16.449> part<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.320> most

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
and then the last part is the most

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.969 
and then the last part is the most
difficult<00:04:18.040> part

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.999 

you<00:04:23.979> have<00:04:24.129> this<00:04:24.340> tree<00:04:25.259> sticks<00:04:26.259> with<00:04:26.499> a<00:04:26.530> special

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
you have this tree sticks with a special

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.450 
you have this tree sticks with a special
shape<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:28.449> put<00:04:28.930> them<00:04:29.139> together<00:04:29.349> in<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.189> same

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
shape you put them together in the same

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.659 
shape you put them together in the same
way<00:04:30.729> as<00:04:30.999> you<00:04:31.300> put<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:32.349> first<00:04:32.740> tree<00:04:33.219> together

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
way as you put the first tree together

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:48.200 
way as you put the first tree together
like<00:04:34.419> that<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:41.999> you<00:04:42.999> make<00:04:43.210> sure<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.870> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.129 

this<00:04:49.210> shape<00:04:49.599> is<00:04:49.900> on<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.499> outside<00:04:51.749> so<00:04:52.749> you<00:04:52.810> put

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
this shape is on the outside so you put

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.300 
this shape is on the outside so you put
this<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:54.069> special<00:04:54.550> shape<00:04:54.849> on<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.210> outside<00:04:56.310> so

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
this the special shape on the outside so

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.140 
this the special shape on the outside so
this<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:57.759> facing<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.539> outside<00:04:59.699> the<00:05:00.699> same<00:05:00.969> with

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
this is facing the outside the same with

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:10.379 
this is facing the outside the same with
this<00:05:01.300> part<00:05:05.729> outside<00:05:06.729> and<00:05:07.629> the<00:05:07.750> third<00:05:07.990> part<00:05:09.389> you

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
this part outside and the third part you

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:18.090 
this part outside and the third part you
have<00:05:10.509> to<00:05:10.569> make<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:11.289> part<00:05:11.650> face<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.340> outside

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.670 

so<00:05:18.610> then<00:05:19.270> we<00:05:19.480> have<00:05:21.990> when<00:05:22.990> we<00:05:23.110> have<00:05:23.140> something

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
so then we have when we have something

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.170 
so then we have when we have something
like<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:27.310> have<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.550> squeeze<00:05:28.000> them

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
like that you have to squeeze them

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.330 
like that you have to squeeze them
together<00:05:28.360> like<00:05:29.170> this

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.640 

so<00:05:34.970> you<00:05:35.060> take<00:05:35.270> them<00:05:35.450> together<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:36.320> try<00:05:36.590> to

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
so you take them together and try to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.880 
so you take them together and try to
take<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.280> with<00:05:37.430> one<00:05:37.460> hand<00:05:38.950> like<00:05:39.950> this<00:05:41.680> in<00:05:42.680> one

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
take it with one hand like this in one

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.820 
take it with one hand like this in one
hand<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.550> then<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.510> have<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:44.900> put<00:05:45.650> it<00:05:45.800> here

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
hand and then you have to put it here

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.670 
hand and then you have to put it here
all<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.790> three<00:05:46.970> together<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:48.320> have<00:05:48.500> to

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
all the three together you have to

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.700 
all the three together you have to
really<00:05:49.120> squeeze<00:05:50.120> it<00:05:50.360> in<00:05:50.540> there<00:05:50.840> on<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.500> top

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
really squeeze it in there on the top

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.840 
really squeeze it in there on the top
and<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:53.420> best<00:05:53.660> way<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:53.900> do<00:05:54.230> that<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.920> to

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
and the best way to do that is to to

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.580 
and the best way to do that is to to
start<00:05:56.510> with<00:05:56.720> one<00:05:56.960> part<00:05:58.810> then<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.960> second<00:06:00.350> part

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
start with one part then the second part

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.400 
start with one part then the second part
and<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:00.920> third<00:06:01.490> part<00:06:01.760> normally<00:06:02.600> will<00:06:02.780> we'll

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
and the third part normally will we'll

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.770 
and the third part normally will we'll
get<00:06:04.280> in<00:06:04.460> there<00:06:04.640> automatically<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.660> you

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
get in there automatically and you

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.970 
get in there automatically and you
really<00:06:06.140> once<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:06.950> have<00:06:07.100> two<00:06:07.370> parts<00:06:07.790> in<00:06:08.000> there

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
really once you have two parts in there

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.580 
really once you have two parts in there
you<00:06:09.980> just<00:06:10.430> have<00:06:10.610> to<00:06:10.760> push<00:06:11.030> so<00:06:11.720> you<00:06:11.780> push<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.320> top

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
you just have to push so you push on top

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.390 
you just have to push so you push on top
and<00:06:12.830> it<00:06:12.920> will<00:06:13.240> it<00:06:14.240> will<00:06:14.420> enter<00:06:14.920> so<00:06:15.920> I<00:06:15.950> will<00:06:16.190> try

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
and it will it will enter so I will try

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.020 
and it will it will enter so I will try
to<00:06:16.430> show<00:06:16.790> you<00:06:19.660> so<00:06:20.660> this<00:06:20.870> part<00:06:21.200> I<00:06:21.640> will<00:06:22.640> put<00:06:22.820> on

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
to show you so this part I will put on

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:30.970 
to show you so this part I will put on
top<00:06:23.090> there<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:27.440> to<00:06:27.830> do<00:06:27.980> that<00:06:29.350> you<00:06:30.350> just<00:06:30.650> do<00:06:30.860> it

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
top there and to do that you just do it

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.300 
top there and to do that you just do it
in<00:06:31.130> in<00:06:31.370> a<00:06:32.000> in<00:06:32.660> three<00:06:33.470> different<00:06:33.680> parts<00:06:34.250> so

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
in in a in three different parts so

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.500 
in in a in three different parts so
first<00:06:35.300> part<00:06:35.660> is<00:06:36.170> this<00:06:36.350> one<00:06:38.920> one<00:06:39.920> and<00:06:40.670> you<00:06:41.240> turn

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
first part is this one one and you turn

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:48.010 
first part is this one one and you turn
it<00:06:41.720> you<00:06:41.900> try<00:06:42.470> to<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:44.030> second<00:06:44.390> part<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:47.020> second

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
it you try to the second part the second

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.690 
it you try to the second part the second
part<00:06:48.050> and<00:06:48.530> then<00:06:49.400> it's<00:06:49.730> done<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:51.080> third<00:06:51.350> part

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
part and then it's done the third part

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.020 
part and then it's done the third part
clicks<00:06:52.700> in<00:06:52.880> automatically<00:06:53.480> you<00:06:53.780> just<00:06:54.730> push<00:06:55.730> on

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
clicks in automatically you just push on

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:03.460 
clicks in automatically you just push on
the<00:06:56.300> top<00:06:57.310> and<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:59.510> fits<00:06:59.750> in<00:06:59.990> like<00:07:00.500> this<00:07:02.200> and<00:07:03.200> so

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
the top and it fits in like this and so

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.830 
the top and it fits in like this and so
it's<00:07:03.650> done
