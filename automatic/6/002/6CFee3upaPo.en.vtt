this Army Ranger loadout I didn't know
whether<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.410> scar-h<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.489> the

whether to use the scar-h as the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
whether to use the scar-h as the
selected<00:00:48.420> weapon<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.930> loadout<00:00:49.289> soon<00:00:49.590> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
selected weapon for this loadout soon as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
selected weapon for this loadout soon as
the<00:00:49.980> sky<00:00:50.579> h<00:00:50.760> has<00:00:51.030> been<00:00:51.300> used<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.899> Army

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.139 
the sky h has been used by the Army
Rangers<00:00:52.649> although<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> didn't<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.879> very

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
Rangers although it didn't see very

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
Rangers although it didn't see very
widespread<00:00:54.420> deployment<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> thought<00:00:56.430> I'd

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
widespread deployment so I thought I'd

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
widespread deployment so I thought I'd
just<00:00:56.670> stick<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> m4<00:00:57.420> once<00:00:57.660> again<00:00:57.960> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
just stick with the m4 once again with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
just stick with the m4 once again with
it<00:00:58.500> being<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> most<00:00:58.800> recognizable<00:00:59.730> weapons

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it being the most recognizable weapons

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
used by the Army Rangers the attachment

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
used by the Army Rangers the attachment
configuration<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> also<00:01:04.049> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.350> very

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
configuration is also going to be very

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100
