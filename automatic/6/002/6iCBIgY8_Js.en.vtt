video number two on the pioneer we go
here<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.350> there<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.740> hardware<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.940> up

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
here it is there is hardware and up

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.799 
here it is there is hardware and up
there<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:11.099> laptop<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> software<00:00:12.389> the

hardware<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.859> itself<00:00:17.250> you'll<00:00:17.430> notice

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
hardware the we go itself you'll notice

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
hardware the we go itself you'll notice
that's<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.029> rather<00:00:18.210> nice<00:00:18.449> green<00:00:18.990> color<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:20.070> does

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that's a rather nice green color it does

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.660 
that's a rather nice green color it does
come<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.300> sorts<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> colors<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.490> by<00:00:23.490> all

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
come in all sorts of colors so by all

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.429 
come in all sorts of colors so by all
means<00:00:23.880> go<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.390> check<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.720> getting<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> mixed

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
means go and check out getting a mixed

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.950 
means go and check out getting a mixed
stock<00:00:25.619> code<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:25.920> UK<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
stock code at UK go and have a look and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
stock code at UK go and have a look and
you<00:00:28.320> never<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.680> they<00:00:29.070> could<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> color

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

also you can press down on it what we're

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.729 
also you can press down on it what we're
going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.420> now<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
going to do now is have a look at this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to do now is have a look at this
software<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.909> moving<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> dial<00:01:06.750> around

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
software now I'm moving the dial around

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
software now I'm moving the dial around
and<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.880> move<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and as if you can see as I move it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
and as if you can see as I move it
around<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.229> 1/8<00:01:10.590> 1/4<00:01:11.600> 1/2<00:01:12.600> 1<00:01:13.380> 2<00:01:14.100> 4<00:01:15.090> 8<00:01:15.710> 16

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
around we go from 1/8 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 16

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.020 
around we go from 1/8 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 16

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and 32 now they're actually beats so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
and 32 now they're actually beats so
that's<00:01:21.210> 32<00:01:21.840> beats<00:01:22.400> 16<00:01:23.400> 8<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.840> 2<00:01:24.990> bars<00:01:25.470> 4

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that's 32 beats 16 8 which is 2 bars 4

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
that's 32 beats 16 8 which is 2 bars 4
which<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.490> 1<00:01:26.790> bar<00:01:27.060> we've<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.909> 1/2<00:01:29.909> quarter

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
which is 1 bar we've got to 1/2 quarter

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
which is 1 bar we've got to 1/2 quarter
and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.290> eighth<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.130> I'll<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then eighth so what I'll do now is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.160 
and then eighth so what I'll do now is
I'm<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> press<00:01:33.869> play<00:01:34.490> get<00:01:35.490> rid<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
I'm going to press play get rid of that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm going to press play get rid of that
I'm<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.070> move<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.729> dial<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.869> 4<00:01:40.259> which

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I'm going to move this dial to 4 which

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
I'm going to move this dial to 4 which
is<00:01:40.680> 1<00:01:41.040> bar<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> press<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.079> the

is 1 bar I'm going to press down on the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.020 
is 1 bar I'm going to press down on the
dial

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.080 

now<00:01:46.930> what's<00:01:47.170> happened<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:48.160> by<00:01:48.490> me<00:01:48.670> pressing

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
now what's happened is by me pressing

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.060 
now what's happened is by me pressing
down<00:01:49.390> you're<00:01:50.050> having<00:01:50.290> number<00:01:50.560> four<00:01:50.830> there

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
down you're having number four there

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.750 
down you're having number four there
that's<00:01:51.550> made<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:51.910> software<00:01:52.360> loop<00:01:52.840> 1<00:01:53.350> bar<00:01:53.650> if<00:01:54.550> I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
that's made the software loop 1 bar if I

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.550 
that's made the software loop 1 bar if I
want<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.330> with<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:57.220> loop<00:01:57.850> engaged<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:59.020> can<00:01:59.380> now

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
want to with the loop engaged I can now

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.190 
want to with the loop engaged I can now
move<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.160> dial<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:01.180> I<00:02:01.330> can<00:02:01.540> change<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.050> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
move that dial and I can change that to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.650 
move that dial and I can change that to
two<00:02:02.380> beats<00:02:02.590> one<00:02:03.520> beat<00:02:03.790> 1/2<00:02:05.490> Porter<00:02:06.490> 8<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.420> so

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
two beats one beat 1/2 Porter 8 and so

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.900 
two beats one beat 1/2 Porter 8 and so
on<00:02:07.690> or<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:08.979> make<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.369> loop<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.610> lot<00:02:09.759> longer

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
on or I can make the loop a lot longer

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.900 
on or I can make the loop a lot longer
as<00:02:10.240> well<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.650> want<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.920> get<00:02:12.010> out<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> loop

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
as well if I want to get out of the loop

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.800 
as well if I want to get out of the loop
all<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> need<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.320> press<00:02:14.740> down<00:02:15.000> again<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
all I need to do is press down again and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.420 
all I need to do is press down again and
there<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.080> go<00:02:17.230> we're<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.770> loop<00:02:17.950> now

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
there you go we're out of the loop now

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.729 
there you go we're out of the loop now
if<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.850> look<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> software<00:02:19.540> again

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.160 

with<00:02:23.739> Virtual<00:02:24.160> DJ<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.239> mixer<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.989> have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
with Virtual DJ we have mixer we have

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.070 
with Virtual DJ we have mixer we have
video<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.530> scratch<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.600> go<00:02:28.810> over<00:02:28.840> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
video and scratch so if I go over to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.600 
video and scratch so if I go over to
scratch<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> different<00:02:31.690> readout<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
scratch we get a different readout and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.020 
scratch we get a different readout and
now<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:33.850> can<00:02:34.150> use<00:02:34.800> any<00:02:35.800> track<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.820> or

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
now we can use any track we want to or

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.840 
now we can use any track we want to or
any<00:02:37.300> sample<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.709> you've<00:02:38.920> maybe<00:02:39.370> already

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
any sample that you've maybe already

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.540 
any sample that you've maybe already
recorded<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.709> use<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.370> virtual

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
recorded and you can use the virtual

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.010 
recorded and you can use the virtual
Placidus<00:02:43.450> much<00:02:44.520> exactly<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.730> same<00:02:45.850> as<00:02:46.330> let's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
Placidus much exactly the same as let's

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.199 
Placidus much exactly the same as let's
say<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> scratch<00:02:47.560> turntablist<00:02:48.190> would<00:02:48.550> do<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:48.910> an

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
say a scratch turntablist would do or an

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.430 
say a scratch turntablist would do or an
old-school<00:02:49.690> DJ<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.380> real<00:02:50.620> vinyl<00:02:51.040> turntables

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
old-school DJ with real vinyl turntables

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.410 
old-school DJ with real vinyl turntables
now<00:02:53.440> also<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.920> guy<00:02:54.130> here<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.850> do<00:02:55.060> video

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
now also this guy here you can do video

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.229 
now also this guy here you can do video
mixing<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.830> if<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.310> want<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.640> do<00:02:57.760> proper

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
mixing but if you want to do proper

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.509 
mixing but if you want to do proper
video<00:02:58.450> mixing<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.200> big<00:02:59.440> screens<00:02:59.860> you

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
video mixing and have big screens you

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.270 
video mixing and have big screens you
will<00:03:00.820> need<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.450> upgrade<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.680> Virtual<00:03:03.100> DJ

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
will need to upgrade the Virtual DJ

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.940 
will need to upgrade the Virtual DJ
software<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.900> go<00:03:05.049> back<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.500> mixer

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
software so if we go back to the mixer

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.539 
software so if we go back to the mixer
now<00:03:06.850> you'll<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.480> we<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.110> 1<00:03:08.560> &amp;<00:03:09.070> 2<00:03:09.280> turntables

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
now you'll see we have 1 &amp; 2 turntables

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.479 
now you'll see we have 1 &amp; 2 turntables
but<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> look<00:03:10.959> at<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.110> hardware<00:03:11.620> we've

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
but if you look at the hardware we've

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.600 
but if you look at the hardware we've
got<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:13.000> two<00:03:13.420> buttons<00:03:13.720> deck<00:03:14.200> C<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.920> depth<00:03:15.400> D

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
got here two buttons deck C and depth D

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.199 
got here two buttons deck C and depth D
so<00:03:16.329> at<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> moment<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.079> I've<00:03:17.620> got<00:03:18.060> depth<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
so at the moment now I've got depth a

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.819 
so at the moment now I've got depth a
playing<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:19.989> track<00:03:21.390> bring<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> volume<00:03:22.630> down

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
press C on the on the hardware and now

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.120 
press C on the on the hardware and now
we're<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> completely<00:03:28.720> new<00:03:28.900> deck<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:30.100> you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
we're on to a completely new deck so you

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.539 
we're on to a completely new deck so you
can<00:03:30.700> do<00:03:31.269> for<00:03:31.840> deck<00:03:32.230> mixing<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:32.950> want<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> if

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
can do for deck mixing if you want to if

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.340 
can do for deck mixing if you want to if
you're<00:03:34.180> gonna<00:03:34.360> do<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.690> likes<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.959> for<00:03:35.170> deck

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
you're gonna do the likes of for deck

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.319 
you're gonna do the likes of for deck
mixing<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.549> want<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.970> all<00:03:37.150> in

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
mixing and you want to get it all in

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.140 
mixing and you want to get it all in
time<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:38.260> probably<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.680> very<00:03:38.980> good<00:03:39.100> idea<00:03:39.280> to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
time it's probably a very good idea to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.330 
time it's probably a very good idea to
make<00:03:40.360> sure<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.690> use<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.079> sync<00:03:41.560> functionality

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
make sure you use the sync functionality

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.740 
make sure you use the sync functionality
of<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.610> right<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.269> we<00:03:43.360> all<00:03:43.450> look<00:03:43.600> at<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
of it right if we all look at the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.430 
of it right if we all look at the
hardware

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
hardware

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.410 
hardware
we've<00:03:45.130> got<00:03:45.310> crossfade<00:03:45.880> here<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:46.209> can<00:03:46.390> use

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
we've got crossfade here we can use

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.870 
we've got crossfade here we can use
through<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.130> use<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> middle<00:03:48.640> icon

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
through we can use the middle icon

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.300 
through we can use the middle icon
that's<00:03:49.540> really<00:03:50.049> good<00:03:50.260> for<00:03:50.440> someone<00:03:50.980> who<00:03:51.070> likes

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
that's really good for someone who likes

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.940 
that's really good for someone who likes
to<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.610> beat<00:03:52.000> beat<00:03:52.510> matching<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.140> smooth

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950
