00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 cinnamon the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.460
 never, obviously, everyone does 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.860
 your predictions there are favorites we have 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.630
 partners here in the state they bring 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 the doctor's shirt all week 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 to see if so they went to the village of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.920
 guadalupe everyone makes his efforts 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 we will be clear amateur to you what you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 It seems that at the moment it is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 as the favorite is difficult I think it is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
 almost a flown to say who is the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 favorite because he sees both very well 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 equipment but thinking about the pairings that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 I see the final pablo I would opt for 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.690
 america because because it has the best 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.340
 final player who is christian 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
 benitez and I want that in a final that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.270
 could be closed I do not know if as to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 few goals but closed in terms of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 global score having this player 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 that at any moment you can notice 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.010
 goal has a pass in the league 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 I think that makes me go a little bit 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 more with America but honestly I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.270
 I really like the final because both 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.610
 teams have sufficient arguments 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.949
 to come out champions I think different 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 of your marked because I think that the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.079
 blue cross team has shown in the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.750
 last three months be the best 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 Mexican soccer the most balanced the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740
 arrival after 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 It's Pablo PavÃ³n's own barrier 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.240
 chaco intona lush 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.640
 and that has generated that this team 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 look healthier stronger and good then 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 everything can happen but what is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.090
 interesting is that we do not remember a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 where we could not talk to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 forcefulness of a broad favorite is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 very balanced and good also you have to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.509
 take into account the imponderables 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.580
 bad arbitrations the bad decisions of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.710
 arbitrators may harm 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.960
 our equipment especially when starting 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.970
 the matches and also do not lose 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.649
 of sight some errors that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.729
 usually in those matches of so much 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.979
 pressure are recurrent that we will be 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 I also say I think it could appear and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.940
 you will finish imposing talk Pablo the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.979
 weather has started to rain in these 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.539
 last days in a federal garden and I 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.940
 He remembers that we saw the end of 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.860
 images the first leg went through a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.360
 downpour and no mistake is important to the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 time that the game of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.119
 gone if the sky fell that city of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.649
 mexico felt floods is to say this 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.940
 factor that emission is very important 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.460
 because usually here it rains in the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.130
 late or night and it could be dry 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.080
 and change the course of the match to see what 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.890
 it happens but as I said it happens very even 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.990
 and I think it's a great final
