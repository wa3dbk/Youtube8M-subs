actually 147 grain and these are what

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.139 
actually 147 grain and these are what
they<00:01:52.560> call<00:01:52.590> flat<00:01:53.009> nose<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:53.970> there

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
they call flat nose as you can see there

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.929 
they call flat nose as you can see there
it's<00:01:54.329> flat<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.960> round<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.939> those

as<00:04:24.610> with<00:04:25.390> something<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.530> might

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
as with something like this you might

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.400 
as with something like this you might
only<00:04:26.920> need<00:04:27.040> most<00:04:27.910> likely<00:04:28.240> put<00:04:28.420> one<00:04:28.900> shot<00:04:29.140> and

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
only need most likely put one shot and

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.100 
only need most likely put one shot and
you<00:04:29.710> know<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:31.030> their<00:04:31.210> torso<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.900> and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
you know and in their torso and and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.730 
you know and in their torso and and
that's<00:04:32.320> it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
that's it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.450 
that's it
so<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.240> necessary<00:04:34.960> no<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.920> it's<00:04:39.160> it's

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
so is it necessary no but it's it's it's

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.140 
so is it necessary no but it's it's it's
recommended<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:41.410> course<00:04:41.850> for<00:04:42.850> those<00:04:42.970> who

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
don't know and then and of course those

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.250 
don't know and then and of course those
who<00:04:44.890> do<00:04:45.490> know<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:46.570> are<00:04:46.690> going<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.870> spend<00:04:47.110> more

who do know you are going to spend more
money<00:04:47.320> for<00:04:47.860> them<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:49.390> know<00:04:49.480> both<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.930> these

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
money for them you know both of these

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.420 
money for them you know both of these
you're<00:04:50.530> either<00:04:50.620> going<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> get<00:04:51.010> twenty<00:04:51.340> or

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
you're either going to get twenty or

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.390 
you're either going to get twenty or
twenty<00:04:51.700> five<00:04:51.730> rounds<00:04:52.510> for<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.650> type<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:54.040> ammo

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
twenty five rounds for this type of ammo

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.370 
twenty five rounds for this type of ammo
for<00:04:55.530> over<00:04:56.580> anywhere<00:04:57.580> between<00:04:57.760> twenty<00:04:58.270> to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
for over anywhere between twenty to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.260 
for over anywhere between twenty to
twenty-five<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.770> now<00:04:59.890> it's<00:05:00.820> probably<00:05:00.970> up

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
twenty-five and now it's probably up

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.000 
twenty-five and now it's probably up
into<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.630> thirty<00:05:01.870> dollar<00:05:02.080> range

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
into the thirty dollar range

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.210 
into the thirty dollar range
so<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.790> are<00:05:03.880> going<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.090> spend<00:05:04.270> more<00:05:04.480> for<00:05:04.540> it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
so you are going to spend more for it

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.150 
so you are going to spend more for it
but<00:05:06.220> it's<00:05:06.370> uh<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:07.320> say<00:05:08.320> it's<00:05:08.500> it's<00:05:08.800> worth<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
but it's uh I say it's it's worth the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.650 
but it's uh I say it's it's worth the
money<00:05:09.340> if<00:05:09.640> that's<00:05:09.850> what<00:05:10.030> you're<00:05:10.330> going<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.510> be

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
money if that's what you're going to be
