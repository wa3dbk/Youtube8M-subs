00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 the am I are all those publications 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 that are aimed at a female audience 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 teenager with what we can 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 find with settings of everything 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.820
 type but that in most within the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.440
 genre of romance especially this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 list has cost me enough to do it for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 the large number of series that there are about 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.199
 the genre and not only that but also 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.270
 they are all very good quality series 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.500
 so to classify them has 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.210
 had to guide as usual 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.699
 for what a different series does 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 and what will make you remember it with 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 the time and still as with the others 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.329
 I will make a separate video where it covers 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 recommended series these are the 10 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.760
 best love series 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 at number 10 we started the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.540
 list with cobat or the clan group has 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.250
 achieved by working continuously 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.590
 bring us series like the eternally 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.570
 remembered card captor sakura between 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.000
 many others that we will also see in this 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
 list but in this case we focus on 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.840
 the anime cobat or series of 24 chapters 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.570
 that tells us about a mysterious girl 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.180
 kanato cobat or who comes to the world of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.710
 humans with the mission to collect 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.260
 Heart pieces to meet your 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.729
 desire in one of your attempts comes to the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.149
 daycare as a guide where you meet 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.560
 sayaka okiura and whose case fujimoto si 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.660
 you know in advance the work of the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280
 slave without thinking twice is 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.740
 unanimously that you will love it and being 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.350
 a few 24 chapters those that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.330
 you will finish before you realize 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.979
 on the other hand if you 're not a big fan and this 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's the first anime you know about them 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 you should give it a try 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 in position number 9 we have there but 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.080
 say is a classic inside the eyes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 a series that surely the majority already 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.009
 you will have seen it in this case we have a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 anime that date of 2000 what 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 means that the quality of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.899
 that time the good thing is that being 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 talking about a series what what 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.470
 important are the parts of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 romance is not a bad thing though that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 this particular series has some 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.080
 moments of action given by the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.789
 protagonist there is who happens to be the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.890
 reincarnation of a supreme maiden 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.110
 celestial that when transformed wins 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.300
 multiple powers that the fact that the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.270
 series can be seen old is not a 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.429
 excuse not to see the position number 8 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.289
 we find hobbits here we have 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.110
 another production of the clan as I said to the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.819
 Hobbit principle stands out for the premise 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.039
 that the boy in this case I have to 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 fell in love with a computer that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.690
 you can guess inside the series 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.920
 They have all forms of girl hobbits is 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.810
 mainly a romantic comedy 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.260
 but that also raises more issues 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.689
 depth of background 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.430
 at number 7 we have now in 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.110
 high school host club 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.970
 maybe it's because of the simple carefree 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 which is the series accompanied by a drawing 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.530
 so it's me who makes this series 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 brilliant the argument tells us with a 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.470
 uji gear after breaking a vase 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.599
 very expensive one of the most clubs 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.700
 prestigious forces him to stay for 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.920
 pay the debt the grace in this series 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.870
 it resides in that in principle nobody is given 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.819
 realize that haruki is a girl and yet 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 after discovering it they decide to continue 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.130
 with the lie to attract more 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.960
 customers 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.910
 place number 6 we have the special 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.470
 in this anime we will find a 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.850
 romantic comedy that is formed from 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.650
 that the protagonist always wants 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.360
 beat your opponent and how is it 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.980
 expect from this rivalry the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.200
 feelings that are told in the anime 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.400
 the name of the anime is given by the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 special class that there is in the school 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.500
 hank use k actions in this school 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.760
 are divided from a to f which 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 they have the two best grades 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.260
 within the range of the a are hikari 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 our protagonist who is the second and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.720
 kate here sima the first 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.520
 at number 5 we have a lovely 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.050
 complex as in most series that 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.460
 we are on this list 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.920
 lovely complex consists of 24 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.480
 episodes this anime I do not think that it 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.190
 come again to no one because of more 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.630
 to put it and recommend it to all 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.880
 those that for some reason do not 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.800
 They knew the story revolves around 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.120
 koizumi a girl of 1 meter seventy and 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.740
 two daughter of susy a boy of 156 although 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.270
 at the beginning this couple got along 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.459
 for the graces his teacher did 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.740
 they will end up helping each other to 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.540
 to be able to find a partner thanks to this 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.860
 they will start to get along better and to 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.290
 realize that they have many things in 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.220
 common and obstacles that will have to 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.680
 overcome 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.810
 in position number 4 we have there 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.730
 they capture here and it has a very 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.040
 funny and curious talking about the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.360
 relationship of two students if I know very 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.190
 well that if we look only the point 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.500
 above this could not fail to be a 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.870
 heap series another is me with loves 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.520
 of school but the difference the great 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.930
 difference in this case is that the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.850
 story continues once they finish 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.799
 together and the evolution is appreciated 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.510
 protagonist has a personality that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.430
 many people will not like it 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.320
 but kotoko has a way of being and of 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.750
 act that goes out of the standard and by 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.210
 so entertaining to see where 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.220
 can finish the oic and yet not 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.980
 we can point out nothing is the typical guy 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.320
 ready that ignores the girl but 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.230
 how it will not end up falling in love with her 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.330
 in position number 3 we have a worshiper 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.280
 It is distinguished from other series by its 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.440
 well-defined characters as much as 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.730
 we will see in the following positions each 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.160
 one has his own emotions 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.500
 Defined clear motivations and very 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.820
 charismatic as I say what he does 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.560
 different to this series is all the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.360
 sentimental display of the characters 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.700
 creating us the question whether happiness 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.919
 who you love can become your 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.820
 own unanimous happiness that really 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.340
 It can make you 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.830
 It is sometimes recommended for everything 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.740
 the world in position number 2 we 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.810
 We find Kate White Sama is not the 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.580
 typical story is me and you will not see the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.160
 typical little popular girl who falls in love 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.000
 the most handsome guy in the institute 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.700
 it seems that the series is 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.560
 thought to do it just the other way around 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.360
 starting in this series will be the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.790
 boy sui who will go after the girl 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.040
 at the beginning as a hobby but 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.540
 then he will fall in love little by little 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.430
 we will find in an institute where the 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.990
 Most students are boys and 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.270
 where girls are the minority and so 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.440
 they are so scared and here it is 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.180
 when we meet the protagonist 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.160
 Misaki President of the Board of 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.810
 students a determined girl that what 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.550
 which aims to change the school 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.740
 protecting girls and reforming 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.210
 the boys and of course thanks to the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.470
 boy I use and you will have many 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.750
 comedy situations that the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.100
 you end up remembering eventually a 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.550
 perfect contrast that does not stop 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.960
 serious situations without a dose of comedy 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.570
 and finally at number one 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.550
 we can see ghana jolie tango that 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.730
 you want me to tell you this anime came out in 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.320
 its anime format in 1996 and we are facing 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.240
 one of the best eights that have been 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.400
 taken a story 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.780
 in each chapter if we said in the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.669
 placed number 2 that the girl was the 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.099
 typical protagonist here we what 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.410
 we will find again it is more than water 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.150
 calls me a lot of this series because 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.310
 even the male character is 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.530
 they seem so we will have a boy 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.270
 violent and with bad character in general and 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.240
 as for her a strong girl 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.740
 bighead and fighter maybe the only thing 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.569
 bad it may be that some 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.780
 characters can get on your nerves 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.030
 more than anything at the beginning of the story 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.440
 and nothing more family subscribe and the 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.440
 it exists until dow and see you
