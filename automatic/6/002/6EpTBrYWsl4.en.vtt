00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.809
 in you the first and most extensive 4g network 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.079
 lte in puerto rico presents this 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:09.079
 segment 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.060
 victims of unscrupulous people who rob them 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.160
 items left inside the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.119
 cars according to a newspaper report 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.340
 this is possible thanks to an apparatus that 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.660
 allows detecting the existence of a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.269
 technological equipment in the vehicle but 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.210
 our technician wilton vargas does not explain 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.580
 why this is just a wheaton myth 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.040
 how it's going to be has been so long 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.690
 listening that there is a scanner and that 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.549
 by means of that scanner then the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.129
 rascals can detect that there are effects 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:56.150
 as a computer and other things and 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.470
 so there you can cut that inside 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.780
 a car 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.420
 nothing to do under any circumstances 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.260
 for several reasons you must first have 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 into account 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.460
 grisel than the cars and all the metal that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 surrounds them 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.659
 tec make it up I must say act like 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.630
 if you know when you put something in the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.189
 microwave and to cook because what 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.010
 is inside is cooked and what is 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.360
 outside not because it is contained within 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.720
 that microwave then 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.930
 metal all those rays those waves that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.880
 happens inside a car that is 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 all metal until the same happens the same 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.050
 if it is to that electronic equipment 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.930
 electronic device emit some type 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.700
 of signal that could be detected at the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.729
 distance can not certainly if 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.120
 because all that metal serves as a 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.450
 barrier that encases the signal plan that 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.250
 could issue that this could be issued 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.530
 facto electronic and will not be able to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.210
 detect or anything to be I think it happens to me 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.390
 I stopped in the car and did not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.360
 It has a lot of logic 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.979
 where does this myth come from look at this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.430
 and I want us to be able to see a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.990
 video in which this is on youtube it 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.820
 the people in these videos watch this video 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.800
 face supposedly this is a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.759
 device and let's see the hand of 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.190
 this person 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.480
 the supposed device that is what 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.980
 used to detect if inside the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.870
 car and a laptop an ipod or an iphone 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.720
 whatever a phone and so on 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.239
 but one very important thing look at that is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.240
 approach to and although you think that 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.020
 that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.650
 and that seems what catches as a slater to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.650
 this one that learns 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.170
 Well, what you are seeing is not 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.810
 other than the remote control of a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.850
 television converter box 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.550
 you can see that as in the paper 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.710
 the internet also supports everything 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.530
 they put him including videos videos in 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.690
 internet that supposedly show the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.670
 existence of a device that does not exist 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.280
 but with everything and that you recommend us 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.980
 that people leave my computer or 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
 be the acts or phones nothing in the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 vehicle for several reasons the first 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.520
 is that when you for example have one 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.640
 of these equipment in the vehicle and you 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.010
 you get to the place and you go to save it hey 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 oh if a device I understand 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.070
 Exactly they are seeing you and you may be 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.540
 watching from another vehicle with some 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.220
 binoculars look at what you just got 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.990
 there he is keeping something in the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.310
 trunk they go there after you 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.050
 questions but why I fix it to 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.240
 act because they were watching you and if 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.090
 you got that was binoculars more still 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.350
 wilton your tecno tico dotcom page 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.730
 there is that they can get all the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.440
 information 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.170
 so that people are up to date then 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.049
 technology that course because 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.879
 thank you very much for clarifying that doubt 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.470
 that's why I was more than 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.370
 says that it was like that but not 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.620
 only popcorn there are many popcorn 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.620
 Let us now go on with your morning
