and<00:00:14.930> think<00:00:15.930> that<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.199> didn't<00:00:16.470> work<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.920> was

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and think that it didn't work and it was

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.220 
and think that it didn't work and it was
going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.339> awful<00:00:17.689> but<00:00:18.689> it<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.050> works

lashes<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.219> tried<00:00:56.489> using<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.269> with<00:00:57.539> just

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
lashes I have tried using this with just

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.369 
lashes I have tried using this with just
another<00:00:58.170> mascara<00:00:58.679> and<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.309> did<00:00:59.429> not<00:00:59.579> work

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
another mascara and it did not work

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
another mascara and it did not work
nearly<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.429> there<00:01:03.089> you<00:01:03.149> go

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
nearly as well so there you go

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
nearly as well so there you go
the<00:01:03.570> two<00:01:03.749> of<00:01:03.870> these<00:01:03.989> together<00:01:04.140> cost<00:01:04.530> 25<00:01:04.920> pounds

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the two of these together cost 25 pounds

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.160 
the two of these together cost 25 pounds
so<00:01:05.310> it's<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.700> high-end<00:01:06.180> product<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.050> really

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so it's a high-end product but it really

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
so it's a high-end product but it really
is<00:01:07.350> worth<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:07.980> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
is worth it I'm actually going to just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.950 
is worth it I'm actually going to just
demonstrate<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.240> rather<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.660> keep

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
