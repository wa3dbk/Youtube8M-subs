00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
be talking about understanding law of

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.920 
be talking about understanding law of
diminishing<00:00:07.339> returns<00:00:07.640> when<00:00:08.480> it<00:00:08.600> applies<00:00:08.900> to

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
so why am I talking about economic

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.739 
so why am I talking about economic
principles<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:27.349> mens<00:00:28.009> style<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:28.579> see<00:00:29.419> this<00:00:29.599> a

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:29.749 
principles and mens style I see this a

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.720 
principles and mens style I see this a
lot<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.289> let<00:00:30.499> me<00:00:30.589> start<00:00:30.859> off<00:00:30.890> with<00:00:31.069> an<00:00:31.189> example

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
lot and let me start off with an example

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.430 
lot and let me start off with an example
so<00:00:31.819> you<00:00:31.909> can<00:00:32.029> understand<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.989> point<00:00:33.230> I'm

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
so you can understand the point I'm

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.979 
so you can understand the point I'm
trying<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:33.829> make<00:00:34.000> whenever<00:00:35.000> I<00:00:35.059> was<00:00:35.449> i<00:00:35.660> think<00:00:35.899> it

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
trying to make whenever I was i think it

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.040 
trying to make whenever I was i think it
was<00:00:36.109> studying<00:00:36.739> for<00:00:36.829> were<00:00:37.550> they<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.910> SATs<00:00:38.539> or<00:00:38.570> a

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
was studying for were they the SATs or a

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.170 
was studying for were they the SATs or a
cts<00:00:39.530> actually<00:00:40.219> i<00:00:40.280> took<00:00:40.460> both<00:00:40.699> when<00:00:40.940> i<00:00:40.969> was<00:00:41.149> in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
cts actually i took both when i was in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.939 
cts actually i took both when i was in
high<00:00:41.390> school<00:00:41.449> but<00:00:42.050> i<00:00:42.109> remember<00:00:42.620> there<00:00:42.859> were

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
high school but i remember there were

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.250 
high school but i remember there were
two<00:00:43.160> components<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.030> s80<00:00:44.390> there<00:00:44.989> was<00:00:45.109> the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
two components to the s80 there was the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.099 
two components to the s80 there was the
verbal<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.800> there<00:00:46.250> was<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.519> math<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:47.030> i<00:00:47.809> did

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
verbal and there was the math and i did

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.139 
verbal and there was the math and i did
really<00:00:48.379> well<00:00:48.469> on<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.829> math<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:49.399> first<00:00:49.699> test

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
really well on the math the first test

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.349 
really well on the math the first test
took<00:00:50.359> i<00:00:50.620> did<00:00:51.620> like<00:00:51.710> some<00:00:51.949> practice<00:00:52.370> exam<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.269> i

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
took i did like some practice exam and i

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.970 
took i did like some practice exam and i
didn't<00:00:53.660> do<00:00:53.750> too<00:00:53.899> great<00:00:54.109> on<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.469> verbal<00:00:54.620> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
didn't do too great on the verbal and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.189 
didn't do too great on the verbal and
what<00:00:55.550> i<00:00:55.579> saw<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.239> i<00:00:56.570> was<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:56.899> group<00:00:57.050> of

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
what i saw that i was in a group of

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.169 
what i saw that i was in a group of
people<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.129> lot<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.489> people<00:00:58.760> thought

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
people is it a lot of people thought

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.060 
people is it a lot of people thought
that<00:00:59.239> okay<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.870> math<00:01:00.109> I<00:01:00.410> did<00:01:00.649> really<00:01:00.800> well<00:01:00.920> on

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
that okay the math I did really well on

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.279 
that okay the math I did really well on
but<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.789> an<00:01:01.879> extra<00:01:02.030> ten<00:01:02.690> points<00:01:03.109> there

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
but I can get an extra ten points there

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.160 
but I can get an extra ten points there
if<00:01:03.499> I<00:01:04.100> put<00:01:04.400> in<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:04.670> many<00:01:04.909> hours<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:05.900> I

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
if I put in this many hours but I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.649 
if I put in this many hours but I
decided<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.070> focus<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.579> the<00:01:07.970> verbal<00:01:08.150> because

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
decided to focus on the verbal because

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.929 
decided to focus on the verbal because
the<00:01:08.810> way<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.229> looked<00:01:09.530> at<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:09.740> my<00:01:10.340> score<00:01:10.729> was<00:01:10.759> low

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
the way I looked at it my score was low

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.149 
the way I looked at it my score was low
enough<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:12.020> would<00:01:12.110> be<00:01:12.229> easier<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:12.799> me<00:01:13.040> to

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
enough that it would be easier for me to

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.210 
enough that it would be easier for me to
get<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.579> larger<00:01:14.270> return<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:15.439> focusing<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
get a larger return for focusing on the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.580 
get a larger return for focusing on the
verbal<00:01:16.430> then<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.180> would<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.079> math<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.470> mean

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
verbal then it would be the math I mean

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.740 
verbal then it would be the math I mean
just<00:01:18.770> as<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.220> closer<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.759> perfection<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
just as you get closer to perfection the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.319 
just as you get closer to perfection the
law<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.020> diminishing<00:01:21.350> returns<00:01:21.759> tells<00:01:22.759> us<00:01:22.939> that

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
law of diminishing returns tells us that

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.300 
law of diminishing returns tells us that
the<00:01:23.509> closer<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.020> get<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.229> perfection<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the closer you get the perfection the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.850 
the closer you get the perfection the
harder<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.509> get<00:01:26.659> each<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.320> every

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
harder it is to get each and every

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.120 
harder it is to get each and every
little<00:01:28.250> gain<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.119> true<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.049> same<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.560> true<00:01:30.649> in

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
little gain the true the same is true in

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.740 
little gain the true the same is true in
men<00:01:31.670> stand<00:01:32.000> by<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.119> way<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.299> scored<00:01:32.630> pretty

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
men stand by the way I scored pretty

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.980 
men stand by the way I scored pretty
well<00:01:32.869> but<00:01:33.409> no<00:01:34.369> when<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.030> comes<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.479> mens<00:01:35.719> style

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
well but no when it comes to mens style

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.520 
well but no when it comes to mens style
it's<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.560> same<00:01:36.890> thing<00:01:37.420> oftentimes<00:01:38.420> guys<00:01:39.229> get

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530
