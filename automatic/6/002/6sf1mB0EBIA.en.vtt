 It has been a good year since last year. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 enough to travel quite a lot 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.769
 I gave the most expensive kick and laughed. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.130
 Very cool, I laughed. Talk about another. 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.140
 thing does not love but throws in the face that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 I am but there how it was was everything 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.640
 Happy, we all agree, I hope. 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 It's been good, we'll start at 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.430
 2015 with the right foot guys today 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.530
 I bring you a gameplay 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 decod advanced wars fair is because here it is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.629
 your team channel and I bring more 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 clean and more galera but gameplay of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 today is very special because the vision 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 because it 's special here because it was the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.410
 flowers galera does not die this sharing 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.789
 its name range has 21 jan israel 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.520
 It was really cool the guy if I did not 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.579
 mistake the name of the map and is dancing and pi 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.309
 It was really cool to play this match, and I 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.290
 was playing there champion of the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 Carnival of the people is champion I do not know if the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 right word we'll make an excuse 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 of tse shark 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 I was not champion I was like 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 seeing all the doors in this part of the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 kind of because I did I was playing 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.420
 ball a shock as you know the way 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 Shock only has tim neff doctor and I 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 I was playing this map and like it was 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.000
 I was playing foral guys because there are 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.040
 On this map, the people are born. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 the ends of the map and pass through the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.990
 pass through these entrances in the middle and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.500
 type favors the work of those who play 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.509
 team 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 loves the guys by the side entrances 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.409
 in this part of where you have it and if those 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.939
 tubes then we'll look at those 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.649
 parts of the map becomes much easier 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.030
 because the doors are narrow and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.520
 usually cases at all by the medium 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 then the margin of error of your 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 scope and will be very small then the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 that I decided I said I could hire 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.680
 a lot of hospital turnover 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.729
 I have a great control on the radar I 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.399
 I'll stay here in the middle I will value 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.350
 here the middle and watch all the entries 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.149
 In spite of being alone, right? 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 and how I was sure of my sight 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 was playing well this way 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.269
 too calibrated even if you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.579
 I want to count the shots I made. 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.769
 I do not think I should have gone 10-a- side 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.840
 you can tell and comment and how 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.290
 hashtag with the shots I missed 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.909
 counting can also count the shots that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 for example from a shot in the car and my 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.780
 friend also gives a shot and then he kills 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.599
 first kill so you can count on 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.170
 a wrong shot but then it's too few 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.420
 shots 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.909
 I think a lot of this is because 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.250
 It was all with the 21 guys in the shoot 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.379
 near and that business I said 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.420
 I found in guys who were going through 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.489
 port and the margin of error of its scope 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.159
 when you're taking a guy in the middle 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.599
 the door is too small so it will act 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.139
 alone for you or for the smart ones 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.120
 understood value places that is with 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.500
 Jurandy, I'm actually saying that. 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.819
 because he was also playing poorly dumont 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.459
 China may be that if you are 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.989
 playing regular mode you die because 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.329
 crazy guys is not playing with a 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.430
 dream michigan with your boss then 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.150
 ends up complicating your work a little 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.310
 but then this tip I think is very good 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.049
 for this way of a shock I do not know 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.340
 Are you going to stay ready for more and more? 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.190
 if you stay 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.260
 God damn it, I 'll take it. 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 having too much fun throwing spray on 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.440
 It's true, I was not because it was a year. 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.730
 past and this gameplay and now that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.010
 I do not know if you're having it or not 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.590
 it is still under this stop that lobby that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.109
 is always in the code 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.379
 I told you I want you guys to be like 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.859
 in places like people stop because bosch 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.900
 It's just being pop then kind in these places. 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.269
 there the guys can not jump to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.949
 You see, I kind of killed the guys. 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.489
 on the door and has no popular project in 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.629
 what closed place then ends 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.159
 facilitating the work of those who are 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.019
 waiting the guys know not that you 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.169
 will be waiting for family to stop there at 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.729
 place but if you're kind already kind of like 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.859
 calculate in the middle of your 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:06.780
 you give a scopino scopino and face scopino 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.250
 will make the job much easier and will 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.959
 being on the run yet only you are 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.909
 waiting for the guy and he'll be in the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.090
 run then until you pull him 'you 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.099
 He has already killed his grandmother, father to mother and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.070
 Everybody until the dog messes 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.870

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.240
 Said I did not really sing so much 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.039
 I am not a valued one and the place that is 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.850
 the middle of the map where it had 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.199
 movement 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.910
