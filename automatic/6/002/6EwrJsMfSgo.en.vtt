hello everyone this is Pat with you
today<00:00:03.419> at<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.810> first<00:00:03.959> store<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> found<00:00:04.620> this

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
today at the first store I found this

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.030 
today at the first store I found this
video<00:00:05.069> projector<00:00:05.870> I<00:00:06.870> put<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> my

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
video projector I put it in one of my

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.720 
video projector I put it in one of my
Pelican<00:00:08.490> cases<00:00:08.730> for<00:00:10.280> transporting<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.570> but

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
Pelican cases for transporting it but

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.050 
Pelican cases for transporting it but
they<00:00:14.730> had<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> goodwill<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.970> got<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
they had this at the goodwill I got it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.650 
they had this at the goodwill I got it
for<00:00:18.800> $38<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.430> sharp<00:00:20.880> XR<00:00:21.660> -<00:00:22.050> 1<00:00:22.439> 0<00:00:22.769> X<00:00:23.660> DLP

technology DLP technology uses a
semiconductor<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> bunch<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> little

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
semiconductor with a bunch of little

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
semiconductor with a bunch of little
reflective<00:00:32.399> mirrors<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.300> act<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.200> little

reflective mirrors that act as little

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.340 
reflective mirrors that act as little
switches<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.700> spinning<00:00:36.149> color<00:00:36.390> disc<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
switches and a spinning color disc so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400 
switches and a spinning color disc so
when<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> disc<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> over<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.780> color<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
when it's the disc is over one color it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
when it's the disc is over one color it
moves<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> mirror<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> blue

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
moves the mirror so that all the blue

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
moves the mirror so that all the blue
spots<00:00:43.320> light<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> over<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
spots light up and that's this over the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
spots light up and that's this over the
red<00:00:45.000> section<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> red<00:00:46.620> pixels<00:00:47.129> light<00:00:47.280> up

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
red section all the red pixels light up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.720 
red section all the red pixels light up
and<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:49.140> has<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.620> color<00:00:49.920> disc<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and so on it has a four color disc I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.689 
and so on it has a four color disc I
think<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.260> red<00:00:52.260> green<00:00:52.649> blue<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:54.170> clear<00:00:55.699> for

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
think it's red green blue and clear for

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
think it's red green blue and clear for
white<00:00:56.940> light<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:58.020> sure<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> could<00:00:58.500> be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
white light but I'm not sure it could be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
white light but I'm not sure it could be
yellow<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:02.730> has<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> zoom<00:01:03.860> focus<00:01:05.390> all<00:01:06.390> the

think it was a brand new bulb in it if

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.780 
think it was a brand new bulb in it if
we<00:02:21.909> go<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.420> take<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> look<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:25.530> oops

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
we go and take a look here oops

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.720 
we go and take a look here oops
fixing<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:28.810> take<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> look<00:02:29.260> at<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.769> lamp

that<00:02:40.359> means<00:02:40.689> it's<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.019> brand<00:02:41.230> new<00:02:41.319> bulb<00:02:41.620> or<00:02:41.950> it's

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
that means it's a brand new bulb or it's

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.099

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
almost used up because the normal life

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.339 
almost used up because the normal life
of<00:02:44.290> bulbs<00:02:44.680> 2000<00:02:45.159> hours<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.560> MSRP<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.700> this

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
built-in speakers let's go ahead and now

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.530 
built-in speakers let's go ahead and now
put<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> disc<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.489> now<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.659> is<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.189> projected<00:03:06.189> on

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
put a disc in now this is a projected on

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.879 
put a disc in now this is a projected on
from<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.629> DVD<00:03:07.780> player<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.409> it's<00:03:08.530> only<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.829> to

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
from a DVD player so it's only going to

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.580 
from a DVD player so it's only going to
be<00:03:08.950> 480<00:03:09.489> but<00:03:10.420> from<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.900> computer<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.439> will

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
be 480 but from a computer this will

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.800 
be 480 but from a computer this will
accept<00:03:12.209> 720p<00:03:13.209> or<00:03:13.239> 1080i<00:03:14.049> natively<00:03:15.010> at<00:03:15.189> 720p

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.360 

detail<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.900> quite<00:03:20.049> good<00:03:20.410> let's<00:03:20.949> even<00:03:21.129> get<00:03:21.340> a

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
detail is quite good let's even get a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.270 
detail is quite good let's even get a
close<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.910> image<00:03:24.599> looks<00:03:25.599> pretty<00:03:25.810> good<00:03:26.280> but

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
close to the image looks pretty good but

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.189 
close to the image looks pretty good but
up<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.930> $38<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.199> think<00:03:29.349> it's<00:03:29.470> quite<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.739> deal<00:03:31.199> you

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
up for $38 I think it's quite a deal you

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.170 
up for $38 I think it's quite a deal you
even<00:03:32.409> have<00:03:32.530> sound<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.669> hear<00:03:33.699> the<00:03:33.970> sound

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
even have sound you can hear the sound

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:43.280 
even have sound you can hear the sound
coming<00:03:34.389> from<00:03:34.449> the<00:03:34.629> projector

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.309 

this<00:03:44.290> movie<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.859> party<00:03:45.250> monsters<00:03:45.989> it's<00:03:46.989> one<00:03:47.229> of

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
this movie is party monsters it's one of

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.680 
this movie is party monsters it's one of
my<00:03:47.409> favorite<00:03:47.769> movies<00:03:52.229> picture<00:03:53.229> looks<00:03:53.440> great

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
my favorite movies picture looks great

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.140 
my favorite movies picture looks great
right<00:03:55.690> now<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.199> Keystone<00:03:57.150> offset

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
right now I have the Keystone offset

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.759 
right now I have the Keystone offset
adjusted<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.870> can<00:03:59.079> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.349> see<00:03:59.560> the

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
adjusted you can kind of see the

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.780 
adjusted you can kind of see the
difference<00:04:00.190> right<00:04:00.340> there

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
difference right there

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.390 
difference right there
instead<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.840> projector<00:04:02.560> black<00:04:02.739> true<00:04:03.159> black

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
instead the projector black true black

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.330 
instead the projector black true black
is<00:04:03.669> that<00:04:03.909> line<00:04:04.120> right<00:04:04.329> there<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:05.129> then<00:04:06.129> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
is that line right there and then the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.670 
is that line right there and then the
screen<00:04:06.849> itself<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.750> am<00:04:08.139> reducing<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
screen itself so I am reducing the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.740 
screen itself so I am reducing the
quality<00:04:09.069> by<00:04:09.190> doing<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.639> because<00:04:10.180> you're

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
quality by doing that because you're

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.530 
quality by doing that because you're
lowering<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.620> pixels<00:04:12.010> but<00:04:12.760> coming<00:04:13.030> from<00:04:13.090> DVD

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
lowering the pixels but coming from DVD

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.879 
lowering the pixels but coming from DVD
it's<00:04:13.690> not<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.019> high<00:04:14.139> of<00:04:14.229> resolution<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.829> the

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
it's not that high of resolution in the

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.949 
it's not that high of resolution in the
first<00:04:15.099> place<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.150> you're<00:04:16.329> not<00:04:16.449> losing<00:04:16.659> that

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
first place so you're not losing that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.289 
first place so you're not losing that
much<00:04:17.169> information<00:04:17.829> but<00:04:18.459> normally<00:04:18.880> you'd<00:04:19.060> want

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
much information but normally you'd want

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.379 
much information but normally you'd want
to<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.709> Keystone<00:04:20.919> dead<00:04:21.340> on<00:04:21.519> so<00:04:22.210> that

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
to have that Keystone dead on so that

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.129 
to have that Keystone dead on so that
you<00:04:22.539> use<00:04:22.900> all<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.770> space<00:04:23.979> on<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> DLP<00:04:25.240> chip

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
you use all of the space on the DLP chip

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.360 
you use all of the space on the DLP chip
here's<00:04:26.919> how<00:04:27.039> its<00:04:27.189> set<00:04:27.370> up<00:04:27.400> on<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.729> floor<00:04:29.370> you

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
here's how its set up on the floor you

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.390 
here's how its set up on the floor you
see<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.669> has<00:04:30.759> three<00:04:31.000> fans<00:04:31.270> for<00:04:31.629> cooling<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
see it has three fans for cooling the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.179 
see it has three fans for cooling the
lamp<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.610> lamp<00:04:33.939> runs<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.419> 300<00:04:35.169> watts<00:04:35.469> I<00:04:35.919> think

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
lamp that lamp runs a 300 watts I think

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.249 
lamp that lamp runs a 300 watts I think
I<00:04:36.460> looked<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.419> eBay<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.110> get<00:04:38.229> a

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
I looked on eBay and you can get a

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.749 
I looked on eBay and you can get a
replacement<00:04:38.500> lamp<00:04:38.949> for<00:04:39.069> this<00:04:39.219> model<00:04:39.460> for

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
replacement lamp for this model for

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.730 
replacement lamp for this model for
around<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.360> hundred<00:04:40.870> dollars<00:04:41.080> so<00:04:41.590> it's

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
around a hundred dollars so it's

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.080 
around a hundred dollars so it's
actually<00:04:41.919> not<00:04:42.219> that<00:04:42.280> bad<00:04:42.610> one<00:04:42.879> hundred

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
actually not that bad one hundred

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.559 
actually not that bad one hundred
dollars<00:04:43.389> for<00:04:43.599> a<00:04:43.659> two<00:04:44.259> thousand<00:04:44.650> our<00:04:44.740> lamp

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569

dollars for a two thousand our lamp
here's<00:04:46.569> my<00:04:46.750> older<00:04:47.020> projector<00:04:47.469> this<00:04:47.680> one<00:04:47.860> was

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
here's my older projector this one was

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.600 
here's my older projector this one was
made<00:04:48.219> in<00:04:48.370> 1994<00:04:49.620> MSRP<00:04:50.620> was<00:04:50.949> around<00:04:51.219> six

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
made in 1994 MSRP was around six

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.580 
made in 1994 MSRP was around six
thousand<00:04:52.000> dollars<00:04:52.300> her<00:04:52.719> back<00:04:52.960> then<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.409> was

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
thousand dollars her back then that was

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.649 
thousand dollars her back then that was
about<00:04:54.400> right<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.930> one<00:04:56.080> uses<00:04:56.379> halogen<00:04:56.830> bulbs

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
about right this one uses halogen bulbs

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.189 
about right this one uses halogen bulbs
it<00:04:58.659> has<00:04:58.870> two<00:04:59.139> bulbs<00:04:59.409> in<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> projector<00:05:00.279> and<00:05:01.199> a

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
it has two bulbs in the projector and a

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.629 
it has two bulbs in the projector and a
slider<00:05:02.500> for<00:05:02.650> when<00:05:02.949> they<00:05:03.039> burn<00:05:03.189> out<00:05:03.370> because

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
slider for when they burn out because

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.809 
slider for when they burn out because
they<00:05:03.759> burned<00:05:03.939> out<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.090> often<00:05:05.370> those<00:05:06.370> being<00:05:06.610> 200

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
they burned out so often those being 200
