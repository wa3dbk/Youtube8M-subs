00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
from Blaszczykowski and we do end up

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
from Blaszczykowski and we do end up
converting<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> 2-1

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so we're doing all right here but it all

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
so we're doing all right here but it all
goes<00:01:45.990> wrong<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.560> maggio<00:01:46.979> climbs<00:01:47.729> again<00:01:48.119> at

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270

the back post it manages to head that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.800 
the back post it manages to head that
one<00:01:49.950> home<00:01:50.159> bit<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.939> strange<00:01:51.180> celebration

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
one home bit of a strange celebration

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.510 
one home bit of a strange celebration
just<00:01:52.049> falling<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> goalkeeper<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
just falling over the goalkeeper but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
just falling over the goalkeeper but
nonetheless<00:01:54.180> he<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.659> equal<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.110> point<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
nonetheless he is equal at this point so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.929 
nonetheless he is equal at this point so
we<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.100> need<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> score<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.820> more

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
we are going to need to score one more

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.310 
we are going to need to score one more
if<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.420> chance<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.810> winning<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
if we want a chance of winning it and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
if we want a chance of winning it and
here<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> try<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.700> get

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
here we go we're going to try and get

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
here we go we're going to try and get
the<00:01:59.909> goal<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.270> managed<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.170> past<00:02:01.439> him<00:02:01.590> 11

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the goal now managed to go past him 11

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.139 
the goal now managed to go past him 11
doski<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.520> there's<00:02:02.640> probably<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.909> foul

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
doski I think there's probably a foul

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
doski I think there's probably a foul
from<00:02:03.329> him<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.689> he<00:02:04.140> absolutely<00:02:04.380> bumped

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
from him as he absolutely bumped

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.469 
from him as he absolutely bumped
levendusky<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> ball<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.210> he's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
levendusky off the ball but he's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
levendusky off the ball but he's
strength<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.350> powered<00:02:07.829> through<00:02:08.069> went<00:02:08.520> past

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
strength just powered through went past

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
strength just powered through went past
ogbonna<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> ended<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.629> scoring<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> 64th

ogbonna and ended up scoring in the 64th

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.680 
ogbonna and ended up scoring in the 64th
minute<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:11.940> good<00:02:12.209> result<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
minute so a very good result for the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.140 
minute so a very good result for the
team

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
team

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.819 
team
32<00:02:13.569> we're<00:02:13.810> taking<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.200> three<00:02:14.409> points<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
32 we're taking down three points and

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.080 
32 we're taking down three points and
that's<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.129> most<00:02:15.370> important<00:02:15.849> thing<00:02:15.879> about

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that's the most important thing about

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.839 
that's the most important thing about
that<00:02:16.360> nine<00:02:16.959> points<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.799> of<00:02:17.860> our<00:02:18.430> first

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
that nine points now out of our first

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.240 
that nine points now out of our first
five<00:02:19.329> games<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.470> don't<00:02:20.829> think<00:02:21.069> we're<00:02:21.159> going

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
five games and I don't think we're going

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.160 
five games and I don't think we're going
to<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.670> problem<00:02:21.909> in<00:02:22.329> staying<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.079> the

even on the top page now I know we've

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.319 
even on the top page now I know we've
only<00:02:44.349> used<00:02:44.530> him<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:44.950> maybe<00:02:45.280> three<00:02:45.790> games<00:02:46.120> but

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.960 
and I haven't actually played against
him<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:11.889> is<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.099> first<00:03:12.310> time<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.579> saw<00:03:12.760> him

him so this is the first time I saw him

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.300 
him so this is the first time I saw him
and<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:14.109> don't<00:03:14.650> think<00:03:14.709> he<00:03:14.829> really<00:03:15.010> got<00:03:15.069> involved

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.189 
chances well we did have a couple but
they<00:03:54.340> weren't<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:54.790> clear-cut<00:03:55.269> chances<00:03:55.720> not

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
they weren't like clear-cut chances not

and<00:03:58.169> unfortunately<00:03:59.169> that's<00:03:59.470> going<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.739> make

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
and unfortunately that's going to make

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.469 
and unfortunately that's going to make
it<00:03:59.949> very<00:04:00.099> difficult<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.609> win<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.909> title<00:04:01.090> and

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
it very difficult to win the title and

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
from him and eventually we tip it over

the<00:06:53.779> bar<00:06:53.959> for<00:06:54.349> a<00:06:54.379> corner<00:06:54.759> however<00:06:55.759> the<00:06:56.300> corner

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:56.629 
the bar for a corner however the corner

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:58.989 
the bar for a corner however the corner
comes<00:06:56.809> in<00:06:57.019> and<00:06:57.199> he<00:06:57.259> does<00:06:57.469> indeed<00:06:58.009> convert<00:06:58.819> that

00:06:58.989 --> 00:06:58.999

one<00:06:59.209> with<00:06:59.389> PK<00:06:59.839> he's<00:07:00.559> absolutely<00:07:00.889> huge<00:07:01.219> PK<00:07:01.580> so

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 
one with PK he's absolutely huge PK so

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.279 
one with PK he's absolutely huge PK so
you<00:07:01.849> can<00:07:01.969> expect<00:07:02.179> to<00:07:02.269> him<00:07:02.479> get<00:07:02.869> up<00:07:02.959> pretty<00:07:03.169> well

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
you can expect to him get up pretty well

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.509 
you can expect to him get up pretty well
and<00:07:03.499> score<00:07:03.709> some<00:07:03.739> goals<00:07:04.009> but<00:07:04.249> there<00:07:04.399> you<00:07:04.459> go

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:04.519 
and score some goals but there you go
