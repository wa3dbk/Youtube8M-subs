00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.770
 vertical blind measurements measured in the opening 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.980
 when measuring the width of the width you need to subtract 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.630
 10 15 millimeters 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.080
 to feed unimpeded 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.240
 fell into place 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 and from the height and subtract 10 15 millimeters 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.939
 what was the world they touched the windowsill 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.570
 be sure to consider the moment 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.490
 As a rule, the slopes of the block area 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 it becomes already therefore initially 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.250
 the next height is best measured 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.599
 at a distance of 50 and 70 millimeters deep 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.970
 opening the slope 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 in this case, peace will be produced 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.640
 right 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.820
 Be sure to make sure that after 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.890
 installation of blinds you can open 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.880
 sash 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.440
 do the following 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.640
 open the casement window and measure the distance 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 from the upper edge of the sash and upper 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.360
 slope at the eaves installation point 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.440
 must be at least forty five 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.330
 millimeters 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.390
 otherwise we recommend 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.980
 make a cover for the world pay 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.540
 attention window may not be rectangular 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.040
 or window sill can be installed nepal 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.660
 the level of either convicted is therefore better for peace 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.240
 just produce at three points in height 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.930
 widths 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.230
 over measure pad with reading mount 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.160
 to the height of the opening add the desired 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.410
 distances between and the top corner of the slope 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.590
 and the ceiling but that this distance was 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 not less than one hundred and 150 millimeters for 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 fastening reliability without forgetting you to clean 10 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.530
 15 millimeters 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.759

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.770
 no add to desired distance 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.099
 not less than one hundred eighty two hundred 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.239
 millimeters to avoid side 

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:40.600
 gaps 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.979
 ceiling installation is that even with 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.210
 protruding truth window sill blinds 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.149
 can measure yes gender without

 moving the cornice across the ceiling like walls in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 In this case, you need to retreat 40 70 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.420
 millimeters for convenience about Borki 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.470
 rooms also have vertical blinds 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 can be made under the wall to the wall closing 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.310
 not only the window but everything is there and for us 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.100
 convenience of management can be made 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.179
 construction of two eaves 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.809
 and close them with a single decorative
