how<00:01:14.909> much<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> sucks<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.140> its<00:01:16.320> own<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
how much it sucks like on its own and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
how much it sucks like on its own and
that's<00:01:16.920> before<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.490> add<00:01:17.640> connect<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's before you add connect to the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's before you add connect to the
equation<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> imagine<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
equation you can imagine how that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
equation you can imagine how that
affects<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> Sun<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.750> could<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
affects the Sun or you could just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
affects the Sun or you could just
consult<00:01:22.470> my<00:01:22.590> review<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:22.890> watch<00:01:23.159> me<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.490> a
