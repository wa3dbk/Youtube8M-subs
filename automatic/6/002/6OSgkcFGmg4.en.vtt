the three three-quarter inch Marvel
Universe<00:00:51.239> version<00:00:51.809> never<00:00:52.440> came<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.739> because

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I like this one more I just do I think

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099 
I like this one more I just do I think
this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> better<00:00:57.270> commander<00:00:57.870> Steve

Rogers<00:00:58.559> figure<00:00:58.980> overall<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> paint

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
Rogers figure overall I think the paint

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
Rogers figure overall I think the paint
detail<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.649> better<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.309> accurate<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:03.149> think

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
detail is better more accurate I think

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
detail is better more accurate I think
the<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.379> color<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> boots<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

gloves came out a little bit better now

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
reviewed this figure before I could put

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
up an annotation of it but this does

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
up an annotation of it but this does
have<00:01:19.619> paint<00:01:19.979> shading<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:21.000> whereas<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
have paint shading in there whereas this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
have paint shading in there whereas this
guy<00:01:22.229> doesn't<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.070> any<00:01:23.250> paint<00:01:23.549> shading<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
guy doesn't have any paint shading in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
guy doesn't have any paint shading in
the<00:01:24.150> boots<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.960> darker<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> then

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the boots and it's much darker and then

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
the boots and it's much darker and then
if<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> look<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.400> other<00:01:26.640> version<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
if you look at this other version this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
if you look at this other version this
tan<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.290> very<00:01:28.590> light<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.189> don't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
tan is very very light which I don't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
tan is very very light which I don't
like<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.110> color<00:01:31.320> choices

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like at all so I think the color choices

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
like at all so I think the color choices
just<00:01:32.430> came<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.790> perfectly<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> could

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
just came out perfectly and so you could

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.300 
just came out perfectly and so you could
see<00:01:33.750> how<00:01:33.900> he's<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.530> lighter<00:01:34.920> blue

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
see how he's got a much lighter blue

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
see how he's got a much lighter blue
than<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.720> guy<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.799> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
than this guy right here and then this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
than this guy right here and then this
one's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.729> straight<00:01:39.360> straight<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.930> black<00:01:40.170> or

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
one's just straight straight up black or

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
one's just straight straight up black or
midnight<00:01:41.100> blue<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.610> guess<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.420> almost

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
midnight blue I guess but almost

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.109 
midnight blue I guess but almost
completely<00:01:43.500> black<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> color

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
completely black so I think the color

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
completely black so I think the color
choices<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> head<00:01:46.170> sculpt<00:01:46.649> right

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
choices and then the head sculpt right

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.069 
choices and then the head sculpt right
here<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.820> funky<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.049> guess

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
here is a little funky looking I guess

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
here is a little funky looking I guess
in<00:01:49.409> comparison<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.790> imagine<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
in comparison but if you can imagine it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.060 
in comparison but if you can imagine it
in<00:01:51.479> 6-inch<00:01:52.170> form<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.649> look<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> little

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
in 6-inch form it would look a little

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
in 6-inch form it would look a little
cooler<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.850> opposed<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.020> which

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
cooler as opposed to this one which

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
cooler as opposed to this one which
isn't<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> great<00:01:56.670> either<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.600> kind

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
isn't really that great either it's kind

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.130 
isn't really that great either it's kind
of<00:01:58.140> weird<00:01:58.979> no<00:01:59.610> no<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.600> older

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
of weird no no just a little older

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
of weird no no just a little older
looking<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.070> didn't<00:02:02.340> notice<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> between

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
looking and I didn't notice that between

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.639 
looking and I didn't notice that between
these<00:02:03.329> two<00:02:03.509> figures<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> difference

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
these two figures there is a difference

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
these two figures there is a difference
in<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> flesh<00:02:05.100> tone<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in the flesh tone so you could see this

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
in the flesh tone so you could see this
guy's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.500> bit<00:02:07.619> whiter<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.369> guy's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
guy's a little bit whiter and this guy's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.630 
guy's a little bit whiter and this guy's
got<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.270> darker<00:02:10.020> tone<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.129> his<00:02:11.220> skin

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
got more of a darker tone to his skin

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
got more of a darker tone to his skin
color<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:13.050> pretty<00:02:13.290> cool

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
color so I think that's pretty cool

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.160 
color so I think that's pretty cool
hair<00:02:13.980> detail<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> same<00:02:15.330> well<00:02:15.900> actually

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hair detail is the same well actually

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.330 
hair detail is the same well actually
this<00:02:16.500> guy<00:02:16.620> looks<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:16.830> he<00:02:16.980> has<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.190> bit

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
this guy looks like he has a little bit

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.630 
this guy looks like he has a little bit
more<00:02:17.460> variation<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.390> colors<00:02:18.780> over<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.640> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
more variation in colors over here it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.220 
more variation in colors over here it
could<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:20.910> been<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.540> individual<00:02:22.080> one

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
could have just been this individual one

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.960 
could have just been this individual one
but<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> some<00:02:23.790> nice

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
but I do like that there is some nice

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.680 
but I do like that there is some nice
paint<00:02:24.240> detail<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.420> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
paint detail in there and I do like that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
paint detail in there and I do like that
they<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.350> version<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.890> has<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.190> blue

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
they have this version that has the blue

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.500 
they have this version that has the blue
even<00:02:29.610> though<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.700> wish<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> front<00:02:30.300> had<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
even though I wish the front had a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.000 
even though I wish the front had a
little<00:02:30.690> bit<00:02:30.810> more<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.230> color<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.800> on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
little bit more of this color going on

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.730 
little bit more of this color going on
you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.850> see<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.390> there's<00:02:33.540> very<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.500> some

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
you can see so there's very there's some

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.770 
you can see so there's very there's some
shading<00:02:35.070> involved<00:02:35.730> which<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:35.940> tight<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.570> think

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
shading involved which is tight I think

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.020 
shading involved which is tight I think
that's<00:02:36.960> dope<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.770> see<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.880> how

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that's dope so you can see you know how

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.180 
that's dope so you can see you know how
there's<00:02:39.240> black<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.840> blue<00:02:40.080> mixed<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.950> there

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
there's black and blue mixed in there

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.460 
there's black and blue mixed in there
it's<00:02:42.030> pretty<00:02:42.209> subtle<00:02:42.480> especially<00:02:43.140> compared

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it's pretty subtle especially compared

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.199 
it's pretty subtle especially compared
to<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.040> think<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.490> coloring<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.030> this

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
to this one I think the coloring on this

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.820 
to this one I think the coloring on this
one<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.480> came<00:02:45.690> out<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.050> much<00:02:46.290> better<00:02:46.500> plus

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
one just came out much much better plus

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
one just came out much much better plus
he<00:02:46.980> has<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> star<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.640> shoulder<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.330> one

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
he has a star on the shoulder this one

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
he has a star on the shoulder this one
we<00:02:48.660> don't<00:02:48.780> get<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.990> star<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.440> shoulder<00:02:49.830> so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
we don't get a star on the shoulder so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.640 
we don't get a star on the shoulder so
it's<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.360> joint<00:02:51.780> articulation<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's just the joint articulation is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's just the joint articulation is
different<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.370> guy<00:02:53.550> than<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.910> guy<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
different for this guy than this guy I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.640 
different for this guy than this guy I
think<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.630> they<00:02:54.720> didn't<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.530> know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
think and they didn't want to you know

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.979 
think and they didn't want to you know
risk<00:02:56.400> putting<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.970> circle<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> star

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
risk putting the circle with the star

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.440 
risk putting the circle with the star
over<00:02:58.230> here<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.100> getting<00:02:59.400> ruined<00:02:59.790> so

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
over here and have it getting ruined so

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.600 
over here and have it getting ruined so
he<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.989> then<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.620> guy<00:03:01.890> actually<00:03:02.310> comes<00:03:02.520> with

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
he and then this guy actually comes with

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090 
he and then this guy actually comes with
the<00:03:02.790> other<00:03:02.910> shield<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.200> I'll<00:03:04.650> switch<00:03:04.830> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the other shield so I'll switch the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.880 
the other shield so I'll switch the
shields<00:03:05.459> back<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.260> regular<00:03:07.590> version

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
shields back but so this regular version

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.380 
shields back but so this regular version
is<00:03:08.010> actually<00:03:08.160> pretty<00:03:08.580> easy<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.910> find<00:03:09.239> in

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
is actually pretty easy to find in

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.570 
is actually pretty easy to find in
stores<00:03:09.600> now<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.770> while<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.220> harder

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
stores now for a while it was the harder

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.460 
stores now for a while it was the harder
one<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> get<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.080> comes<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.350> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
one to get so this one comes with the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.460 
one to get so this one comes with the
regular<00:03:13.800> shield<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.430> then<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.640> variant

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
regular shield and then this variant

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.840 
regular shield and then this variant
comes<00:03:16.470> with<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> photon<00:03:17.130> shield<00:03:17.459> which<00:03:17.640> I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
comes with the photon shield which I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.560 
comes with the photon shield which I
like<00:03:18.060> more

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
like more

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.360 
like more
I<00:03:18.600> think<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:18.989> photon<00:03:19.380> shield<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.890> very<00:03:20.100> very

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
I think this photon shield is very very

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.490 
I think this photon shield is very very
cool<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.720> other<00:03:21.810> shields<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.380> has

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
cool and that's the other shields it has

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.470 
cool and that's the other shields it has
a<00:03:22.530> function<00:03:23.130> where<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.549> flips<00:03:23.790> back<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
a function where it flips back so you

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.990 
a function where it flips back so you
could<00:03:24.630> plug<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.980> hole<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.400> his<00:03:26.430> back

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
could plug it into the hole on his back

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.300 
could plug it into the hole on his back
like<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.290> want<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:29.070> doesn't

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
like that if you want which doesn't

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.830 
like that if you want which doesn't
really<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.519> sense<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.060> photon<00:03:30.480> shield

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
really make sense for the photon shield

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.650 
really make sense for the photon shield
but<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.440> still<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.540> also

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
but you can still do it and then it also

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.880 
but you can still do it and then it also
has<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.870> clip<00:03:34.170> right<00:03:34.290> there<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.739> could

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
has the clip right there so you could

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.140 
has the clip right there so you could
put<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.130> right<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.370> his<00:03:35.519> wrist<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.030> was

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
put it right on his wrist like I was

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.390 
put it right on his wrist like I was
showing<00:03:36.299> before<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.500> yeah<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.070> like

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
showing before so yeah and I do like

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.130 
showing before so yeah and I do like
that<00:03:38.430> they<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.910> these<00:03:39.540> parts<00:03:39.959> right<00:03:40.049> here

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
that they have these parts right here

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.940 
that they have these parts right here
painted<00:03:40.560> silver

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
painted silver

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.979 
painted silver
I<00:03:41.100> think<00:03:41.400> that's<00:03:41.549> dope<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.630> could<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.870> used

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I think that's dope you could have used

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.320 
I think that's dope you could have used
a<00:03:43.110> little<00:03:43.140> bit<00:03:43.380> more<00:03:43.470> silver<00:03:44.040> again<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:45.090> guy

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
a little bit more silver again this guy

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.150 
a little bit more silver again this guy
has<00:03:45.570> more<00:03:45.810> silver<00:03:46.290> painted<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.769> him<00:03:47.010> even

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
has more silver painted on him even

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.590 
has more silver painted on him even
though<00:03:47.310> he's<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.489> smaller<00:03:47.850> figure<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
though he's a smaller figure like on the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.630 
though he's a smaller figure like on the
belt<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.989> could<00:03:49.110> see<00:03:49.350> all<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> silver<00:03:50.010> on

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
belt you could see all the silver on

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.979 
belt you could see all the silver on
these<00:03:50.820> loops<00:03:51.120> right<00:03:51.299> here<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
these loops right here and then the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.479 
these loops right here and then the
other<00:03:52.019> thing<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.590> didn't<00:03:52.980> really<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.280> too

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
other thing I didn't really like too

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.220 
other thing I didn't really like too
much<00:03:53.640> about<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.209> legends<00:03:54.690> version<00:03:55.049> is<00:03:55.140> that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
much about this legends version is that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.539 
much about this legends version is that
he<00:03:55.320> doesn't<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> strap<00:03:56.100> going<00:03:56.370> across

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
he doesn't have the strap going across

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.130 
he doesn't have the strap going across
so<00:03:56.850> it's<00:03:57.060> just<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.390> he<00:03:57.600> has<00:03:57.750> these<00:03:57.870> two

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
so it's just like he has these two

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.710 
so it's just like he has these two
loopies<00:03:58.709> going<00:03:59.519> around<00:03:59.760> his<00:03:59.970> shoulders<00:04:00.450> or

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
loopies going around his shoulders or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.030 
loopies going around his shoulders or
you<00:04:01.140> know<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.380> one<00:04:01.500> makes<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.769> little<00:04:01.860> more

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you know this one makes a little more

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.979 
you know this one makes a little more
sense<00:04:02.100> having<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.850> piece<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.720> across

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
sense having this piece going across

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.900 
sense having this piece going across
right<00:04:04.290> here<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:05.220> wouldn't<00:04:05.430> interfere<00:04:05.670> with

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
right here that wouldn't interfere with

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.580 
right here that wouldn't interfere with
this<00:04:06.180> whole<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.720> think<00:04:07.080> they<00:04:07.230> really<00:04:07.470> could

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
this whole I think they really could

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.050 
this whole I think they really could
have<00:04:07.680> done<00:04:07.769> it<00:04:07.890> if<00:04:08.010> they<00:04:08.160> wanted<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:08.850> oh

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
have done it if they wanted to but oh

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.140 
have done it if they wanted to but oh
well<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.440> know<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> what<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
well you know that it is what it is and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.420 
well you know that it is what it is and
he<00:04:12.209> comes<00:04:12.420> with<00:04:12.600> two<00:04:12.900> guns<00:04:13.200> he<00:04:13.950> comes<00:04:14.130> with

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
he comes with two guns he comes with

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.460 
he comes with two guns he comes with
this<00:04:14.880> one<00:04:15.060> right<00:04:15.209> here<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.810> he<00:04:15.930> comes<00:04:16.169> with

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
this one right here and he comes with

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
this one right here and he comes with
this<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.100> right<00:04:17.220> here<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.459> they're<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.239> same

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
this one right here so they're the same

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.469 
this one right here so they're the same
exact<00:04:19.109> gun<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.640> think<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> paint<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.450> just

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
exact gun and I think the paint is just

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.370 
exact gun and I think the paint is just
slightly<00:04:22.380> different<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.950> these<00:04:23.099> I<00:04:23.400> don't<00:04:23.460> know

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
slightly different on these I don't know

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.540 
slightly different on these I don't know
ones<00:04:25.380> from<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.800> variant<00:04:26.099> ones<00:04:26.280> from<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
ones from the variant ones from the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.200 
ones from the variant ones from the
regular<00:04:26.849> version

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
regular version

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.059 
regular version
but<00:04:27.509> they're<00:04:27.810> more<00:04:28.259> or<00:04:28.350> less<00:04:28.470> exactly<00:04:28.889> the

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
but they're more or less exactly the

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.850 
but they're more or less exactly the
same<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.720> yeah<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:30.960> those<00:04:31.080> orders<00:04:31.319> to<00:04:31.500> guns<00:04:31.740> I

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
same and yeah so those orders to guns I

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.809 
same and yeah so those orders to guns I
wish<00:04:31.979> there's<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.280> place<00:04:32.460> where<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.699> could

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
wish there's a place where you could

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.740 
wish there's a place where you could
really<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.840> know<00:04:33.960> store<00:04:34.470> them<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.190> figure

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
really you know store them on the figure

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.150 
really you know store them on the figure
like<00:04:36.750> he<00:04:36.870> could<00:04:36.990> put<00:04:37.139> him<00:04:37.229> in<00:04:37.319> his<00:04:37.410> loops<00:04:37.710> right

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
like he could put him in his loops right

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.210 
like he could put him in his loops right
here<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.610> guess<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.930> could<00:04:40.080> kind<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.620> work<00:04:40.889> I

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
here I guess that could kind of work I

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.830 
here I guess that could kind of work I
don't<00:04:41.550> know<00:04:41.639> it's<00:04:41.789> kind<00:04:42.030> of<00:04:42.060> tricky<00:04:42.449> not

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
don't know it's kind of tricky not

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.460 
don't know it's kind of tricky not
really<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.500> don't<00:04:44.130> know<00:04:44.430> how<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:45.259> yeah

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
really I don't know how I yeah

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.779 
really I don't know how I yeah
so<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.800> doesn't<00:04:47.009> really<00:04:47.160> seem<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.550> he<00:04:47.639> can

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
so it doesn't really seem like he can

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.210 
so it doesn't really seem like he can
hold<00:04:48.360> them<00:04:48.569> right<00:04:49.199> here<00:04:49.470> at<00:04:49.710> all

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
hold them right here at all

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.760 
hold them right here at all
it's<00:04:50.699> kind<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:50.970> tricky<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.630> like<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.500> said<00:04:52.560> I'm

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's kind of tricky and like I said I'm

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.249 
it's kind of tricky and like I said I'm
not<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:52.949> huge<00:04:53.340> fan<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.819> head<00:04:54.150> sculpt<00:04:54.660> one

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
not a huge fan of this head sculpt one

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.480 
not a huge fan of this head sculpt one
of<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.410> first<00:04:55.620> things<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.949> did<00:04:56.009> when<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.310> got

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
of the first things I did when I got

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.320 
of the first things I did when I got
this<00:04:56.699> guy's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
this guy's

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.689 
this guy's
I<00:04:57.360> took<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:58.020> world<00:04:58.229> war<00:04:58.410> two<00:04:58.699> ultimate

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
I took the world war two ultimate

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.300 
I took the world war two ultimate
Captain<00:05:00.479> America<00:05:00.930> figure<00:05:01.229> and<00:05:01.349> popped<00:05:02.039> this

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
Captain America figure and popped this

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.909 
Captain America figure and popped this
head<00:05:02.610> off<00:05:02.789> and<00:05:03.180> then<00:05:03.360> snuck<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.500> one<00:05:04.740> on

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
head off and then snuck this one on

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.249 
head off and then snuck this one on
right<00:05:05.160> here<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.639> yeah<00:05:05.960> there<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.050> goes

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
right here and yeah there it goes

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.620 
right here and yeah there it goes
I<00:05:07.880> don't<00:05:08.880> know<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:08.970> think<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.270> looks<00:05:09.479> pretty

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
I don't know I think this looks pretty

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.420 
I don't know I think this looks pretty
tight<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:10.110> think<00:05:10.710> this<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:10.949> okay

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
tight I think this is okay

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.370 
tight I think this is okay
this<00:05:12.180> isn't<00:05:12.449> too<00:05:12.539> bad<00:05:12.720> his<00:05:12.870> head<00:05:13.050> looks<00:05:13.289> a

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
this isn't too bad his head looks a

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.020 
this isn't too bad his head looks a
little<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.770> small<00:05:14.039> side<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.490> think<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
little on the small side I think the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.430 
little on the small side I think the
head<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.509> you<00:05:15.960> know<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.259> head<00:05:16.410> right

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
head on this you know this head right

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.710 
head on this you know this head right
here<00:05:16.740> looks<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.070> little<00:05:17.250> on<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.520> big<00:05:17.880> side<00:05:17.940> so<00:05:18.690> I

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
here looks a little on the big side so I

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.060 
here looks a little on the big side so I
don't<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.940> don't<00:05:20.940> know<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.599> I<00:05:21.960> think<00:05:22.800> I've

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
don't know I don't know so I think I've

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.860 
don't know I don't know so I think I've
just<00:05:23.400> continued<00:05:23.880> posing<00:05:24.240> him<00:05:24.360> with<00:05:24.479> this<00:05:24.630> one

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
just continued posing him with this one

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.409 
just continued posing him with this one
right<00:05:24.900> here<00:05:25.349> but<00:05:26.069> for<00:05:26.639> a<00:05:26.699> while<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:26.880> had<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> post

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
right here but for a while I had a post

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.120 
right here but for a while I had a post
like<00:05:27.659> this<00:05:27.870> which<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.409> thought<00:05:28.919> was<00:05:29.039> pretty

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
like this which I thought was pretty

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.540 
like this which I thought was pretty
cool

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
cool

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.360 
cool
but<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.930> think<00:05:31.289> I<00:05:31.320> saw<00:05:31.530> in<00:05:31.650> it<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:31.949> iam<00:05:32.190> reg

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
but and I think I saw in it and iam reg

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.969 
but and I think I saw in it and iam reg
do<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.759> first<00:05:33.150> anyway<00:05:33.659> so<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:34.409> articulation

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
do that first anyway so the articulation

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.339 
do that first anyway so the articulation
of<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.130> figure<00:05:35.190> is<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.669> he<00:05:36.090> does<00:05:36.360> move<00:05:36.659> his

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
of the figure is that he does move his

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.460 
of the figure is that he does move his
head<00:05:37.470> moves<00:05:37.710> up<00:05:38.030> down<00:05:39.030> very<00:05:39.449> far<00:05:39.690> side<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.289> side

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
head moves up down very far side to side

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.469 
head moves up down very far side to side
he<00:05:40.650> has<00:05:40.770> ball<00:05:41.039> jointed<00:05:41.370> shoulders<00:05:41.820> this<00:05:42.360> is

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
he has ball jointed shoulders this is

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.540 
he has ball jointed shoulders this is
actually<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.960> same<00:05:43.199> exact<00:05:43.560> body<00:05:43.860> as<00:05:44.190> the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
actually the same exact body as the

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.760 
actually the same exact body as the
shield<00:05:45.000> agent<00:05:45.630> with<00:05:45.840> just<00:05:46.229> some<00:05:46.380> altered

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
shield agent with just some altered

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.589 
shield agent with just some altered
parts<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> guess<00:05:47.729> it's<00:05:47.880> not<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.030> same<00:05:48.330> exact

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
parts so I guess it's not the same exact

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.510 
parts so I guess it's not the same exact
body<00:05:48.930> but<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:49.770> know<00:05:49.889> if<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.070> were<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.280> give<00:05:50.490> a

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
body but you know if I were to give a

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.100 
body but you know if I were to give a
comparison<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.210> SHIELD<00:05:51.479> agent<00:05:51.659> I<00:05:51.960> don't

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
comparison to a SHIELD agent I don't

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.600 
comparison to a SHIELD agent I don't
know<00:05:52.169> what<00:05:52.349> SHIELD<00:05:52.650> agent<00:05:52.800> should<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.159> use<00:05:53.370> with

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
know what SHIELD agent should I use with

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.600 
know what SHIELD agent should I use with
SHIELD<00:05:53.909> agent<00:05:54.030> oh<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.659> know<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:56.539> got<00:05:57.539> you<00:05:57.570> it<00:05:58.610> on

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
SHIELD agent oh I know I got you it on

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.959 
SHIELD agent oh I know I got you it on
America<00:06:00.150> though<00:06:00.780> so<00:06:01.409> yeah<00:06:01.740> there's<00:06:02.130> you<00:06:02.820> could

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
America though so yeah there's you could

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.580 
America though so yeah there's you could
see<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.180> shield<00:06:03.449> agents<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.990> same<00:06:04.229> thing

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
see the shield agents the same thing

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.680 
see the shield agents the same thing
they<00:06:05.099> did<00:06:05.340> change<00:06:05.639> you<00:06:06.060> know<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.389> sleeves

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
they did change you know the sleeves

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.959 
they did change you know the sleeves
right<00:06:06.960> here<00:06:07.430> so<00:06:08.430> you<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:08.639> see<00:06:08.759> that's

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
right here so you can see that's

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.270 
right here so you can see that's
different<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.570> little<00:06:10.050> bit<00:06:10.320> less<00:06:10.560> articulation

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
different a little bit less articulation

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.770 
different a little bit less articulation
actually<00:06:11.669> quite<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.849> bit<00:06:12.000> less<00:06:12.150> articulation

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
actually quite a bit less articulation

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.450 
actually quite a bit less articulation
over<00:06:12.960> there<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.440> then<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.830> boots<00:06:14.039> of<00:06:14.190> course

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
over there and then the boots of course

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.610 
over there and then the boots of course
are<00:06:14.610> different<00:06:14.969> so<00:06:15.690> these<00:06:15.810> are<00:06:15.990> bulkier<00:06:16.530> he

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
are different so these are bulkier he

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.350
