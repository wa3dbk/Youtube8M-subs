00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.240
 of real 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.240
 making the bill up number 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.579

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.260
 You guys play a lot of fun way. 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.320
 the name of the game level try to pronounce 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.820
 because it is so tense without much time has 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 that's too much I'm going to get right to the point 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.610
 because I'm already trying to record for the 5th 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.829
 Sesma you're difficult this is it, I'll talk 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.780
 about graphics gameplay intelligence 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.690
 artificial I will comment on the story 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'll talk about the team powers and price 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.949
 One thing only if you throw yourself up. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.409
 to buy or download repeated 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.520
 then stay tuned 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.560

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
 You're still watching this video for 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.330
 see if it is worth downloading or not? 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.430
 play and I'll tell you not to 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.299
 will have whoever embarked on this video 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.240
 because the game itself is a sport and if I 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.189
 play one of the chapters would be singles 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 Do you understand what happened in the 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.890
 Well, good stuff, it's okay. 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.340
 The game is not so heavy, is not it good? 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.229
 you with a setup a computer 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.770
 gives reasonable to run quiet game 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.329
 OK 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.700
 if you are in doubt whether you will or not 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.219
 run your configuration where I 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.920
 I'll tell you, ok let's talk about the 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.670
 game graphic is good is ok 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.159
 game was released in 2007 and the chart 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.749
 it is good is good is better better 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.299
 that many there today 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.759
 the gameplay is good too, you only have 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.280
 you set up the keyboard on the keyboard 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.799
 mouse is a little confused there 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.810
 artificial intelligence of the enemy 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.000
 most bound in that what is the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.180
 some are kinda at some point 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.850
 clever years but only a few is the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 game history pay attention to 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.040
 Game history is about business 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.350
 of religion these things rather than sitting 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 about god having created the eldest son 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.470
 then the firstborn does not know what business 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 Barely There you will know history will 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.680
 see that he wants to get out of this 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.599
 arrest of a so-called box to be able to 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 to rule the world to annihilate a world 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.969
 destroy the world 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.409
 Tatá answered and it's up to us the team. 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:50.870
 generic or jericho I do not know, it 's good to talk 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.590
 with the camera to prevent this from happening 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.099
 OK 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.120
 there are seven individuals are seven members 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.870
 in the team 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.219
 each with one with each skill with 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.269
 powers with the gun personality is obvious 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:10.159
 is the price of the game was 40 and so many 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.810
 Real in steam 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.879
 however I went here to confirm to see 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 How much was it gone? 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.840
 the game is no longer in sting it's sad 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.989
 so just time and even criticized 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.419
 supplies the rest is taco translation someone 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.669
 I saw the translation of this game and I 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.049
 I'll leave it at the link description below 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.120
 the video is ok 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.069
 this game is worth downloading 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.299
 it's worth you spending your time with 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.689
 he 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.290
 the game is not recommended recommended is 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:43.549
 for children under 18 because of 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.799
 talks about the religion business is 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.639
 a lot of blood has heavy things understood 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:54.379
 so it was not indicated to me for minors 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.709
 eight years if you have 14 to 15:16 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.199
 I do not know, there you go crazy, you want to play. 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.840
 the game anyway will not let your mother see 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.389
 because otherwise she'll stuff you toast 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.030
 hewn because this time no one 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.069
 monster is she's going to have a suspect's grandfather 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.829
 so just pay attention 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.840
 The game is worth playing if I do not go 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.209
 talk a lot about the team because that 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.159
 it will not be fun and I do not want to take the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.079
 Grace of the game, I just did not bring the 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:24.440
 gameplay because of the sport's reason 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.330
 even because it's a great graphic with 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.020
 great gameplay in intelligence 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.520
 artificial in is the story is great is e 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.280
 When loading game, please 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.830
 attention in this business here that will not 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.590
 Always win when loading 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 the game for the next next chapter 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.949
 phase will tell a summary of what 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.349
 happened in there where is the story 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.539
 of the game understood the game will pass 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.420
 it's usually obvious not to mention you 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.900
 will read but there is the main story 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.690
 vital part in the time you have 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.030
 loading you're good you expect to read 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.440
 and then continue then it's ok then 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.890
 I hope you liked it here. 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.590
 What a horrible deal I made for you. 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.480
 video here for you guys to call negative 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.800
 way a bastard I'm going to take the game 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.210
 my computer now because I think 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.180
 I already used it 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.120
 was a was great game was a good one 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.790
 I play the story game I go 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.170
 add a little extra is 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.550
 as I said 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.250
 every time we finish a 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.780
 chapter we're going to be people 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.690
 enter the portal that we will change 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.560
 to another 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.620
 say another time there that will have new 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:43.430
 individuals will have new enemies and each 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.900
 enemy is worse than the other is 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.850
 so that's all I had to talk about 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.500
 I do not have much more to say 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.530
 I tried to record this shit here by 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.990
 tenth three should be used instead I do not 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.160
 I can record more 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.250
 Fucking new here, I'm going to break the 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.680
 computer and I will kill you all are 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.810
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.820
 down the game will then leave the description 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.120
 video here I leave all that 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.820
 You need to pay for that game. It 's a great game. 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.160
 It's worth it, yes, and if I could judge 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.730
 have a score for the game even not 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.860
 being sworn in this shit only a gamer 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:26.840
 much experience 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:28.670
 I would give about 15 95 there the 0,5 sodré 0,5 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:35.450
 row is due to lack of intelligence 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:38.150
 artificial is by the exit and there lies 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.730
 little things there to win, I will not say 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:46.000
 many things will know is a good game 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:49.000
 I hope you liked basso and e 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 was
