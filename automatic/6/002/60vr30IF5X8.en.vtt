00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.899
 and good states here tells you media 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.549
 I bring gameplay of white points and as 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.540
 you are watching wow the kinds of water and 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.820
 willy's classes 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.980
 many people I see the comments and 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.889
 more and more that I do not know what mania you have 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.720
 of willy for us your classes and I do not know what 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.090
 and with what advantages is better and I do not know what 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.120
 I do not know how many when I do not know if there 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.590
 let's always say what gameplays with the 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.170
 same weapons I would say good look at my 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.210
 only five classes or ten classes are 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.130
 These are not, but as you know, your ship 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.660
 empress as practically all 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.770
 weapons then good because every time 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.750
 I have one I have a different class 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.670
 good is more always a game will end 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.410
 I usually change something of some of my 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.060
 classes simply for by mariana or 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.500
 because it does not occur to me to always use 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.810
 the same then 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180
 I think you can see from my classes 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.870
 good in each group if you are a little 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.160
 you have payments then at the beginning of each 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.620
 company read my classes at the beginning of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.000
 every video comes out fast my classes works 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 so I'm going to use it even if I do not 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.559
 every time you die the class that 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.270
 you take with the advantages with the grenades 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.530
 and all that then well you can 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.470
 fix there but you do not need to make a 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.360
 exclusive video teaching in my classes 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 because at 5 minutes good it's more like 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.390
 your video base already in my class will be 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.250
 totally different is so it does not have 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.200
 No sense, but well, I can 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.869
 say more or less that I always carry only 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.840
 They carried hard line or bulletproof vest 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.610
 or something similar and then I also want 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.649
 always carry hard or scavenger and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270
 then dexterity is the only thing I can 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.670
 say then what always took 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.410
 stunners but if you do not tell anything 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 I like it more and then yes, there are 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.550
 be in plan change as I know 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.460
 carry last 4 2 Granada betis 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 decent know techno here could we 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 say nothing that was always the same but not 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.530
 good going back a bit to the gameplay 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.810
 I'm playing with the scorpion and I'm going 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.340
 for me a bonus would say that the worst I assumed 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.380
 because I was young do not know how what 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.600
 I already have a little more caught the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.320
 Quiet but this weapon does not stop me 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.369
 to convince 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.570
 I think I'd say it's the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.520
 worse for me at least 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.200
 least I like it has a lot 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.659
 a lot of cadence or instead you can 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.780
 stop balance of incredible speed 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.479
 but of course you stay very fast 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.649
 it does not hurt the shelves too much 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.060
 they have their problems I do not just 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.840
 convince me personally is not a 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.549
 weapon that today would use and in fact good 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.019
 not using anything other than to 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.489
 I could teach an example with this weapon 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.569
 to see if such and to try the one that already 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.549
 you know I like to try a lot of 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.700
 weapons and now they already keep helicopter 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.069
 not because then he was good here 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.569
 playing with this bc4 weapon on one side and 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.549
 how do you like them as I am 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.260
 bringing gameplays the other day enrique 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.090
 yes with which is axis in a way that if 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.739
 with the other form has only employs 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.620
 knife that you saw yesterday that took me 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.480
 from the swarm to knife the other time of 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.310
 pink knife to the stage seeing that yes 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.290
 says four on one side with the scorpion 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.470
 that nobody uses for another streak of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 15 here with my gun so it's a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.819
 game that we say is pretty 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:59.239
 pretty good the truth and c4 over here 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.650
 pure bread show time ago gives me 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.639
 like the other one here and another one 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.260
 ahead like six times a game that 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.519
 It is the moment of the broken by our 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.019
 third time is the fourth time it happens 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.269
 by that area of the map and the eye and 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.409
 four chinchín chin chin chín in the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.000
 truth is that it is a game that is 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.230
 super showy look good you said 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.609
 Now that I'm up lately, I'm 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.469
 trying to make them more like seen 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.540
 makes you see more first because it's like a 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.489
 I play in plant 4 on the one hand I work 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 for another with another low not so much because 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.030
 I take the measure and do not know us 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.069
 have unlocked 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 but good that if I work that if grenade 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.090
 What if this way with the shotgun that 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 always here with something else streak of 20 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.799
 with the gun pim pam on the one hand here 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.090
 you see that it is an authentic massacre is already 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.969
 that taking those those because I 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.799
 was running 64 without bullets and other and 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.290
 so and so and my dogs killing let's go 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.239
 but as strangers here I was already 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.189
 to get almost the next one the next 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.989
 streak which would have meant that if you 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.389
 you take out the helicopter you're practically 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.129
 one forgives a low to get you out of the ub 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.349
 saadistas to two or three from almost 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.060
 get the dogs out so come super 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.440
 super super good 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.050
 to last a little longer the games 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.370
 but obviously if you kill a lot that 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.890
 thing to the other I do not know how to kill much 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.420
 the game ends is what there is and for the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.520
 fourth or fifth time he goes through that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.170
 always always return to the same area 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.480
 at the same place you see where the people are 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.250
 here uploaded because I did not want them 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.870
 start the dogs I did not even know where 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.850
 get in and I say mother of mine please 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.530
 imagine that they kill me is a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.720
 sniper there is no one please 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.700
 he and he gets angry but but very much not 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.220
 I say but what is going to be the following 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.060
 there is dressing or the head of a streak of 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.979
 already 12 25 125 94 maybe with the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.910
 weapon that you see my c4 and the 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.190
 game 37 0 and why good because 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.450
 finished the game is not who knows what 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.770
 what would have happened 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.530
 so one that you have seen a piece 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.880
 of gameplay that the truth is that I 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.860
 swells kill and in a pretty way 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.570
 spectacular and nobody liked the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.940
 video vote it if you have any 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.530
 advice anything by rule that 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.360
 discuss and say and others but down on 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.620
 the comments and nothing the classes already 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.450
 you know at the beginning of each video the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.680
 you can see so you can have an eye and 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.710
 see you in the next greetings to 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.710
 everyone
