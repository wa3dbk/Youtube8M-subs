00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
about that I'm assuming what the test

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.209 
about that I'm assuming what the test
would<00:00:35.340> prove<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.719> am<00:00:37.110> capable<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.890> driving

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
would prove that I am capable of driving

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
would prove that I am capable of driving
a<00:00:38.610> car<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> clinical<00:00:41.820> test<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
a car this is a clinical test of a

a car this is a clinical test of a
person's<00:00:44.100> ability<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:46.559> drive<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
person's ability to drive this is a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.410 
person's ability to drive this is a

strength<00:00:52.260> range<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.010> motion<00:00:53.489> there's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.829> HMAS

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
strength range of motion there's a HMAS

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.880 
strength range of motion there's a HMAS
in<00:00:56.039> nature<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:58.230> bottom<00:00:58.710> line

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
in nature and then the bottom line

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.100 
in nature and then the bottom line
there's<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.370> there's<00:00:59.730> nothing<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:04.369> okay

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
there's no there's nothing there okay

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.760 
there's no there's nothing there okay
this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:07.619> important<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.510> we<00:01:09.510> have

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
this is very important because we have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
this is very important because we have
folks<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> community<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.880> aging<00:01:12.390> or

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
folks in a community that are aging or

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
who may have had an illness or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
who may have had an illness or
disability<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.000> they're<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.200> fit

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
disability and they're not as fit

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
disability and they're not as fit
they're<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.220> strong<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.630> used<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.960> be

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
they're not as strong as they used to be

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
they're not as strong as they used to be
perhaps<00:01:19.860> their<00:01:20.659> memory<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.369> declining<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
perhaps their memory is declining and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
perhaps their memory is declining and
it's<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.659> important<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.320> able<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's very important that they be able to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
it's very important that they be able to
continue<00:01:27.150> driving<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.990> safe<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> road

continue driving and be safe on the road

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
continue driving and be safe on the road
it's<00:01:29.189> critical<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> everybody<00:01:30.180> safety<00:01:30.570> not

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's critical to everybody safety not
