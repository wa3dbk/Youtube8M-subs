Honda motor the pipe looks like it's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
Honda motor the pipe looks like it's
some<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.660> aftermarket<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
some kind of an aftermarket thing it

some kind of an aftermarket thing it
looks<00:00:50.820> pretty<00:00:51.059> nice<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.370> motor<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> sweet

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
looks pretty nice the motor is a sweet

looks pretty nice the motor is a sweet
tech<00:00:54.870> upgrade<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:57.090> least<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> hope<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
tech upgrade I at least I hope it is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.170 
tech upgrade I at least I hope it is
it's<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.039> stickers<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's got stickers on it and this and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's got stickers on it and this and
that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
that
I<00:01:02.090> guess<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> upgrades<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.960> 3000<00:01:04.769> bucks

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I guess that upgrades about 3000 bucks

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.120 
I guess that upgrades about 3000 bucks
so<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.960> why<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> had<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> trade<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> farm

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that's why I had to trade the farm

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
so that's why I had to trade the farm
because<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> said<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> sweet<00:01:09.270> tech

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because they said it was a sweet tech

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.310 
because they said it was a sweet tech
upgrade

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
upgrade

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280 
upgrade
I<00:01:10.350> talked<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> sweet<00:01:11.549> tech<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.810> said<00:01:13.049> there's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I talked to sweet tech they said there's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.330 
I talked to sweet tech they said there's
really<00:01:13.439> no<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> knowing<00:01:15.290> they<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.920> marks

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

American pattern it's easier for me to
get<00:01:53.810> American<00:01:54.810> pattern<00:01:55.049> wheels<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.950> I'll

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
get American pattern wheels but I'll

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.490
