my first step is go ahead and lower the
exhaust<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> wave<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.489> give

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
exhaust and get it out of a wave to give

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
exhaust and get it out of a wave to give
us<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:32.940> working<00:00:33.300> room<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.410> can

alright<00:01:05.309> once<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:05.670> threads<00:01:05.880> cleaned

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
alright once we have our threads cleaned

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
alright once we have our threads cleaned
out<00:01:06.330> we'll<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.750> ahead<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> the

out we'll go ahead and use one of the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
out we'll go ahead and use one of the
hitch<00:01:08.040> bolts<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.670> sure<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> run<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
hitch bolts to make sure we can run the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
hitch bolts to make sure we can run the
bolts<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.560> older<00:01:10.799> vehicle<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.640> more

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bolts in the older vehicle is the more

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.890 
bolts in the older vehicle is the more
time<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> clean<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
time this will take to clean out the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.840 
time this will take to clean out the
threads<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> may<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.310> thread

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
threads and you may have to use a thread

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.930 
threads and you may have to use a thread
tap<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> help<00:01:15.450> clean<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> threads

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.860 

before<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.030> lift<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.270> hitch<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:26.570> in<00:01:26.720> position

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
before we lift a hitch up in position

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.260 
before we lift a hitch up in position
it's<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:28.100> good<00:01:28.250> idea<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.580> remove<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.120> heat

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
it's a good idea to remove the heat

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.900 
it's a good idea to remove the heat
shield<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.810> put<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:30.320> back<00:01:30.410> up<00:01:30.470> later<00:01:30.830> or<00:01:31.160> in

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
shield and put it back up later or in

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.770 
shield and put it back up later or in
this<00:01:32.000> case<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.330> looks<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:32.570> we<00:01:32.630> have<00:01:32.720> just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
this case it looks like we have just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.600 
this case it looks like we have just
enough<00:01:33.110> room<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.770> we'll<00:01:33.890> just<00:01:34.070> go<00:01:34.190> ahead<00:01:34.400> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
enough room that we'll just go ahead and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.910 
enough room that we'll just go ahead and
bend<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.880> either<00:01:35.090> way<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:36.440> install<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
bend it either way and then install the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.010 
bend it either way and then install the
hitch<00:01:37.360> now<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.510> hitch<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.780> gonna<00:01:38.900> be<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
hitch now this hitch is gonna be a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.080 
hitch now this hitch is gonna be a
really<00:01:39.230> tight<00:01:39.470> fit<00:01:39.680> between<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.580> frame<00:01:40.850> rails

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
really tight fit between the frame rails

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.730 
really tight fit between the frame rails
so<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.750> definitely<00:01:41.900> won't<00:01:42.170> have<00:01:42.320> X<00:01:42.470> set<00:01:42.650> of

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
so you definitely won't have X set of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.090 
so you definitely won't have X set of
hands<00:01:42.920> help<00:01:43.220> hold<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.060> up<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.270> place<00:01:44.510> in<00:01:45.100> this

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
hands help hold it up in place in this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.860 
hands help hold it up in place in this
case<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.430> took<00:01:46.550> her<00:01:46.670> driver's<00:01:46.970> side<00:01:47.090> push<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
case we took her driver's side push it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.840 
case we took her driver's side push it
most<00:01:48.050> way<00:01:48.260> in<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.800> then<00:01:49.460> worked<00:01:49.730> our

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
most way in and then worked our

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470 
most way in and then worked our
passenger<00:01:50.270> side<00:01:50.300> up<00:01:50.630> into<00:01:50.810> place<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:52.580> then<00:01:53.330> we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
passenger side up into place and then we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.890 
passenger side up into place and then we
installed<00:01:53.810> our<00:01:53.960> bolts<00:01:54.700> will<00:01:55.700> install<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.660> 12

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
installed our bolts will install the 12

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.990 
installed our bolts will install the 12
millimeter<00:01:57.290> bolts<00:01:57.590> into<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.430> frame<00:01:58.460> along

with the matching conical tooth washers

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.680 
with the matching conical tooth washers
we'll<00:02:01.430> make<00:02:01.580> sure<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.820> T's<00:02:02.030> on<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> complet<00:02:02.600> with

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
washers go up towards the hitch we did

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.490 
washers go up towards the hitch we did
one<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.510> each<00:02:08.630> tie<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.840> help<00:02:09.050> hold<00:02:09.260> the<00:02:09.350> hitch

one on each tie to help hold the hitch
up<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.040> then<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.280> will<00:02:10.369> still<00:02:10.580> install<00:02:10.910> the
