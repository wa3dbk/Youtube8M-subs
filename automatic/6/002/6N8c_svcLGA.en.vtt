00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 I'm here in the studio, it's going to be in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:10.290
 I 'm going to start recording the material 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.700
 of the single from the streets where 2012 and I go 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.700
 fucking pass that building 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.820
 the idea of recording music and making 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.480
 making off for people to follow 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 the day after day we ended up showing 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.270
 some videos composing essay tooth only 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 me and marcus earl dayna was not all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.620
 world that has contact with this type of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.949
 this process is a song we 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.550
 decided to get her to record 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.530
 officially before CB and form the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.130
 different project is not only to record 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.570
 a single is more record or everyone 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:27.380
 out of the media around the mouth of a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:30.150
 my mother I'm recording. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.970
 tap gravatá button being filmed 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.460
 by this process of creating this 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.229
 Special music happened first with 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.940
 some ideas lucas sales the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.570
 composition process is usually born 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.100
 of a guitar riff without lyrics 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 usually the last thing we 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.729
 so does a guitar riff an idea of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 drums 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.399
 so in the case of the seed of madness I had 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 the idea of ​​riffs I compose ten rivers 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.110
 for example house in one with one between 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.610
 they take the test personnel to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 people are riding that transforming 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.710
 that in the unit is quiet and is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.780
 conscious our box 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.120
 focus on the language will also 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.120
 receive not only cassia paula file 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.130
 I already had a song to record 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.980
 but then suddenly out of nowhere on a website and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.790
 surged single meaning to make music 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.100
 New for this project already goes there 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.290
 develop our music in one month and one 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.380
 something that we do a lot until we 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:47.350
 because of the style is to take a mexidinha 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:50.060
 rhythmic part went well 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.260
 I honestly think it comes down to music 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.540
 more complex than it has done so far, it is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.470
 well pie was not so zonamentos much 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.270
 down in setbacks only an influence 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.410
 we all like us a lot 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.770
 to play Swedish band does not have a line 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.560
 in a straight line and it turned out half that 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.780
 this influence of the people of the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.350
 kind of noticeable in this song of mine. 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.810
 to see 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.440
 luizinho I think it went well in the galas 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.140
 something there the sheikha of the province 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.850
 music that sometimes they still in the mood 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.310
 suddenly the other break is you have one 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.300
 break but soon the song comes back in time 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.220
 previous 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.690
 so we really like to use 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.150
 this is to give a different climate in the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.570
 comments to differentiate what the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.970
 People usually do not care, and I will. 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.800
 ask him to open a fish or redo 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.290
 this whole new favor part are 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.600
 I think the guy who calls me the most 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.390
 attention in this song because face to the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.290
 face looks like 111 people playing music 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.290
 all know 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.620
 Jorge, this song is what I said 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.780
 I have is this way I really like it is always 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.190
 couple that the battery is doing with the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.169
 search context 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:27.320
 in the case of soybean with which the low and the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.930
 guitar to do on this song is 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.479
 I did not imagine but it ended up going I use 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:39.199
 much effect dishes it right is splashs 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.479
 del chairá in the whole song you can see 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.110
 that all those bean sprouts getting married 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.470
 with soil and prevent details is 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.160
 lines to understand the context of the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.560
 music paraense fit battery then 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.479
 so I just take a seat for 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.010
 me to put the battery inside the 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.360
 context of the stock market that does not 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.360
 random details 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.260
