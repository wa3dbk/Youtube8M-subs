see<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.230> progress<00:00:22.439> from<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> beginning<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
see my progress from the beginning of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.950 
see my progress from the beginning of
the<00:00:23.760> process<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> very<00:00:24.600> end<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the process to the very end of the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
the process to the very end of the
process<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.500> thought<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.980> really

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
process I thought it would be really

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
process I thought it would be really
neat<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> record<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.269> each<00:00:27.390> day<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
neat to have a record for each day and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.890 
neat to have a record for each day and
then<00:00:28.590> also<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> end<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.910> will<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.570> able<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
then also at the end I will be able to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.840 
then also at the end I will be able to
take<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.410> section<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> each<00:00:32.160> video<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
take up section of each video and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.760

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
actually progress all the way through my

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.770 
actually progress all the way through my
transformation<00:00:35.120> frame-by-frame<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.660> you'll

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
transformation frame-by-frame so you'll

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080 
transformation frame-by-frame so you'll
be<00:00:36.870> able<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.000 
beginning and what I look like at the
end<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> day<00:00:42.120> five<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.870> said<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.410> did

the<00:01:00.809> refrigerator<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> things

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the refrigerator and got all the things

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
the refrigerator and got all the things
I<00:01:02.129> wished<00:01:02.399> I'd<00:01:02.579> eaten<00:01:02.789> before<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.210> started<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I wished I'd eaten before I started the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
I wished I'd eaten before I started the
diet<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.939> had<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> bite<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> each<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> those<00:01:06.630> and

diet and had a bite of each of those and
I<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.430> because

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
I really think that that was because

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
I really think that that was because
last<00:01:09.900> time<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.439> did<00:01:10.650> ophtho<00:01:11.010> fest<00:01:11.159> once

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
last time I I did ophtho fest once
before<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.000> successful<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
before I was very successful with it and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
before I was very successful with it and
I<00:01:13.619> told<00:01:13.830> myself<00:01:13.950> oh<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.549> okay<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.659> be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I told myself oh it's okay I will be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.149 
I told myself oh it's okay I will be
successful<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.619> always<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
successful because I always know the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
successful because I always know the
food<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.820> always<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
food is there I can always go back to it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
food is there I can always go back to it
it'll<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> fine<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> was

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it'll be fine and this time I was

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
it'll be fine and this time I was
telling<00:01:21.180> myself<00:01:21.390> no<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.890> back

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
telling myself no you're not going back

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
telling myself no you're not going back
to<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.250> food<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.850> doing<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> anymore

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to that food I'm not doing that anymore

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
to that food I'm not doing that anymore
and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> part<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.009> me<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and I think there was a part of me that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
and I think there was a part of me that
was<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.820> panicky<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
was just a little panicky about it so I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
was just a little panicky about it so I
went<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:28.920> last<00:01:29.130> taste<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
went to that one last taste so I kind of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
went to that one last taste so I kind of
switch<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> way<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.470> thinking<00:01:31.680> about

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
switch the way that I'm thinking about

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.660 
switch the way that I'm thinking about
things<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> am<00:01:34.380> saying<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.369> never

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
things and now I am saying I'm never

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
things and now I am saying I'm never
going<00:01:35.939> back<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.270> using<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.930> food<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> same

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
going back to using that food the same
