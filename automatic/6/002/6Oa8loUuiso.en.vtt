00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:09.100
 and already finishing the row 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.100
 we make the three whole 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.100
 chain 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.890
 and the whole point to close and we were 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.410
 to the center of that conchitas ok see how 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 we go 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 ok now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.510
 we raise equal three chains and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.800
 we make the two whole 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.720
 that is missing more to start the conchita 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.460
 remember that here we made a string ok 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.400
 here we are also going to make a chain 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.220
 but let's make half a point where 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.540
 we made the chain in the previous row 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.540
 a chain and we continue 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.530
 3 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.460
 1 2 3 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.580
 we do the same 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.980
 or not 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.750
 23 integers 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.960
 remember the chain the half point 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.240
 and the chain once this is going to stay like this 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.710
 like little little pits like that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 we finished the whole row 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.399
 then we return in a row we are going to 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.700
 make the shells of 3 3 whole three 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.289
 chains three whole a chain and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.299
 we keep doing the following with china 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.579
 in the next one and we're going to do the 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.829
 same conchita of three integers three 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.049
 three whole chains and here's going to have 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.770
 a change we are going to make half a point 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.450
 forgive a half point chain and one 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.789
 chain and we continue doing the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.539
 conchitas this we are going to repeat 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.990
 for four times that is let's say to 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.540
 do 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.080
 these two rows once 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.780
 and again these two rows once 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.790
 more we have the four rows of 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.880
 which spoke to them 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.600
 we make three whole a chain 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 63 integers 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.590
 three chains 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.590
 three whole 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.790
 now we make a separation chain and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.829
 we start from wherever 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 for our hat we 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.030
 We need to have 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.020
 this little group repeated twice more ok 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.620
 they continue weaving up there and we see each other in 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.620
 a while 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.600
 once we have finished all the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.210
 rows 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.390
 because we have a group two groups and 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.850
 three groups we are going to make nine points 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.590
 whole here as we are starting the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.950
 center we 're always going to do half 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.550
 then we raise three integers three 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.740
 forgiveness chains and we do four whole 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.780
 one 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.790
 two 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.450
 3 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.200
 and 4 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.680
 ok we make a separation chain and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's go here let's do 9 integers 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.900
 or two 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.470
 two 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.470
 3 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.300
 4 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.319
 8 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.590
 and nine integers 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.910
 ok a meat separation and we continue 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.270
 making the whole nine 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.730
 one 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.300
 two 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.300
 3 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.909
 or
