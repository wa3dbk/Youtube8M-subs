00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.600
 m 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.030
 and 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.510
 hi how are you I have a question 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.029
 important that I have something thoughtful 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.290
 you know if the angels protect us today 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.570
 day what do you think what a good question 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.780
 course and since I have the bible 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.879
 with me I 'll answer your question 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.199
 if you want please you can look at that 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.449
 says the bible in Hebrews 114 says no 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.850
 they are all spirits for service 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.910
 public sent to serve the favor of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.550
 those who will inherit salvation as 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.250
 you can notice there is clarified first what 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.350
 kind of beings are they say they are 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.559
 spirits and residing of course in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.690
 the spiritual heavens hey but I have 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.809
 another question because it says there are 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.990
 spirits for public service to you 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.570
 what is happening is that the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.549
 angels are not quiet but everything 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.830
 time are always working with 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.810
 something related to an important end 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.630
 let's see it in genesis 19 15 and 16 the frame 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.770
 of circumstances is that God had as 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.409
 purpose to finish 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.840
 to a city for its evil however 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.869
 Jehovah would never allow the good 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.340
 die with the bad so that in that 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.159
 moment to see that there was a family 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.979
 good in that city decided to act 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.979
 to save them and that's why we do not have what 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.229
 what are the verses you are going to read 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.390
 nevertheless when the dawn rose 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.020
 then the angels went to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.880
 reward lot by saying get up take your 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.329
 wife and your two daughters who are 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.520
 here you and your wife's human and the 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.390
 hands of his two daughters and proceeded to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 remove it and place it outside the city 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.409
 you managed to see that they did the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.509
 angels of jehovah if there is said that 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.340
 they went down and they looked for lot and that with their 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.880
 family encouraged them to leave the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.329
 city because God was going to destroy her like this 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.940
 that's why in this case what was the 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.370
 public service they did as notes 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.040
 do God's will and support his 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.490
 purpose in this case saving this 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.400
 family 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.500
 I want to show you another example so that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 you see that angels always have that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.960
 purpose 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.970
 let's see please kill 28 5 and 7 and 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.830
 then lucas 22 43 in the first case what 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.080
 what are we going to see is how an angel came 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.380
 an important message after the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.600
 death of jesus read it please but the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.240
 angel taking the word said to the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.630
 women do not fear because I know they are looking for 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.430
 Jesus that was fixed on a tree and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.830
 go quickly and tell your disciples 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.100
 that he has been raised from among 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.580
 dead and look forward to you 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.000
 galilea there they were, look , I saw it 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.240
 said that message gave in this case this 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.580
 angel who gave a message confirming that 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.890
 Jesus had been killed and in addition they 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.810
 He told these women that they should go to 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.000
 where the disciples and communicate the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.790
 resurrection of jesus 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.910
 very well note the purpose with which 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.180
 this angel did this work supporting the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.120
 purpose of God in this case to gather 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.300
 back to the apostles and encourage them 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.730
 the other verses say before that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.310
 I want you to know that Jesus though 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.250
 he was a perfect man the son of god 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.520
 He also needed comfort and for 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.680
 that now yes read the verse says 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.220
 Then an angel appeared to him from 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.910
 sky strengthened him so that in this 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.250
 case the angel strengthened Jesus this is 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.380
 so that with these examples and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.600
 many more than there are in the bible you will give 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.020
 realize that everything the angels do 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.150
 is in favor of God's purpose as 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.430
 describe the original words in 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.220
 Hebrew and Greek for angel they are 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.190
 messengers because they carry a message of 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.829
 salvation in favor of the people and today 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.900
 It is evident that they are also helping 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.570
 the servants of God to do the work more 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.580
 important the preaching of the good 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.099
 new all over the world 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.400
 and thank you very much for the explanation 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.979
 everything has been very clear 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.419
 taste when you want we can analyze 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.419
 another issue if you allow me
