because I do but I'll tell you one

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.020 
because I do but I'll tell you one
reason<00:02:06.450> why<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> didn't<00:02:07.170> put<00:02:07.290> them<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.650> there

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
reason why I didn't put them in there

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.990 
reason why I didn't put them in there
because<00:02:09.110> reason<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.290> there's<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.370> politic<00:02:11.790> Jar

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
because reason is there's a politic Jar

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
because reason is there's a politic Jar
Jar<00:02:12.150> Binks<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.730> they're<00:02:14.730> pretty<00:02:14.910> big<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
Jar Binks and they're pretty big and I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.150 
Jar Binks and they're pretty big and I
think<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:17.850> crowd<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.600> army<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> bit<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
think that would crowd the army a bit so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.800 
think that would crowd the army a bit so
I<00:02:20.790> didn't<00:02:21.360> put<00:02:21.540> them<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.980> but<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:24.360> know

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.449 

so<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.990> was<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.290> pretty<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> did<00:02:29.280> have

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
so that was just pretty but I did have

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.870 
so that was just pretty but I did have
yes<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.680> got<00:02:31.680> some<00:02:31.890> more<00:02:32.010> droid<00:02:32.600> stuff<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:35.670> we

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
yes I got some more droid stuff then we

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.630 
yes I got some more droid stuff then we
got<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:36.959> good<00:02:37.110> mighty<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.500> army<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
got so that's good mighty the army and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.780 
got so that's good mighty the army and
now<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.360> Ballards<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.340> that's<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
now for the Ballards so I think that's a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.410 
now for the Ballards so I think that's a
lot<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.000> them

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
lot of them

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.330 
lot of them
I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.840> that's<00:02:43.110> 67<00:02:43.830> Bell<00:02:44.160> droids<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> that's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I think that's 67 Bell droids so that's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
I think that's 67 Bell droids so that's
one<00:02:48.120> commander<00:02:48.739> there's<00:02:49.739> two<00:02:50.010> droids<00:02:50.360> with

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
one commander there's two droids with

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.590 
one commander there's two droids with
the<00:02:51.540> old<00:02:51.750> guns<00:02:52.050> um<00:02:52.860> all<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.269> droids<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:56.600> at

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
the old guns um all the droids and at

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.940 
the old guns um all the droids and at
the<00:02:57.900> back<00:02:58.049> we<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:59.390> some<00:03:00.500> pilots<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.799> some

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the back we have some pilots and some

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.970 
the back we have some pilots and some
security<00:03:02.519> droids<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.690> um<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.290> didn't<00:03:04.680> notice

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
security droids now um I didn't notice

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.910
