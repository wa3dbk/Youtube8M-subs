00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210 
definitely go into the back of the net
and<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.450> course<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> keeper<00:01:52.170> making<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.920> stop

and look at that dramatic safe there

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
and look at that dramatic safe there
from<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> keeper<00:01:55.170> parting<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.219> out

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
nothing came from the corridor but they

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
nothing came from the corridor but they
did<00:01:58.049> push<00:01:58.290> forward<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.100> these<00:01:59.189> guys

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
did push forward and look at these guys

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.999 
did push forward and look at these guys
we<00:01:59.640> gave<00:01:59.909> away<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.479> penalty<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.590> course<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
we gave away a penalty and of course you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
we gave away a penalty and of course you
can<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> Mander<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> give<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> penalty

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can see the Mander that give the penalty

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
can see the Mander that give the penalty
away<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.710> almost<00:02:05.159> I'm<00:02:05.340> surprised<00:02:05.700> he

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
away was not almost I'm surprised he

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
away was not almost I'm surprised he
wasn't<00:02:06.060> booked<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.899> he's<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> captain<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
wasn't booked but he's the captain and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.619 
wasn't booked but he's the captain and
he<00:02:07.890> gave<00:02:08.069> away<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.310> penalty<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> really

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
he gave away a penalty which is really

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.960 
he gave away a penalty which is really
frustrating<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:11.580> happens<00:02:11.760> sometimes

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
frustrating but that happens sometimes

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940 
frustrating but that happens sometimes

you can see from paris there fortunately
and<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.300> course<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.599> cupid<00:02:30.930> makes<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> save

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and the different there clears that one

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 
and the different there clears that one
out<00:02:32.880> rather<00:02:33.150> dramatically<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.349> go<00:02:34.500> into

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
out rather dramatically what we go into

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.100 
out rather dramatically what we go into
the<00:02:34.800> first<00:02:35.190> half<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.390> nil<00:02:36.599> 11

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the first half as you can see one nil 11

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.470 
the first half as you can see one nil 11
up<00:02:37.319> which<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.519> frustrating<00:02:39.090> because<00:02:39.209> we

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
up which is very frustrating because we

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
up which is very frustrating because we
took<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> lead<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.260> definitely

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
took the lead and we definitely

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
took the lead and we definitely
dominated<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.640> see<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.150> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
dominated as you can see there if it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.970 
dominated as you can see there if it
wasn't<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> penalty<00:02:43.379> because<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.830> had

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
wasn't for the penalty because they had

dictate the game a little better in the
second<00:02:57.000> half<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.209> look<00:02:57.450> at<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> past

second half one look at the past
internati<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.890> flips<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.220> over<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
internati what flips it over the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.770 
internati what flips it over the
defendant<00:02:59.849> takes<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.180> shot<00:03:00.360> off<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> course

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
defendant takes a shot off and of course

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
defendant takes a shot off and of course
the<00:03:01.470> keeper<00:03:01.890> there<00:03:02.099> would<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.640> definitely

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the keeper there would have definitely

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.360 
the keeper there would have definitely
been<00:03:03.390> rooted<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.959> spot<00:03:04.079> because<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:05.099> came

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
been rooted to the spot because it came

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.800 
been rooted to the spot because it came
off<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.730> defender<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.239> went<00:03:06.420> out<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.569> thought

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
off the defender and went out I thought

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
off the defender and went out I thought
it<00:03:06.959> would<00:03:07.019> occur<00:03:07.290> into<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> far<00:03:07.829> corner<00:03:07.860> but

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
it would occur into the far corner but

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.610 
it would occur into the far corner but
the<00:03:08.819> past<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.209> corner<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.720> guys<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.319> look<00:03:10.500> at

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the past is corner in guys and look at

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.650 
the past is corner in guys and look at
that<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.829> goes<00:03:11.099> right<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.730> man<00:03:11.970> who<00:03:12.420> makes

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
that it goes right to the man who makes

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.449 
that it goes right to the man who makes
a<00:03:12.840> mistake<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.440> first<00:03:13.650> half<00:03:13.890> giving<00:03:14.280> away

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459

and of course Nana was able to dictate
it<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.139> look<00:03:43.290> at<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.530> van<00:03:44.069> persie<00:03:44.489> gets<00:03:44.670> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it and look at that van persie gets a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.699 
it and look at that van persie gets a
hold<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> hits<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.840> one<00:03:45.959> into<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.470> far

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
corner and of course it did take a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.240 
corner and of course it did take a
deflection<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.900> fact<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.260> think<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.889> see<00:03:50.100> from

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
deflection in fact I think you see from

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.319 
deflection in fact I think you see from
the<00:03:50.310> replay<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.790> took<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> mighty

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
the replay that it took a mighty

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.849 
the replay that it took a mighty
deflection<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.200> felt<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.739> was

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
deflection because I felt like it was

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.039 
deflection because I felt like it was
definitely<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.549> near<00:03:54.180> post<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.690> maybe<00:03:54.930> to

definitely going near post and maybe to

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.449 
definitely going near post and maybe to

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
keep over to have a chance to save it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.190 
keep over to have a chance to save it
maybe<00:03:56.940> what<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.239> still<00:03:57.450> going<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.930> back<00:03:58.079> of

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
maybe what is still going to the back of

I can see we completely dominated the
game<00:05:04.310> even<00:05:04.520> though<00:05:04.700> they<00:05:04.820> did<00:05:05.090> took<00:05:05.270> back<00:05:05.420> a

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.060 
game even though they did took back a
little<00:05:05.660> position<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.710> was<00:05:06.830> pretty<00:05:06.980> much

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
little position and I was pretty much

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.710 
little position and I was pretty much
keeping<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.490> at<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.820> ball<00:05:08.000> into<00:05:08.240> their<00:05:08.510> ass

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
keeping it at the ball into their ass

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.600 
keeping it at the ball into their ass
they<00:05:09.200> have<00:05:09.350> four<00:05:09.590> shots<00:05:09.800> not<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.070> target<00:05:10.310> we<00:05:10.520> had

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
they have four shots not a target we had

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.400 
they have four shots not a target we had
11<00:05:10.820> 10<00:05:11.180> on<00:05:11.300> target<00:05:11.660> forty<00:05:11.960> percent<00:05:12.230> of<00:05:12.350> the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
11 10 on target forty percent of the

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.660 
block or shatters who was ninety percent
in<00:05:14.450> our<00:05:14.540> past<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.930> was<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.170> 78<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.250> we<00:05:16.340> completely

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
in our past it was a 78 so we completely

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.430
