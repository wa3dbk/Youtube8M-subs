you can see that it's kind of thick so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950

the<00:00:35.130> nice<00:00:35.250> thing<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.520> having<00:00:35.910> thick<00:00:36.360> motion

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the nice thing about having thick motion

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040 
the nice thing about having thick motion
it<00:00:37.590> stays<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> body<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.730> longer

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
it stays on the body a little bit longer

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.459 
it stays on the body a little bit longer
so<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.140> rub<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.989> lotion<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so I can rub it in and the lotion is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.049 
so I can rub it in and the lotion is
really<00:00:46.680> good<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> reflexology

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really good for like reflexology

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.900 
really good for like reflexology
treatments<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:49.020> deep<00:00:49.289> tissue<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.610> for

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
treatments or deep tissue but for

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.660 
treatments or deep tissue but for
generalized<00:00:51.449> Swedish<00:00:51.899> massage<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:53.309> doesn't

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
generalized Swedish massage it doesn't

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.279 
generalized Swedish massage it doesn't
stay<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> body<00:00:54.329> long<00:00:54.660> enough<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
stay on the body long enough so you have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
stay on the body long enough so you have
to<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.500> applying<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.820> why<00:00:56.969> oil<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to keep applying it so that's why oil is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740 
to keep applying it so that's why oil is
definitely<00:00:57.989> recommended<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.449> doesn't

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
definitely recommended and it doesn't

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.460 
definitely recommended and it doesn't
have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.350> real<00:01:01.770> greasy<00:01:02.250> feeling<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.290> nice

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
have a real greasy feeling so it's nice

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590 
have a real greasy feeling so it's nice
about<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> lotion<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.119> again<00:01:06.360> it's

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
about the lotion then but again it's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.980 
about the lotion then but again it's
really<00:01:06.689> thick<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.909> can't<00:01:08.909> even<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
really thick I can't even really move it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.399 
really thick I can't even really move it
when<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.990> almost

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
when it's going like this so it's almost

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
when it's going like this so it's almost
feels<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> cream<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.180> one

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
feels like a cream in a way so it's one

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.710 
feels like a cream in a way so it's one
one<00:01:16.409> step<00:01:16.560> below<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> cream<00:01:17.400> I'd<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
one step below a cream I'd say for the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
one step below a cream I'd say for the
lotion<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.380> again<00:01:19.619> massage<00:01:20.009> lotion<00:01:20.369> unscented

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
lotion so again massage lotion unscented

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
lotion so again massage lotion unscented
and<00:01:24.650> there's<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.070> even<00:01:26.369> though<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> says

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and there's it even though it says

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.899 
and there's it even though it says
unscented<00:01:27.240> there's<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.780> mild<00:01:28.229> mild<00:01:28.909> smell

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
unscented there's just a mild mild smell

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.490 
unscented there's just a mild mild smell
I<00:01:29.939> mean<00:01:30.299> someone's<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.750> smell<00:01:31.140> no<00:01:31.320> matter

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
I mean someone's gonna smell no matter

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:42.539 
I mean someone's gonna smell no matter

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.639 

so<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.299> you<00:01:43.390> can<00:01:43.479> see<00:01:43.539> really<00:01:44.079> good<00:01:44.259> for<00:01:44.500> deep

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
so as you can see really good for deep

longer<00:01:51.360> areas<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.539> body<00:01:52.750> probably<00:01:53.259> not

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
longer areas the body probably not

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.160 
longer areas the body probably not
recommended<00:01:54.189> but<00:01:54.909> again<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.390> love<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.689> texture

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
again it's gonna stay in the body a lot

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.160

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
am oil person I love using oil that's

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.280 
am oil person I love using oil that's
probably<00:02:09.700> my<00:02:09.819> favorite<00:02:10.299> out<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.660> oil<00:02:10.840> cream

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
probably my favorite out of oil cream

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.509 
probably my favorite out of oil cream
lotion<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:12.220> oil<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.920> also<00:02:15.160> says

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
lotion is oil and this also says

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:28.130 
lotion is oil and this also says
unscented<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.819> again<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.180> opened<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.840> up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.319 

but<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.310> notice<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.910> there's<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.209> little

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
but what I notice is there's a little

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.140 
but what I notice is there's a little
stopper<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.170> too<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.519> shipping<00:02:33.970> wise

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
stopper in here too so in shipping wise

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.080 
stopper in here too so in shipping wise
it's<00:02:34.720> less<00:02:34.900> likely<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.349> things<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.220> spill

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
it's less likely for things to spill

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.720 
it's less likely for things to spill
that<00:02:37.120> way<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.049> nice<00:02:38.260> safety<00:02:38.829> device

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
that way so that's a nice safety device

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
that way so that's a nice safety device
I'm<00:02:40.629> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> put<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.170> down<00:02:41.319> there

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.080 

it's<00:02:50.159> clear<00:02:50.489> oil

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.229 

and<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.690> feels<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:56.140> little<00:02:56.319> thick<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:01.090> not

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
and it feels a little thick so it's not

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.910 
and it feels a little thick so it's not
going<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.510> run<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.140> body<00:03:02.349> that's<00:03:02.680> nice

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
going to run off the body that's nice

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.710 
going to run off the body that's nice
about<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:06.000> let<00:03:07.000> me<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.239> work<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
about that let me just work it in a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:16.150 
about that let me just work it in a
little<00:03:07.750> bit

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.420 

now<00:03:16.730> myself<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.240> have<00:03:17.420> kind<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.750> hairy<00:03:17.960> arms<00:03:18.650> and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
now myself I have kind of hairy arms and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.890 
now myself I have kind of hairy arms and
I'm<00:03:19.490> not<00:03:19.640> feeling<00:03:19.970> any<00:03:20.150> kind<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.420> pull<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.810> all

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
I'm not feeling any kind of pull at all

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.230 
I'm not feeling any kind of pull at all
when<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:21.650> using<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:25.940> not<00:03:26.180> really

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
when I'm using it but it's not really

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.960 
when I'm using it but it's not really
thin<00:03:26.990> oil<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:27.590> thin<00:03:27.980> oil<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.550> might<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.910> able

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
thin oil so thin oil you might be able

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.720 
thin oil so thin oil you might be able
to<00:03:29.120> get<00:03:29.240> a<00:03:29.270> little<00:03:29.450> bit<00:03:29.660> better<00:03:29.870> Glide<00:03:30.290> with<00:03:30.730> it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
to get a little bit better Glide with it

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.460 
to get a little bit better Glide with it
but<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.450> think<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.930> would<00:03:33.080> definitely<00:03:33.230> be

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
but I think this would definitely be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.250 
but I think this would definitely be
good<00:03:33.680> for<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:33.980> deep<00:03:34.160> tissue<00:03:34.190> or<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:36.110> non

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
good for like deep tissue or for non

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.510 
good for like deep tissue or for non
hairy<00:03:36.950> parts<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:42.890> or<00:03:43.340> being

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
hairy parts and then it's or being

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.070 
hairy parts and then it's or being
pretty<00:03:43.760> good<00:03:43.940> too<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:44.420> it's<00:03:44.570> still<00:03:44.750> staying

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
pretty good too but it's still staying

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:55.630 
pretty good too but it's still staying
on<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.350> body<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.800> was<00:03:46.010> nice<00:03:46.190> about<00:03:46.370> it

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.770 

and<00:03:55.730> I'm<00:03:56.600> not<00:03:56.720> able<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.050> really<00:03:57.350> slip<00:03:57.770> at<00:03:57.920> all

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
and I'm not able to really slip at all

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.520 
and I'm not able to really slip at all
it's<00:03:59.780> also<00:03:59.959> another<00:04:00.350> benefit<00:04:02.020> so<00:04:03.020> definitely

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it's also another benefit so definitely

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.570 
it's also another benefit so definitely
good<00:04:03.709> for<00:04:03.740> deep<00:04:04.100> tissue<00:04:04.870> treatment<00:04:05.870> areas

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
good for deep tissue treatment areas

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.680 
good for deep tissue treatment areas
those<00:04:07.580> specific<00:04:08.090> areas

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 

and<00:04:15.200> really<00:04:15.440> can't<00:04:15.650> smell<00:04:15.920> anything<00:04:16.100> either

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and really can't smell anything either

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.830 
and really can't smell anything either
so<00:04:16.550> again<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.090> says<00:04:17.300> unscented<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:19.840> hardly

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
so again it says unscented and hardly

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.920 
so again it says unscented and hardly
anything<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.830> says<00:04:22.040> non<00:04:22.460> allergenic

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
anything and it says non allergenic

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.230 
anything and it says non allergenic
water<00:04:23.930> dispensable<00:04:24.620> -<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> again<00:04:31.030> kind<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.120> a

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
water dispensable - so again kind of a

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.730 
water dispensable - so again kind of a
thick<00:04:32.480> oil<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:35.260> don't<00:04:36.260> know<00:04:36.320> if<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.530> see

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
thick oil I don't know if you can see

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.060 
thick oil I don't know if you can see
that<00:04:36.950> it's<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:37.910> slowly<00:04:38.330> moving<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.800> it's<00:04:39.950> not

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
that it's just slowly moving so it's not

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.430 
that it's just slowly moving so it's not
going<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.280> run<00:04:40.460> all<00:04:40.670> over<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:41.360> if<00:04:42.140> you're<00:04:42.290> kind

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
going to run all over and if you're kind

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.650 
going to run all over and if you're kind
of<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.650> klutz<00:04:42.890> -<00:04:43.250> you're<00:04:44.030> not<00:04:44.120> gonna<00:04:44.300> spill<00:04:44.630> a

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
of a klutz - you're not gonna spill a

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.060 
of a klutz - you're not gonna spill a
lot<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.230> so<00:04:45.440> that's<00:04:45.620> what's<00:04:45.830> nice<00:04:46.040> about

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
lot of it so that's what's nice about

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.290 
lot of it so that's what's nice about
this<00:04:46.520> kind<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.880> oil<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.400> these<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:50.090> can

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
this kind of oil and with these you can

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.120 
this kind of oil and with these you can
add<00:04:50.570> essential<00:04:50.990> oils<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.740> there<00:04:51.890> too<00:04:52.100> if

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
add essential oils in there too if

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.430 
add essential oils in there too if
you're<00:04:52.460> trained<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.910> Roma<00:04:53.210> therapy<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.260> that's

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
you're trained in Roma therapy so that's

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.350 
you're trained in Roma therapy so that's
another<00:04:54.710> option<00:04:54.980> if<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.430> do<00:04:55.580> want<00:04:55.850> some<00:04:56.090> sense

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
another option if you do want some sense

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.810 
another option if you do want some sense
but<00:04:56.630> again<00:04:57.590> some<00:04:57.830> clients<00:04:58.160> don't<00:04:58.280> like<00:04:58.520> cents

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
but again some clients don't like cents

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.430 
but again some clients don't like cents
that's<00:04:59.120> why<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.510> really<00:04:59.570> beneficial<00:04:59.930> to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
that's why it's really beneficial to

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.790 
that's why it's really beneficial to
have<00:05:00.830> non-scented<00:05:01.990> formulas<00:05:02.990> then<00:05:03.230> just<00:05:03.710> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
have non-scented formulas then just to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.740 
have non-scented formulas then just to
be<00:05:03.920> safe<00:05:04.130> then<00:05:04.430> but<00:05:05.090> if<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> are<00:05:05.420> going<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.660> add

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
be safe then but if you are going to add

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.090 
be safe then but if you are going to add
cents<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.170> it<00:05:06.260> make<00:05:06.410> sure<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.680> label<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100
