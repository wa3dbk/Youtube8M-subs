00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you that's because this z3 is actually a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
you that's because this z3 is actually a
dual<00:01:30.630> SIM<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> guys<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> see

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
dual SIM so if you guys just want to see

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
dual SIM so if you guys just want to see

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
this part here I have a sim one and sim

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
this part here I have a sim one and sim
two<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.950> sim<00:01:38.250> 1<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.140> here's<00:01:40.140> sim<00:01:40.439> 2<00:01:41.090> sim<00:01:42.090> one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
two your sim 1 and here's sim 2 sim one

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
two your sim 1 and here's sim 2 sim one
is<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.689> Hongkong<00:01:43.259> SIM<00:01:43.680> card<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.070> sim<00:01:44.280> 2<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> my

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is my Hongkong SIM card and sim 2 is my

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450 
is my Hongkong SIM card and sim 2 is my
USA<00:01:45.210> SIM<00:01:45.479> card<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.280> have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
USA SIM card and you can see I only have

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.539 
USA SIM card and you can see I only have
data<00:01:47.759> only<00:01:48.659> running<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.369> can

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
data only running on one because you can

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
data only running on one because you can
only<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> give<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> dual<00:01:51.780> sim<00:01:51.990> phone<00:01:52.020> data

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
only get you give a dual sim phone data

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
only get you give a dual sim phone data
only<00:01:52.829> runs<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.579> sim<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.570> pointless

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
only runs on one sim just it's pointless
