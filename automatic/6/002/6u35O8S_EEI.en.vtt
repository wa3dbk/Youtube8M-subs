00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.490
 Professor Lucarelli, how come she is considered one of the leading experts 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.909
 in the protection of historic centers 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.289
 he dedicated his last monographs to the suburbs 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.679
 Belforte a few of you believe 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.019
 the dream of historic centers is harmoniously 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.019
 the elite study reserved small specialist groups 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.899
 but read about you I carried out in the past few years I often found myself 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.410
 ahahah face shocking social and economic realities 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.130
 are those periphery ichio defined see you leave in the belly of the city 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.380
 due to the degradation of women and the gifts of the historic center 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.410
 due to the vaccinations of which they are not directly on 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 established by building speculation 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.690
 it is a title 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 via the green suburban country different from the peripheries due to the expulsion 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.620
 large suburbs imaginary the cornello to paris the thousand 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.060
 to naples 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 the large urban and peripheral agglomeration and sanpaolo oddio here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.149
 instead the discourse is different is a discourse where the social comparison 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.650
 it gets harder more cruel 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.740
 reversing the famous title expression of one of the films 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440
 diving center 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.800
 to believe we could say that we are so close and so far away 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.240
 close to each other physically but in reality so far from a point of view 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.020
 of the marginalization that comes and that is created 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.070
 I then worked in the last period of the favelas 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 hey in the favelas and the speech of the belly of the city arrested by the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 suburbs in the belly of the city was particularly significant 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.129
 think of a citrus urban reaction 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.400
 that the Brazilian geographical and statistical institute 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:29.739
 the only one that 80% of the population today is organized compared to 25 30% d40 40 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.529
 Years ago 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.589
 the beans relax only 16,000 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:39.639
 of which about 4000 assam paolo 561 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.599
 orio of the rings 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.249
 but we are going to look at how these favelas are 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.599
 we realize that 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.819
 difficult to define what the favelas are from a building point of view 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.509
 they can be 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.620
 king of the agglomerations and constituted 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.110
 from mud dwellings in other cases from stilts in other cases via dwellings 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.589
 in masonry but very precarious very often raised nurallao 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.909
 we are faced as in the case of the famous other signa parma rio de 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.879
 janeiro famous because you visited since john 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.069
 paolo secondo we find ourselves in front of the oven and case cribs that yes 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.509
 they climb over one another and contain over 100,000 people 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.639
 also from an urbanistic point of view it is difficult to define why 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.340
 we find both the fari lassa 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.159
 next to the most privileged areas of the city I always refer to Rio 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.189
 alain delon nova giving central regions or we refer to large extensions 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.530
 marginality, however, always elegant 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.670
 .also symbol representing an economic connection means of 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.270
 domizzi disc to the pan of the sea that completely surrounds with only 200 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.950
 thousand inhabitants 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.630
 in the prestigious federal university of rio de janeiro but I gave immunity 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.190
 that connect electrical cables cell element fb see glue and this ed 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.180
 archiving the profound sense of alienation 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.140
 who suffers the inhabitant of the favela and who expresses himself as a point of hard 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.790
 turned against who and so close to him 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.659
 but actually so far away 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.669
 and therefore drug trafficking therefore drug therefore prostitution 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.340
 the vices of the city came about 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.670
 from the sea city of
