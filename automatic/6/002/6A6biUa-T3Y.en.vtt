00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:47.860 

so<00:00:38.680> slow<00:00:39.010> it<00:00:39.130> down<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.310> little<00:00:39.430> bit

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.120 

thumb<00:00:49.190> single<00:00:50.190> note

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.540 

single<00:00:55.130> note<00:00:55.450> which<00:00:56.450> is<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.660> D<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.550> I'm

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
single note which is a D and I'm

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.650 
single note which is a D and I'm
pinching<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.920> G<00:01:01.540> base<00:01:02.540> in<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.560> opening

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
pinching the G base in the opening

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:16.460 
pinching the G base in the opening
bringing<00:01:05.660> down<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.840> G<00:01:06.640> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.109 

so<00:01:17.470> once<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.740> get<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.610> can<00:01:18.820> also

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
so once you get that down you can also

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.460 
so once you get that down you can also
you<00:01:19.720> have<00:01:19.810> g7

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:36.760 

so<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> can

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.470 

so<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.010> hear<00:01:38.190> some<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> those<00:01:38.610> notes<00:01:38.880> just

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
so you can hear some of those notes just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.810 
so you can hear some of those notes just
these<00:01:39.840> justice<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.700> do

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
these justice not just a lot you can do

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:52.590 
these justice not just a lot you can do
just<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.120 

you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.780 

so<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:03.840> jumping<00:02:04.200> into<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> C<00:02:04.710> chord<00:02:04.950> you're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
so now jumping into the C chord you're

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
so now jumping into the C chord you're
doing<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> same<00:02:06.390> alternating<00:02:07.020> bass

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.990 

and<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.349> easier<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.890> might<00:02:23.190> instead

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and to make it easier you might instead

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.110 
and to make it easier you might instead
of<00:02:24.150> doing<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:25.519> c7<00:02:26.519> with<00:02:26.730> your<00:02:27.599> c-note<00:02:29.120> base

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
of doing this c7 with your c-note base

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.930 
of doing this c7 with your c-note base
that<00:02:30.870> strength<00:02:31.230> injured<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.370> might<00:02:32.580> bring<00:02:32.819> it

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that strength injured you might bring it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.640 
that strength injured you might bring it
up<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> genome<00:02:33.930> which<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.349> still<00:02:34.530> in

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
up here to the genome which is still in

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.570 
up here to the genome which is still in
the<00:02:34.769> C<00:02:35.129> chord<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.360> you're<00:02:36.569> using<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.019> whole

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
the C chord so you're using the whole

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.880 
the C chord so you're using the whole
this<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> haven't<00:02:39.150> any<00:02:39.360> problems<00:02:39.890> getting

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
this if you haven't any problems getting

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.979 
this if you haven't any problems getting
that<00:02:41.190> type<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.580> sound<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.810> you'd

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that type of a sound so you here you'd

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.680 
that type of a sound so you here you'd
be<00:02:43.110> doing<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.500> same<00:02:44.299> what<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.330> just<00:02:45.599> showed

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
be doing that same what I just showed

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.850 
be doing that same what I just showed
you<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> G<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:48.239> court<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.569> G<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.530> same

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you with the G the court of G the same

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.260 
you with the G the court of G the same
type<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.489> picking<00:02:50.849> pattern<00:02:51.299> you<00:02:51.480> could<00:02:51.599> do

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:09.320 

you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.559 

so<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.420> can<00:03:10.569> hear<00:03:10.720> that

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.020 

and<00:03:16.439> I'm<00:03:16.530> using<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.859> bottom<00:03:17.280> Gino<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> again

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
and I'm using that bottom Gino it again

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.759 
and I'm using that bottom Gino it again
you<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.420> throwing<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.930> there<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.739> know

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you know throwing it in there you know

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.289 
you know throwing it in there you know
you're<00:03:19.980> not<00:03:20.069> stuck<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.579> doing<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:20.999> way<00:03:21.030> I'm

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
you're not stuck to doing it the way I'm

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.309 
you're not stuck to doing it the way I'm
doing<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.719> you<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.019> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.310> hear<00:03:23.519> something

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
doing it you can if you hear something

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.440 
doing it you can if you hear something
and<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.439> decide<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:26.670> know<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.849> want<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.329> do

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
and you decide you know you want to do

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.479 
and you decide you know you want to do
that<00:03:27.659> as<00:03:28.079> some<00:03:28.319> other<00:03:28.560> type<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.769> variation<00:03:29.189> it

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
that as some other type of variation it

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.839 
that as some other type of variation it
be<00:03:29.670> fine<00:03:29.959> but<00:03:31.310> what<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.430> doing<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:33.000> I'm<00:03:34.849> my

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
be fine but what I'm doing is I'm my

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.349 
be fine but what I'm doing is I'm my
base<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.120> going<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:38.209> jumping<00:03:39.209> between

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
base is going like that jumping between

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:50.160 
base is going like that jumping between
the<00:03:39.599> sea<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.959> sea<00:03:40.170> note<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.769> going

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.760 

I'm<00:03:51.170> used<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.470> do<00:03:51.620> anything<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.530> it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
I'm used to do anything so and it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.110 
I'm used to do anything so and it
doesn't<00:03:55.100> take<00:03:55.130> too<00:03:55.340> long<00:03:55.490> get<00:03:55.700> used<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.970> doing

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
doesn't take too long get used to doing

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.600 
doesn't take too long get used to doing
it<00:03:56.300> anyways<00:03:58.030> something<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.150> be<00:03:59.240> that<00:03:59.420> in<00:04:00.290> the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
it anyways something to be that in the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.710 
it anyways something to be that in the
cc7<00:04:03.550> again<00:04:04.550> if<00:04:04.730> you're<00:04:04.880> having<00:04:05.030> problems<00:04:05.120> with

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
cc7 again if you're having problems with

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.230 
cc7 again if you're having problems with
it<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.680> fingering<00:04:07.250> or<00:04:07.490> just<00:04:07.790> if<00:04:08.000> you're

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
it the fingering or just if you're

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.820 
it the fingering or just if you're
trying<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.690> an<00:04:08.840> alternating<00:04:09.380> bass<00:04:09.560> will

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
trying to do an alternating bass will

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.540 
trying to do an alternating bass will
you<00:04:11.080> we're<00:04:12.080> jumping<00:04:12.620> between<00:04:12.800> those<00:04:13.250> two

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
you we're jumping between those two

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.520 
you we're jumping between those two
that's<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.150> little<00:04:14.270> bit<00:04:14.510> harder<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:15.200> can<00:04:15.350> just

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
that's a little bit harder you can just

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.930 
that's a little bit harder you can just
leave<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.860> on<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.100> gene<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.340> sounds<00:04:16.760> great

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
leave it on the gene that sounds great

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.990 
leave it on the gene that sounds great
just<00:04:17.000> by<00:04:17.420> going

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.659 

and<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.539> other<00:04:23.660> thing<00:04:23.720> too<00:04:24.080> before<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.669> I'm

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
and the other thing too before I I'm

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.589 
and the other thing too before I I'm
just<00:04:25.849> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.030> jump<00:04:26.120> ahead<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:27.830> whole

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
just going to jump ahead is this whole

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.930 
just going to jump ahead is this whole
structure<00:04:29.599> just<00:04:30.229> move<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:30.949> two<00:04:31.490> frets<00:04:31.729> and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
structure just move it up two frets and

now you do this little turnaround right
here<00:05:14.800> which<00:05:15.009> is<00:05:15.160> falling<00:05:15.940> chromatically<00:05:18.539> down

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
here which is falling chromatically down

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:28.020 
here which is falling chromatically down
the<00:05:23.009> d.d<00:05:24.009> strength<00:05:26.220> starting<00:05:27.220> with<00:05:27.340> a<00:05:27.400> each

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
the d.d strength starting with a each

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.029 
the d.d strength starting with a each
app<00:05:29.759> so<00:05:30.759> what<00:05:30.940> you're<00:05:31.030> also<00:05:31.210> doing<00:05:31.509> is<00:05:31.860> kind<00:05:32.860> of
