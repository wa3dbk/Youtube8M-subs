00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
so I'm very interested to see if we see

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.610 
so I'm very interested to see if we see
any<00:03:12.840> longer<00:03:13.590> life<00:03:14.280> out<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.730> these<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.780> we'll

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
any longer life out of these so we'll

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.680 
any longer life out of these so we'll
try<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.310> some<00:03:17.549> sample<00:03:18.140> video<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.229 
try and do some sample video and to
compare<00:03:22.110> am<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
compare am I think so right on the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.500 
compare am I think so right on the
charger<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:27.950> now<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.190> mention<00:03:29.549> some

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
charger like so now I will mention some

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.370 
charger like so now I will mention some
of<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.170> other<00:03:32.209> charters<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.570> find

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.590 

we're<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:38.130> spot<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.940> charge<00:03:39.239> two

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
we're going to have a spot to charge two

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.729 
we're going to have a spot to charge two
batteries<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.720> vivitar<00:03:42.720> rapid<00:03:43.470> travel

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
batteries and the vivitar rapid travel

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.330 
batteries and the vivitar rapid travel
charger<00:03:44.310> only<00:03:45.180> offers<00:03:46.340> one<00:03:47.340> charging<00:03:48.209> space

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
charger only offers one charging space

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.220 
charger only offers one charging space
so<00:03:50.340> that's<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.030> only<00:03:51.090> real<00:03:51.480> drawback<00:03:51.690> I've

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
so that's the only real drawback I've

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.330 
so that's the only real drawback I've
seen<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.739> far<00:03:53.570> here's<00:03:54.570> that

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.750 

this<00:03:58.030> feels<00:03:58.390> a<00:04:00.780> little<00:04:01.780> iffy<00:04:02.230> not<00:04:02.830> gonna<00:04:03.069> lie

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.699 

but<00:04:06.760> hopefully<00:04:07.150> I'll<00:04:07.209> be<00:04:07.300> all<00:04:07.569> right<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.620> if

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
but hopefully I'll be all right and if

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.309 
but hopefully I'll be all right and if
you<00:04:08.830> want<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.160> charge<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.940> car<00:04:10.319> you

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
you want to charge it in the car you

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.979 
you want to charge it in the car you
plug<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.709> in<00:04:11.830> right<00:04:11.860> here<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.870> that's

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
plug it in right here like so so that's

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.159 
plug it in right here like so so that's
basically<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:18.449> will<00:04:19.449> keep<00:04:19.630> messing<00:04:20.049> around

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
basically it will keep messing around

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.180 
basically it will keep messing around
with<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:22.169> let<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.350> know<00:04:23.470> how<00:04:23.650> things<00:04:23.860> go

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
with it and let you know how things go

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.920 
with it and let you know how things go
but<00:04:26.100> that's<00:04:27.100> basically<00:04:27.310> what<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:27.940> get<00:04:28.090> two

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
but that's basically what you get two

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.330 
but that's basically what you get two
