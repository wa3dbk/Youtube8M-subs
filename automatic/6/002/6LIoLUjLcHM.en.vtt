00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.260
 a few months ago, austria with the third generation rode it 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.600
 new a lexus gs in the region i was quite a bit of money about it 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.150
 is now in the netherlands and that is good news for an addition and 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.669
 the car 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.729
 with this luxury this ranking for the time being eighth last year were against 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.690
 but is competition and not just customers 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.760
 bmw 3 series is in my opinion the tastiest car in this segment 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.560
 yes get acquainted with the bmw m3 gt4 bbc 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310
 The reason is that it was for the first time in almost two decades 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.429
 and I may follow anyway see little news on anklets 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.469
 but he may be three times viewed young cats are put a point though 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.690
 was there for 150 hp r 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.690
 in the tent 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.260
 we have this morning to start and get the praise from the cupboard and be 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.340
 polished undergo lighting about it i study this car these beckers i 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.010
 I have never been so fond of lexus but they end March 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.300
 this is quite as signed as they could of course draw 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 he is busy in which the game rut pretty 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 20 hours before very successful is a lot less crowded than the exterior just one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480
 clear overview 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.970
 here and there some materials that could have been better in this class, we totally 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.590
 pictures really okay they performed funny gadget funny does not always mean 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 good 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 it was a big regulation of this climate control nades it's kind of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.009
 that's one thing you have dash offenders really nice to watch 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.210
 which made the show only ten years a plane temperature since that it 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 is not easy 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.290
 the claim of the navigation system with this the joystick mice join house chessman 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.870
 flowers 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.260
 first room just simple awkward you can it is very sensitive song 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.270
 but not in itself about the buttons henin screens really terrible 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 no man who set the farmers 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.080
 but the rest is real if you look around is this color scheme of it 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 to get the light that even comes back and the roof is incredibly spatial 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.780
 beautiful and luxurious beautiful lob 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.459
 yes those were beautiful interiors that they here so don't have to say if it's all free 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.150
 scanty I had that I would export that she kept awake with those lovely us 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.729
 materials themselves 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.329
 that is true seeing a prince first three was on the 5 series being the project 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.370
 it's the finish is good but it's not all that hot and nice 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 more about than as injections 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.799
 it's a bathroom 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.619
 for making glass plume 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.619
 manually also limits a little patient 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 and that can be your bw name or your escape this is just much more 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.169
 focused on driving and that's why the interior is all so clinically focused 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.369
 focuses on the driver 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.879
 if bw likes that 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.669
 he may not be your suitcase because of that was a mistake 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.129
 the dynamics has the name some members this is still the same room 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.879
 to drive he does not feel obese ahmadi needs a bit 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.579
 or 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.019
 steering is very fine bit vague the middle legs I have my reaction 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.969
 well and especially the balance in the total number beforehand it was a clichÃ© 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.969
 but it just still looks 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.849
 yes and that is a very different story in this lex because that is a very whole one 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.169
 comfortable for three reasons 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.299
 You also have b and w to know this in advance 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.029
 Of course those two weeks is the Danish made area 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.139
 this lexus is not near but still 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.679
 belong to those who certainly think so the traffic figures or overweight oil 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.409
 accenture 6 to avoid 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.549
 overall picture is just as good and responsible 6 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.429
 the comfortable 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.360
 this car could actually have defects 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.089
 with 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.089
 c class of mercedes for example 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.139
 99 grams 7 2 emissions I call a net that means that your car is incredibly 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.620
 had to meet 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.139
 then forget it but it saw the light 223 hp with your 20 percent 223 it is anyway 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.139
 fantastic 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.290
 the great thing is you have the hybrid powertrain directly below 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.410
 a lot of couple he picks up wonderfully fast, it really is a very nice one 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.740
 motor skills very fast intermediate sprints 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.740
 Toyota Hybrid the CVP as you 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.279
 I have been nagging about the CV often enough, and now it will not participate either 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.479
 in fact, this victory against because it has enough power, it is that much 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.840
 less to scream and yell and therefore 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.330
 is this a great solution for a CD? even more, I think it's the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 fifth win I have ever ridden eric bana fine live with 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.280
 9 Sep 2011 this vending machine simply has a blast in this division 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.669
 medical miss 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.479
 and our 7 hp 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.229
 also a car like this that is thick enough but to be economical in the 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.660
 eco pro mode 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.080
 you live an incredible life yourself if you give it a full blast, the matter will diverge somewhat 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.689
 know or from akon example where sport 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.339
 and then you notice these guys 70 km and if you sit better just go in speed 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.979
 with such an after he is always standard in the sign of fashion are that 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.409
 starting this year in the eyes of meals in defends no pure filip 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.059
 and boats have indicated click up 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:38.059
 to get a little speed 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.160
 Japanese investors probably hoped that this would forget the back seat 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.949
 but unfortunately they are not forgotten at the last minute 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.009
 this is really for this class 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.429
 he is also useful, she says, the previous first belief right away but yes 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.759
 for the first also nothing this car is less space behind the bmw 3 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.039
 series and that is always a party behind there are striking both could leg 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.059
 diego simeone has us in those little smart things what more than 4 yes 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.019
 but still if you belgrade anp the local hero and you especially that 3 series 

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:14.119
 but for real 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:18.209
 the comfortable trip collided this is really a test package to follow but stronger 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:20.509
 I still a few times again a little entry it feels good close is a 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.879
 class higher between this dynamic balance is simply more beautiful 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.199
 as a total package it feels 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.689
 if one step higher I say that finds or basis if it is true what is much more expensive 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.569
 what strikes me in this 48th most luxurious version with three sentences 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:35.039
 if we don't 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.240
 44 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.230
 he has expected a lot of half eye next to the always no 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.660
 the lexus
