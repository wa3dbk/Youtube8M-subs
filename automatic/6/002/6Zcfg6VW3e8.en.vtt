all<00:00:01.439> right<00:00:01.680> welcome<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.280> biology<00:00:03.120> mini

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
all right welcome to a biology mini

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.880 
all right welcome to a biology mini
lesson<00:00:03.750> today<00:00:04.080> we'll<00:00:04.230> be<00:00:04.319> looking<00:00:04.470> at<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
lesson today we'll be looking at the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
lesson today we'll be looking at the
iodine<00:00:05.640> test<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.240> starch<00:00:06.830> so<00:00:07.830> iodine<00:00:08.870> as

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
iodine test for starch so iodine as

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.209 
iodine test for starch so iodine as
we've<00:00:10.080> used<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.410> class<00:00:10.590> before<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:11.099> an

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we've used in class before as an

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.350 
we've used in class before as an
indicator<00:00:11.870> and<00:00:12.870> iodine<00:00:13.519> when<00:00:14.519> mixed<00:00:15.299> with

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
indicator and iodine when mixed with

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.050 
indicator and iodine when mixed with
starch<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:16.199> indicate<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.310> presence<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
starch can indicate the presence of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.410 
starch can indicate the presence of
starch<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.289> iodine<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> test<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.460> starch

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.099 

if<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:26.019> think<00:00:26.260> back<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.410> starch<00:00:26.800> starch<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:28.689> a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
if you think back to starch starch is a

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.630 
if you think back to starch starch is a
carbohydrate<00:00:30.240> found<00:00:31.240> mainly<00:00:31.900> in<00:00:32.550> plant<00:00:33.550> cells

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
carbohydrate found mainly in plant cells

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.460 
carbohydrate found mainly in plant cells
there's<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.790> stored<00:00:37.239> form<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.600> glucose<00:00:38.079> so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
there's a stored form of glucose so

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.990 
there's a stored form of glucose so
glucose<00:00:38.860> has<00:00:38.980> chained<00:00:39.280> up<00:00:39.460> into<00:00:39.670> these<00:00:39.790> long

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
glucose has chained up into these long

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.630 
glucose has chained up into these long
starch<00:00:40.329> molecules<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:42.220> plants<00:00:42.489> store

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
starch molecules and the plants store

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.490 
starch molecules and the plants store
them<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.030> then<00:00:43.330> you<00:00:43.540> eat<00:00:43.750> them<00:00:43.960> when<00:00:44.320> you<00:00:44.410> buy

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
them and then you eat them when you buy

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.009 
them and then you eat them when you buy
vegetables<00:00:44.710> from<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.160> grocery<00:00:45.400> like

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
vegetables from the grocery like

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.799 
vegetables from the grocery like
potatoes<00:00:47.019> so<00:00:47.829> iodine<00:00:48.400> which<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.210> amber

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
potatoes so iodine which is a amber

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.850 
potatoes so iodine which is a amber
color<00:00:50.050> liquid<00:00:50.260> I'll<00:00:50.500> pull<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.680> up<00:00:50.829> right<00:00:51.010> here

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
color liquid I'll pull it up right here

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.350 
color liquid I'll pull it up right here
right<00:00:53.860> here<00:00:54.040> on<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.190> right<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.879> amber<00:00:55.180> color

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
right here on the right the amber color

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.660 
right here on the right the amber color
liquid<00:00:55.600> here<00:00:56.019> is<00:00:56.140> iodine<00:00:56.769> when<00:00:57.399> it's<00:00:57.550> a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
liquid here is iodine when it's a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.180 
liquid here is iodine when it's a
negative<00:00:58.149> test<00:00:58.329> for<00:00:58.510> starch<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:59.140> retains<00:00:59.469> its

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
negative test for starch it retains its

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.220 
negative test for starch it retains its
a<00:01:00.399> amber<00:01:00.850> color<00:01:01.059> so<00:01:01.390> there's<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.719> gold<00:01:01.930> iron

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
a amber color so there's the gold iron

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.680 
a amber color so there's the gold iron
right<00:01:02.680> here<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.820> iodine<00:01:04.059> is<00:01:04.269> mixed<00:01:04.600> with

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
right here when iodine is mixed with

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.719 
right here when iodine is mixed with
starch<00:01:05.050> or<00:01:05.320> starch<00:01:05.560> solution<00:01:05.740> or<00:01:06.340> drop<00:01:06.550> that<00:01:06.700> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
starch or starch solution or drop that a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.850 
starch or starch solution or drop that a
potato<00:01:07.090> or<00:01:07.420> maybe<00:01:07.600> some<00:01:08.170> some<00:01:08.560> corn<00:01:08.800> chips

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
potato or maybe some some corn chips

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.040 
potato or maybe some some corn chips
with<00:01:09.250> corn<00:01:09.460> starch<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.390> turns<00:01:10.690> black

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
with corn starch in it it turns black

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.800 
with corn starch in it it turns black
this<00:01:11.350> purple<00:01:11.590> black<00:01:11.979> color<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.210> positive

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
this purple black color so a positive

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
this purple black color so a positive
test<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.259> purple<00:01:14.649> black<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.780> positive<00:01:17.229> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
test is purple black so positive is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.230 
test is purple black so positive is
purple<00:01:19.210> black<00:01:19.960> color<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.369> negative<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
purple black color and a negative is the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.710 
purple black color and a negative is the
amber<00:01:22.720> color<00:01:23.020> stays<00:01:23.649> amber<00:01:24.130> now<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:25.600> is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
amber color stays amber now this is

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.880 
amber color stays amber now this is
important<00:01:26.140> for<00:01:26.229> us<00:01:26.350> we<00:01:26.500> use<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.740> in<00:01:26.830> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
important for us we use it in the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.940 
important for us we use it in the
osmosis<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.520> fusion<00:01:27.850> lab<00:01:27.940> but<00:01:28.630> also<00:01:29.020> it's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
osmosis in the fusion lab but also it's

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.510 
osmosis in the fusion lab but also it's
important<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:31.860> bring<00:01:32.860> this<00:01:32.979> up<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.460> I

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
important in bring this up here and I

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.850 
important in bring this up here and I
guess<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.729> have<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.939> erase<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.450> get<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.750> up

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.910 

this<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.820> picture<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.480> person's<00:01:40.810> arm<00:01:40.990> so

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
this is a picture of a person's arm so

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.410 
this is a picture of a person's arm so
what's<00:01:42.100> been<00:01:42.220> done<00:01:42.370> here<00:01:42.400> is<00:01:42.910> this<00:01:43.210> person

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
what's been done here is this person

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.420 
what's been done here is this person
suffers<00:01:43.870> from<00:01:43.960> hyper<00:01:44.380> hydrosis<00:01:44.800> which<00:01:45.280> is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
suffers from hyper hydrosis which is

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.150 
suffers from hyper hydrosis which is
excessive<00:01:46.240> sweating<00:01:46.480> so<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.500> person<00:01:47.680> in

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
excessive sweating so this person in

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.130 
excessive sweating so this person in
this<00:01:48.370> area<00:01:48.760> can't<00:01:49.060> tell<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.510> their<00:01:49.660> armpits

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
this area can't tell if is their armpits

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.500 
this area can't tell if is their armpits
maybe<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.740> armpit<00:01:51.010> or<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.220> name<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.240> I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
maybe the armpit or the name of the I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.540 
maybe the armpit or the name of the I
can't<00:01:53.260> tell<00:01:53.440> anyway<00:01:53.680> but<00:01:53.830> anyway<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.220> person

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
can't tell anyway but anyway this person

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.910 
can't tell anyway but anyway this person
suffers<00:01:54.820> from<00:01:54.940> excess<00:01:55.810> sweating<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.320> what

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
suffers from excess sweating and what

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.290 
suffers from excess sweating and what
they've<00:01:57.040> done<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.280> they<00:01:57.370> treat<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.610> with<00:01:57.790> Botox

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
they've done is they treat it with Botox

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.990 
they've done is they treat it with Botox
and<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.870> remember<00:01:59.350> Botox<00:02:00.220> from<00:02:00.490> popular

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
and if you remember Botox from popular

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.840 
and if you remember Botox from popular
media<00:02:01.300> it's<00:02:01.479> what<00:02:01.600> they<00:02:01.690> used<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.850> tighten

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
media it's what they used to to tighten

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.920 
media it's what they used to to tighten
up<00:02:03.910> people's<00:02:04.240> faces

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
up people's faces

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.290 
up people's faces
so<00:02:05.020> basically<00:02:05.320> Botox<00:02:05.830> is<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.979> poison<00:02:06.490> made<00:02:07.120> by<00:02:07.270> a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
so basically Botox is a poison made by a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.590 
so basically Botox is a poison made by a
bacteria<00:02:07.900> it's<00:02:08.050> botulism<00:02:08.590> toxin<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.940> it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
bacteria it's botulism toxin and it it

need that water to help that that
positive<00:02:54.580> starts<00:02:55.120> just<00:02:55.299> come<00:02:55.480> out<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.470> a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
positive starts just come out so just a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.560 
positive starts just come out so just a
little<00:02:56.620> aside<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.760> remember<00:02:58.150> positive

little aside and just remember positive

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.050 
little aside and just remember positive
iodine<00:02:59.140> test<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.590> black<00:02:59.860> negative<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
iodine test is black negative is the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.049
