ingredients but I guess it's supposed to
be<00:01:03.510> good<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.110> eyes<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:05.549> big<00:01:05.970> claims<00:01:06.299> on

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I don't know if that's intentional or

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
things I like about this mascara I think

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.770 
things I like about this mascara I think
that<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> packaging<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.150> really<00:02:26.330> cute

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that the packaging is really cute

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.870 
that the packaging is really cute
I<00:02:26.930> love<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.770> silver<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> green<00:02:28.850> on

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.780 
it
I<00:02:30.020> think<00:02:30.440> Physicians<00:02:30.830> Formula<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.340> general<00:02:31.670> is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
I think Physicians Formula in general is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.940 
I think Physicians Formula in general is
a<00:02:31.820> brand<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.270> always<00:02:32.600> puts<00:02:33.350> their<00:02:33.710> money

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
a brand that always puts their money

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
a brand that always puts their money
into<00:02:34.220> packaging<00:02:34.940> which<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.210> probably<00:02:35.510> why

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
into packaging which is probably why

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.240 
into packaging which is probably why
some<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:36.080> their<00:02:36.170> products<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.890> expensive

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
some of their products are so expensive

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.150 
some of their products are so expensive
but<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.270> nice<00:02:38.510> packaging<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.500> regards<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
but it is nice packaging in regards to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040 
but it is nice packaging in regards to
the<00:02:40.280> actual<00:02:40.670> formula<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.360> mascara<00:02:41.720> I

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the actual formula of the mascara I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.810 
the actual formula of the mascara I
think<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:42.950> does<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> good<00:02:43.520> job<00:02:43.580> in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
think that this does a good job in

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.360 
think that this does a good job in
adding<00:02:44.420> some<00:02:44.720> volume<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.380> your<00:02:45.470> eyelashes<00:02:46.190> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
adding some volume to your eyelashes and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.630 
adding some volume to your eyelashes and
even<00:02:47.240> some<00:02:47.450> length<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.740> color<00:02:49.070> ultra

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
even some length and the color ultra

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.970 
even some length and the color ultra
black<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.180> think<00:02:50.450> does<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> great<00:02:51.110> job<00:02:51.170> at<00:02:51.680> really

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
black I think does a great job at really

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.150 
black I think does a great job at really
defining<00:02:52.490> your<00:02:53.030> lashes<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:54.500> regards<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
defining your lashes in regards to the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.950 
defining your lashes in regards to the
actual<00:02:55.460> formula<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.120> mascara<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.720> think

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
actual formula of this mascara I think

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.330 
actual formula of this mascara I think
that<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.320> does<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.620> pretty<00:02:57.890> good<00:02:57.980> job<00:02:58.130> in

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that this does a pretty good job in

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
that this does a pretty good job in
adding<00:02:58.730> some<00:02:58.970> volume<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.570> your<00:02:59.690> eyelashes<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
adding some volume to your eyelashes and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.830 
adding some volume to your eyelashes and
even<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.740> little<00:03:00.860> bit<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.160> length<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
even a little bit of length and the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.840 
even a little bit of length and the
color<00:03:03.200> ultra<00:03:03.709> black<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.250> definitely<00:03:04.820> a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
color ultra black is definitely a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.970 
color ultra black is definitely a
pigmented<00:03:05.510> black<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.170> feel<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> makes<00:03:06.830> my

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
pigmented black I feel like it makes my

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
pigmented black I feel like it makes my
eyelashes<00:03:07.610> very<00:03:07.820> visible<00:03:08.390> with<00:03:08.900> two<00:03:09.230> coats

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
eyelashes very visible with two coats

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.080 
eyelashes very visible with two coats

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
like they do have volume and they look a

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.820 
like they do have volume and they look a
lot<00:03:14.150> better<00:03:14.330> than<00:03:14.600> they<00:03:14.720> did<00:03:14.870> without<00:03:15.050> mascara

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
lot better than they did without mascara

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
and I do have straight eyelashes so

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.080 
and I do have straight eyelashes so
those<00:03:37.100> are<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.459> things<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:37.880> like

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
those are all the things that I like

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.449 
those are all the things that I like
about<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.510> mascara<00:03:39.050> now<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:39.920> terms<00:03:40.190> of

about this mascara now in terms of
things<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.820> found<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.209> didn't<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.600> about

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
things I found that I didn't like about

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.680 
things I found that I didn't like about
this<00:03:41.989> mascara<00:03:42.530> for<00:03:43.250> one<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.700> stays<00:03:44.000> sort<00:03:44.570> of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
this mascara for one it stays sort of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.470 
this mascara for one it stays sort of
tacky<00:03:44.989> on<00:03:45.230> your<00:03:45.470> eyelashes<00:03:46.130> all<00:03:46.370> day<00:03:46.610> long<00:03:46.820> so

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
tacky on your eyelashes all day long so

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.070 
tacky on your eyelashes all day long so
it<00:03:47.510> never<00:03:47.930> dries<00:03:48.650> completely<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:50.060> feels<00:03:50.360> like

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
it never dries completely it feels like

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960 
it never dries completely it feels like
if<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.470> touch<00:03:51.709> your<00:03:51.739> eyelashes<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.550> can<00:03:52.700> kind

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
if you touch your eyelashes you can kind

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.050 
if you touch your eyelashes you can kind
of<00:03:53.120> feel<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> little<00:03:54.019> bit<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.200> tackiness<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.220> I

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
of feel a little bit of tackiness and I

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.490 
of feel a little bit of tackiness and I
definitely<00:03:56.480> wouldn't<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.870> able<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.170> take<00:03:57.380> an

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
definitely wouldn't be able to take an

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.430 
definitely wouldn't be able to take an
eyelash<00:03:57.860> curler<00:03:57.920> over<00:03:58.880> my<00:03:59.030> mascara<00:03:59.600> to<00:04:00.170> try<00:04:00.380> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
eyelash curler over my mascara to try to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.020 
eyelash curler over my mascara to try to
add<00:04:00.650> any<00:04:00.890> more<00:04:00.980> curl<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.670> them

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
add any more curl to them

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.580 
add any more curl to them
another<00:04:02.390> reason<00:04:02.600> that's<00:04:02.840> not<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.110> good<00:04:03.380> thing

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
another reason that's not a good thing

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.560 
another reason that's not a good thing
is<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:04.010> found<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.700> throughout<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.360> day

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
is that I found that throughout the day

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.320 
is that I found that throughout the day
if<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.800> really<00:04:07.130> windy<00:04:07.400> or<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.120> just

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
if it was really windy or if I just

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.690 
if it was really windy or if I just
happen<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.600> rub<00:04:08.840> my<00:04:08.989> eyes<00:04:09.200> my<00:04:09.920> eyelashes<00:04:10.550> would

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
happen to rub my eyes my eyelashes would

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.340 
happen to rub my eyes my eyelashes would
clump<00:04:11.030> together<00:04:11.209> because<00:04:11.810> they<00:04:11.930> were<00:04:11.989> still

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
clump together because they were still

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.770 
clump together because they were still
tacky<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:13.040> I'd<00:04:13.489> have<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.700> separate<00:04:14.330> them<00:04:14.540> with

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
tacky and I'd have to separate them with

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.849 
tacky and I'd have to separate them with
like<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.019> spoolie<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.650> just<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.190> them<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.370> low

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
like a spoolie to just get them to low

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.670 
like a spoolie to just get them to low
fanned<00:04:17.819> out<00:04:18.000> again<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.629> in<00:04:18.989> fact<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.410> couple<00:04:19.530> of

fanned out again and in fact a couple of

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.009 
fanned out again and in fact a couple of
my<00:04:19.829> wife<00:04:20.009> eyelashes<00:04:20.699> here<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.690> stuck

my wife eyelashes here have stuck

my wife eyelashes here have stuck
together<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.620> can't<00:04:23.129> get<00:04:23.310> them<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.520> feed

like about this mascara and I don't know

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.050 
like about this mascara and I don't know
if<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.229> sensitivity<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.099> me<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:30.030> I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
if it's just the sensitivity to me but I

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.809 
if it's just the sensitivity to me but I
found<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.840> at<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.110> base<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:31.830> eyelashes

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
found that at the base of my eyelashes

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.390 
found that at the base of my eyelashes
they<00:04:33.389> felt<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.840> little<00:04:33.960> bit<00:04:34.199> itchy<00:04:34.379> by<00:04:34.800> mid<00:04:35.159> to

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
they felt a little bit itchy by mid to

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.589 
they felt a little bit itchy by mid to
end<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.819> day<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:37.349> don't<00:04:37.470> normally<00:04:37.860> have

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
end of day and I don't normally have

end of day and I don't normally have
sensitivities<00:04:39.599> or<00:04:39.629> allergies<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.710> makeup<00:04:41.129> or

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
sensitivities or allergies to makeup or

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.189 
sensitivities or allergies to makeup or
pretty<00:04:42.030> much<00:04:42.180> anything<00:04:42.449> I<00:04:42.659> don't<00:04:42.840> tend<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.110> be

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
pretty much anything I don't tend to be

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.159 
pretty much anything I don't tend to be
a<00:04:43.229> very<00:04:43.440> sensitive<00:04:43.680> person<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:46.020> one

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
a very sensitive person so this is one

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.529 
a very sensitive person so this is one
of<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.379> first<00:04:46.620> mascaras<00:04:47.430> I've<00:04:47.699> noticed<00:04:48.240> that

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
of the first mascaras I've noticed that

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.260 
of the first mascaras I've noticed that
has<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.050> caused<00:04:49.860> any<00:04:50.159> sort<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.520> irritation

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
has really caused any sort of irritation

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.390 
has really caused any sort of irritation
or<00:04:51.360> itchiness<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.080> my<00:04:52.229> eyes<00:04:52.409> so<00:04:53.009> those<00:04:53.159> two

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
or itchiness to my eyes so those two

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.760 
or itchiness to my eyes so those two
reasons<00:04:53.610> alone<00:04:54.030> would<00:04:54.240> be<00:04:54.270> enough<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:55.530> me<00:04:55.740> not

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
reasons alone would be enough for me not

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.159 
reasons alone would be enough for me not
to<00:04:56.039> repurchase<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:56.880> mascara<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.690> definitely

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
to repurchase this mascara I definitely

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.270 
to repurchase this mascara I definitely
don't<00:04:58.289> want<00:04:58.560> anything<00:04:58.800> that's<00:04:58.949> gonna<00:04:59.190> cause

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
don't want anything that's gonna cause

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.089 
don't want anything that's gonna cause
any<00:04:59.520> sort<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.080> itchiness<00:05:01.080> or<00:05:01.349> irritation<00:05:01.979> in

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
any sort of itchiness or irritation in

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.950 
any sort of itchiness or irritation in
my<00:05:02.190> eyes<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.300> fact<00:05:03.509> that<00:05:03.569> it<00:05:03.720> stays<00:05:03.930> a

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
my eyes and the fact that it stays a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.659 
my eyes and the fact that it stays a
little<00:05:04.139> bit<00:05:04.380> tacky<00:05:04.590> even<00:05:05.039> though<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.250> adds<00:05:05.460> a

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
little bit tacky even though it adds a

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.450 
little bit tacky even though it adds a
volume<00:05:05.819> and<00:05:06.180> definition<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:07.139> holds<00:05:08.009> my<00:05:08.130> curl

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
volume and definition and holds my curl

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.610 
volume and definition and holds my curl
is<00:05:09.180> another<00:05:09.630> reason<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.080> wouldn't<00:05:10.349> want<00:05:10.560> to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
is another reason I wouldn't want to

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.110 
is another reason I wouldn't want to
reuse<00:05:11.009> it<00:05:11.039> because<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.669> feel<00:05:11.849> like<00:05:11.940> there's

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
reuse it because I feel like there's

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.670
