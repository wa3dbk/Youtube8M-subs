00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there's your outlet then on the outlet

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.680 
there's your outlet then on the outlet

sits<00:03:49.370> snugly<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:52.990> like<00:03:53.990> that<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:56.240> little

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
sits snugly in like that the little

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.520 
sits snugly in like that the little
filter<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.020> there<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.380> we<00:03:57.590> look<00:03:57.800> in<00:03:59.530> look

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
filter is in there and we look in look

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.040 
filter is in there and we look in look
out<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.830> that<00:04:01.330> if<00:04:02.330> you're<00:04:02.480> looking<00:04:02.750> from<00:04:02.930> this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
out of that if you're looking from this

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.580 
out of that if you're looking from this
side<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:04.570> can<00:04:05.570> see<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.100> end<00:04:07.250> they're

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
side you can see it in the end they're

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.610 
side you can see it in the end they're
not<00:04:09.590> looking<00:04:10.750> all<00:04:11.750> right<00:04:12.050> you<00:04:12.230> know<00:04:12.350> hips

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
not looking all right you know hips

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.650 
not looking all right you know hips
because<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:13.700> only<00:04:13.820> ones<00:04:14.060> we<00:04:14.210> could<00:04:14.300> get<00:04:14.480> with

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
because the only ones we could get with

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.690 
because the only ones we could get with
one<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.110> bendy<00:04:15.500> make<00:04:15.950> sure<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.310> bendy

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
one with the bendy make sure the bendy

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.470 
one with the bendy make sure the bendy
bit<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:17.140> face<00:04:18.140> is<00:04:18.410> where<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.670> water<00:04:19.880> goes<00:04:20.180> in

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
bit is face is where the water goes in

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.810 
bit is face is where the water goes in
where<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.960> water<00:04:21.110> goes<00:04:21.320> out<00:04:21.530> I'm<00:04:22.520> going<00:04:22.760> to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
where the water goes out I'm going to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.310 
where the water goes out I'm going to
put<00:04:23.000> these<00:04:23.180> in<00:04:23.300> try<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.630> get<00:04:23.750> these<00:04:23.870> in<00:04:24.080> all

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
put these in try and get these in all

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.080 
put these in try and get these in all
together<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.930> push<00:04:27.260> those<00:04:27.470> down

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
together so push those down

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.120 
together so push those down
tap<00:04:29.090> tap<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.750> download<00:04:30.110> app<00:04:30.770> tech<00:04:30.980> keep

tap tap it download app tech keep

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.800 
tap tap it download app tech keep
tapping<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.430> down<00:04:31.610> until<00:04:32.360> they're<00:04:32.570> nice<00:04:32.780> and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
tapping it down until they're nice and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.410 
tapping it down until they're nice and
firm<00:04:33.170> in<00:04:33.380> there<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> inside<00:04:34.910> will<00:04:35.180> look<00:04:35.330> a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
firm in there so the inside will look a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.360 
firm in there so the inside will look a
bit<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.170> if<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.830> cannot<00:04:36.980> if<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.250> can

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
bit like that if you cannot if you can

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.120 
bit like that if you cannot if you can
see<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.640> or<00:04:37.760> not

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
see it or not

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.710 
see it or not
then<00:04:40.130> we're<00:04:40.430> going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.610> put<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.420> end<00:04:41.510> on

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
will go in the end push in flat like

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.230 
will go in the end push in flat like
that<00:04:59.770> do<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.920> other<00:05:01.040> earth<00:05:01.400> do<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.820> same<00:05:02.030> with
