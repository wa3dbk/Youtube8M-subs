a<00:01:29.070> PC<00:01:29.520> version<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> both<00:01:30.150> those<00:01:30.390> games<00:01:30.950> weird

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a PC version of both those games weird

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730 
a PC version of both those games weird
look<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.750> I've<00:01:33.900> talked<00:01:34.229> about<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
look I get it and I've talked about it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340 
look I get it and I've talked about it
before<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> realize<00:01:35.759> due<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> rising<00:01:37.049> cost

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
before I realize due to the rising cost

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.340 
before I realize due to the rising cost
of<00:01:37.619> developing<00:01:38.189> triple-a<00:01:38.759> games<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.960> game

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
of developing triple-a games that game

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859 
of developing triple-a games that game
staying<00:01:40.799> exclusive<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> certain<00:01:42.299> platform

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
staying exclusive to a certain platform

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.859 
staying exclusive to a certain platform
is<00:01:43.130> becoming<00:01:44.130> less<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.640> less<00:01:44.909> relevant<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
is becoming less and less relevant and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
is becoming less and less relevant and
less<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> less<00:01:46.439> realistic<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.659> same

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
less and less realistic but at the same

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.980 
less and less realistic but at the same
time<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.710> reason<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.549> people<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.540> inclined

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
time the reason that people are inclined

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
time the reason that people are inclined
