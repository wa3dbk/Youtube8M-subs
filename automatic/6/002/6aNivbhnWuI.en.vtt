00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.990
 I do not know why 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 hello everyone here I bring you a new 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.119
 gameplay of black ops 2 good is the one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.369
 I promised you where I was going to show 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.050
 two higher gusts of the game what 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.539
 are the dogs called unit 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.550
 canine 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.949
 the swarm that are a few aircraft landmarks 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.890
 little ones that shoot towards 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.579
 the enemies 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.620
 first is to say that the game is 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.590
 cut or cut enough chubs 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.329
 because I preferred to go more better 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.520
 directly to what's important if I do not know 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.079
 the video was very long and the second one said 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.570
 that is not an online game but it is 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.570
 a game playing against bots ie 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.540
 against against players and controlled 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.280
 by the machine and they are low level they are 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.659
 low level because I wanted to make sure 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.489
 to get me these streaks to be able to 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.930
 show us the and the truth is that not yet 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.030
 I see myself trained to get these out 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.740
 high gusts in normal online games 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.960
 why 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 I do not have yet I do not know the controls 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.740
 well from playstation3 I get confused a lot 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 with the buttons and I lack a lot of fluency 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
 it lacks a lot of practice so good 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 played against you to get these out 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 gusts on this map called express 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.010
 and it is a very original station 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.290
 train is a very long map that site 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.810
 an area out there in the background now where 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.720
 I'm right now and in the background 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.500
 quite a map yet but it's pretty 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.050
 elongated is also a 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920
 a station in which trains pass 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.180
 really 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.300
 apart from this that is parked by the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.390
 the trains pass by and you go to see 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.640
 that when your first streak 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.070
 It gives me a pretty nasty surprise 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 because I did not know it was not the first 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
 time I play on this map 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.150
 and the truth is that it is quite comical not 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.420
 I know if it is now I do not remember it well 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.700
 there is point 30 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.060
 putting me the streak I should have 10 or 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.560
 approximately they already had views to the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 dogs 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.670
 and suddenly he happens surprising me 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.200
 totally because I did not expect for 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.349
 nothing that came around 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.940
 and good so remember with the future 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.769
 this game the first few times until 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.830
 that got used to it I made a weird noise 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.150
 it's the train that comes 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.550
 and try to remove them from the track zone 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.930
 I set to get a little faster to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.560
 winged wings locating the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.410
 to the bots 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.970
 and good 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.170
 what he said about the map 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.490
 from what I saw so far I think he 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.100
 more original I thought 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.420
 and one of the most handsome so 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.790
 less aesthetically when playing 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.840
 online games I have not tried yet 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.520
 but but it looks good the other 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.350
 I like it a lot, it 's where I uploaded the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.940
 last game to search and destroy 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.590
 the overflow that I do think they are 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.460
 the two maps so this moment more 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.130
 they have convinced me 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.870
 and well, since I have the 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.640
 dogs are going to see how good they are not going to 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.820
 To make many casualties I do not take out 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.820
 here 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.860
 and well they are similar to those of 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.960
 blank white one 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.490
 look at you there comes one a puppy of these 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.490
 to load this one 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.830
 now I take out the swarm youtube was 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.950
 jump to the dogs but there is no one 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.710
 new is the swarm that is pretty is 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.350
 quite handsome 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.010
 the last drop is with the swarm by 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.129
 you can both see the death chambers 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.680
 which is where it best looks like as 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.220
 attack those of the swarm to fix 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.220
 to do now 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.790
 and this is like a tiny little plane 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.080
 of the size smaller than a person and 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.080
 that attacks directly to the body 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.459
 and good nothing, that's all I hope 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.530
 you liked the video the x favorites 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.280
 if you liked it and until next time 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280
 chao video
