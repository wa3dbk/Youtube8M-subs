00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.910
 Good folks in this video, we're going 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 remember how to reset the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.490
 epson cx5000 600 printer has people 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.469
 is talking specifically about this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 model with which the reset process of this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.369
 printer is a bit different then 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.949
 it does not go by the same standard that is the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 option that asks for caution that is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 used in the adjustment program then 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.769
 start downloading the program 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 setting of this printer 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.840
 So, if your site is 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.730
 looking for one by one some 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 information about a printer 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 I always try to enter the option is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.200
 search the site first you do the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 goal 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 on the website, and then you're on the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.620
 searching you will put a word 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 key 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 according to their research that in the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 Our case is 5600 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 when I do this and click the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.590
 look will go back on the screen for you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.239
 all searches related to 5,600 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.340
 so there appeared to be problems here 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.730
 reset because within this text 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.049
 you probably have the word 5 600 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 Compatibility of epson heads is very 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 cool after you give it a read by 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 that you will learn that many heads 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.010
 can be used in other models 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.650
 for example at 5,600 rpm to 25æm 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 example but what matters to us is this 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.759
 here is a 5,600 adjustment program that is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 in the downloads section 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.689
 so I'll download the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.340
 program then when clicking on it will 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.060
 be redirected to another 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.689
 download 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.689
 so come on 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:39.679
 and here down I have the link to the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.679
 download 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.510
 the file will download now do not delay 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 a lot and it's not very big and we're going 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.020
 begin the process of resetting it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.450
 ready the file downloaded 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.130
 I'll ask here from the side to show the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.100
 it in the folder that usually will stay 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.220
 in the downloads folder or click the button 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.750
 right on top of the compressed file and 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.010
 I'll put the extract to pass 5,600 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 this option appears to me because I 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.410
 I have installed the problem in rare 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.250
 that does the compaction and here I have 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.230
 the installation files have a manual 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.690
 reset here also later if you 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.020
 I want to take a look and I'll apply 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.360
 in the folder where the files are only one 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.940
 tip is always important you look for 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.130
 pay attention in the folder of 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.010
 settings file 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.310
 if you do not have any files with the name 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.750
 read me point 3 t or e jimmy that are 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.549
 files that usually give you 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 some conditions 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.110
 programs of the type is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.180
 there are some problems that only run 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.440
 on a certain date then you have to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.420
 change the date of the computer so that 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.440
 to run in this case has no 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.459
 restriction 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.810
 just click the program and service ft 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.810
 an adjustment problem will appear 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.770
 here the adjustment program and the option 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.260
 normally used is the option as soon as 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.480
 Calm down to reset the season 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.220
 only in this printer the agent does not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.630
 use this option because it will 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.820
 result in a first moment but later 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.940
 She's going to start giving trouble, she's going to 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.880
 again return to reset status 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.100
 So what are we going to do in this one? 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.740
 model specifically in this model 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.750
 we use the option and ready to kopp 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.620
 restore the factory default settings. 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.780
 printer 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.640
 only when I restore the default 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.580
 factory settings that have been 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.190
 made in the printer they will go back to 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.850
 the initial condition and especially 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.190
 speaking the radin cut option that configures 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.560
 the print head in relation to the plate 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.630
 logic this option will also generate 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.270
 then you need to make a copy of the rad 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.610
 first before resetting the 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.670
 by the test of the cup 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.430
 So how do I do this fred I'm going to give 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.350
 a ride and it will carry the value 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.959
 configured on this printer is the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.060
 Her remedy for those who do not remember network is 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.460
 that information you have on the 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.110
 print head that has to have 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.910
 be configured on the head plate 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.680
 to function properly every time I 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.990
 change the plate or change the head has 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.990
 to redo this setting 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.100
 well I gave the ride option 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.660
 then she showed me that it's any radio 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.940
 I'm going to click the button 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.620
 right click and corrupt it here 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.450
 to the beach transfer area of ​​the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310
 windows for later I can restore 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.870
 I do this so I do not have to take it off 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.300
 the head take the cartridge to make it 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.520
 do the reading on the left, so I 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.740
 already put here already I got everything right 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.040
 copied into the clipboard of the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.470
 windows and I'll go back to the option and you're done 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.880
 until the cup 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.130
 now i will restore the factory default 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.530
 then the option is to restore a message 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.840
 talking about the risks of doing it and then I 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.100
 I will select the image of hiprom either
