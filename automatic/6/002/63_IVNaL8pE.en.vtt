00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
after I'm just coasting below 40 and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.140 
after I'm just coasting below 40 and
starts<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.080> auto<00:03:51.260> really<00:03:51.650> rough<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.819> we'll<00:03:53.000> get

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
starts to auto really rough so we'll get

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.710 
starts to auto really rough so we'll get
speed<00:03:53.540> here
