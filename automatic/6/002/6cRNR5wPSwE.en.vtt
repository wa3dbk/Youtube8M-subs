probably more surface for mature

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.750 
probably more surface for mature

to do it critical analytical analytical
thinking<00:03:47.599> wasn't<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.290> much<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.590> problem

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
thinking wasn't so much a problem

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.830 
thinking wasn't so much a problem
because<00:03:49.189> from<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.939> background<00:03:50.090> add<00:03:50.420> come<00:03:50.659> up

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
