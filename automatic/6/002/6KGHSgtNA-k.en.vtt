step-by-step a process so if you go from

to<00:02:34.690> answer<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.320> problems<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.250> go<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
to answer the problems and you go to a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.950 
to answer the problems and you go to a
scientist<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.030> one<00:02:37.180> specialty<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.870> they'll

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
scientist in one specialty and they'll

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.690 
scientist in one specialty and they'll
say<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.110> know<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.620> problems<00:02:39.070> here<00:02:39.370> but

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
say I know it's all problems here but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.280 
say I know it's all problems here but
after<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.120> they've<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> proved<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.170> all

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
after all they've got it proved in all

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.350 
after all they've got it proved in all
the<00:02:41.410> other<00:02:41.560> areas<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.850> go<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.210> other

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the other areas so you go to the other

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.510 
the other areas so you go to the other
areas<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.050> find<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.160> as<00:02:45.310> bad

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
areas and you find that it's just as bad

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.290 
areas and you find that it's just as bad
or<00:02:45.790> worse<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.380> worst<00:02:47.590> problem<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.400> none

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300

of these things that I mentioned the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.910 
of these things that I mentioned the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
worst problem is that living organisms

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.940
