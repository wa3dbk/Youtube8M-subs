00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.820
 page where there youtube comments 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.660
 Olya Vova don't scare us like that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:26.130
 youtube 10 comments 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.390

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.050

 pick your honestly earned money on 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 looking watching his fit subscribed to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.309
 channel registered one week ago 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.300
 left most likely it is us now 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.910
 check and while I check him I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 I write congratulations 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.040
 congratulations i write him and write him 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:14.700
 secret word and waiting for a letter waiting for a link 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 to the letter to Santa Claus while you answer 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.450
 I'm checking in the feed so we go we go we go 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.400
 further means 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 look it through the comments view 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.619
 All so I hope that the old men who 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 long subscribed channel which is no longer 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.159
 first time participating in the competition 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.299
 really really 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.210
 table follow the rules and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 accordingly well have more chances 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.049
 victory in this plan because they know 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.250
 all the pitfalls they know how it is 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.729
 should work and I think everything will be 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.500
 great we have with you yes or what 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.640

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.119

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.520
 from in response and he tweeted here 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.959

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.770

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.630

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.550
 good by you and continue to congratulate by the way I 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.580
 here I thought that random is random 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.160
 why not if it falls again for example 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.900
 I 'll give him a prize because I don't have 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.640
 no restrictions at least in 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
 we didn't write about the rules on either 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.210
 anyone yes if iphone and ipod on 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.610
 on the next one arrives the same 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.110
 to man it is but it is generally unique 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.330
 it will happen by chance 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.000
 impossible or well according to statistics or 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.290
 probability theory is 0 0 1 some 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 there are thousandths of a percent 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.790
 but no less ipod nano is yours but you are not 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.990
 leave because you're suddenly lucky and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.210
 you can win 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.210
