00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
tank designed during the end of 1943 and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.030 
tank designed during the end of 1943 and
this<00:00:12.389> came<00:00:12.570> about<00:00:12.750> because<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.410> British<00:00:13.710> army

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
this came about because the British army

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.950 
this came about because the British army
wanted<00:00:14.429> an<00:00:14.759> assault<00:00:15.089> tank<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> attack

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
wanted an assault tank so in the attack

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
wanted an assault tank so in the attack
places<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.470> Siegfried<00:00:16.770> line<00:00:16.949> they'd<00:00:17.820> have

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
places like Siegfried line they'd have

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.580 
places like Siegfried line they'd have
something<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.660> pretty<00:00:18.990> much<00:00:19.170> impervious

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
something it was pretty much impervious

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.660 
something it was pretty much impervious
to<00:00:19.920> any<00:00:20.160> German<00:00:20.580> round<00:00:20.820> available<00:00:22.670> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
to any German round available so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 
to any German round available so
Nuffield<00:00:24.210> came<00:00:24.420> off<00:00:24.570> eighteen<00:00:25.019> designs<00:00:25.529> were

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
Nuffield came off eighteen designs were

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.259 
Nuffield came off eighteen designs were
engine<00:00:26.250> from<00:00:26.490> 40<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.300> 80<00:00:27.840> tons<00:00:29.269> this

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
engine from 40 to about 80 tons this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.139 
engine from 40 to about 80 tons this
obviously<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> 15th<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
obviously was the 15th one and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.680 
obviously was the 15th one and
originally<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> 80<00:00:33.540> 15<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:35.070> designed<00:00:35.690> which

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
originally the 80 15 was designed which

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.030 
originally the 80 15 was designed which
look<00:00:36.719> very<00:00:37.079> similar<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.890> they

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
look very similar to this but they

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
look very similar to this but they
basically<00:00:38.160> came<00:00:38.730> back<00:00:39.000> looked<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.510> Zion<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
basically came back looked at Zion and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.490 
basically came back looked at Zion and
modified<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.250> making<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> eighty<00:00:42.420> 15<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
modified it making the eighty 15 a and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.080 
modified it making the eighty 15 a and
while<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> eighty<00:00:44.730> 15<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> 80<00:00:46.230> 15

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
while the eighty 15 a or the 80 15

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.709 
while the eighty 15 a or the 80 15
whenever<00:00:48.090> made<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:50.129> basic<00:00:50.760> design<00:00:50.969> features

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
whenever made the basic design features

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.689 
whenever made the basic design features
were<00:00:52.050> used<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> 80<00:00:53.129> sixteen<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:56.489> was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
were used on the 80 sixteen and that was

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
were used on the 80 sixteen and that was
later<00:00:56.910> renamed<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> 39<00:00:58.230> tortoise<00:01:00.530> okay<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
later renamed the a 39 tortoise okay so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
later renamed the a 39 tortoise okay so
now<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> lego<00:01:02.969> model<00:01:03.149> I'll<00:01:03.449> give<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
now on to the lego model I'll give you a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.450 
now on to the lego model I'll give you a
quick<00:01:04.019> 360<00:01:04.589> degree<00:01:05.250> pan<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.610> usual<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> can

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
quick 360 degree pan as usual as you can

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
quick 360 degree pan as usual as you can
see<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.670> got<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:09.030> unconventional<00:01:09.770> layout

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
see it's got very unconventional layout

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
see it's got very unconventional layout
that's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.520> weird<00:01:11.850> angle<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> very

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's a weird angle it's not very

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.649 
that's a weird angle it's not very
streamlined<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.790> think<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> adds<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
streamlined I think that kind of adds to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
streamlined I think that kind of adds to
its<00:01:15.780> looks<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.009> very

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
its looks I think it's a very

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.730 
its looks I think it's a very
nice-looking<00:01:17.640> tank<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.900> ugly<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.590> I've

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
nice-looking tank very ugly but I've

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
nice-looking tank very ugly but I've
really<00:01:19.979> high<00:01:20.159> court<00:01:20.400> looks<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:22.070> okay<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
really high court looks like okay so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.600 
really high court looks like okay so
I'll<00:01:23.430> show<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> track<00:01:24.180> area<00:01:24.450> first<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'll show the track area first as you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.969 
I'll show the track area first as you
can<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.259> partially<00:01:28.259> overlapping

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
can see it has a partially overlapping

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.330 
can see it has a partially overlapping
wheels<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.579> above<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.960> space<00:01:31.860> side

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
wheels and above it has the space side

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.710 
wheels and above it has the space side
armor<00:01:35.000> now<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> rear<00:01:38.329> some<00:01:39.329> extra

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
armor now on to the rear some extra

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.340 
armor now on to the rear some extra
details<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:41.390> towing<00:01:42.390> areas<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:45.350> obviously

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
details some towing areas and obviously

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.139 
details some towing areas and obviously
the<00:01:46.500> other<00:01:46.710> side<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.939> pretty<00:01:48.659> much<00:01:48.810> identical

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
the other side is pretty much identical

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.639 
the other side is pretty much identical
round<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> front<00:01:52.009> glasses<00:01:53.009> play

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.319 

this<00:01:58.649> piece<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.340> actually

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
this piece here is actually

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.660 
this piece here is actually
intentionally<00:02:00.840> used<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.009> real<00:02:02.430> thing

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
intentionally used on the real thing

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
intentionally used on the real thing
it<00:02:02.939> has<00:02:03.119> bolts<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.049> rivets<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.680> along<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it has bolts or rivets going along the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.639 
it has bolts or rivets going along the
sides<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> top<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.360> plate<00:02:06.689> here<00:02:06.929> so

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
sides and the top of this plate here so

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
sides and the top of this plate here so
that's<00:02:08.459> why<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.670> intentionally<00:02:09.030> use<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that's why I intentionally use that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's why I intentionally use that
plate<00:02:09.750> rather<00:02:10.050> than<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.349> completely

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
plate rather than just completely

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.759 
plate rather than just completely
smoother<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.440> quite<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.650> nice

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
smoother so I think that's quite a nice

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.490 
smoother so I think that's quite a nice
little<00:02:13.800> detail<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.500> superstructure

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
little detail into the superstructure

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.120 
little detail into the superstructure
like<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.360> there's<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:22.130> fake

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
like as you can see there's a fake

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.619 
like as you can see there's a fake
escape<00:02:23.700> hatch<00:02:23.910> there<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.150> engine

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
escape hatch there and on the engine

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:35.210 
escape hatch there and on the engine
deck<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:33.480> might<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.750> also<00:02:34.560> noticed<00:02:35.010> by<00:02:35.190> now

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
deck you might have also noticed by now

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.240 
deck you might have also noticed by now

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
and machine gun in the front here and an

and machine gun in the front here and an
opening<00:03:17.549> hatch<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> minifigure<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:21.030> fence

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269

hollow so fake engine and the terrier

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.819 
hollow so fake engine and the terrier
could<00:03:28.829> be<00:03:28.950> added<00:03:29.329> on<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:31.049> other<00:03:31.200> side<00:03:31.500> there's

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
could be added on the other side there's

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.770 
could be added on the other side there's
another<00:03:31.920> hatch<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.209> opens<00:03:33.569> hatch

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
another hatch and all just opens hatch

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.379 
another hatch and all just opens hatch
so<00:03:34.019> easily<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:35.100> need<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.370> rotate<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.850> machine

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
so easily you need to rotate the machine

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:41.449 
so easily you need to rotate the machine
gun<00:03:36.569> Tara<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.560> as<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.769> can<00:03:40.859> see<00:03:41.069> it's<00:03:41.280> a

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
gun Tara so as you can see it's a

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.309 
gun Tara so as you can see it's a
smaller<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.329> can<00:03:42.480> still<00:03:42.900> fit<00:03:43.139> a

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
smaller one but you can still fit a

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.550 
smaller one but you can still fit a
minifigure<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.920> there

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.830 

there's<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.370> machine<00:03:51.910> gun<00:03:52.090> turret<00:03:52.480> Mountain

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
there's the machine gun turret Mountain

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.900 
there's the machine gun turret Mountain
-<00:03:52.990> machine<00:03:53.380> guns<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:56.080> this<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> got

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
- machine guns so this is a got

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.430 
- machine guns so this is a got
360-degree<00:03:57.910> movement<00:03:58.150> that's<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.960> real

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
360-degree movement that's the real

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.790 
360-degree movement that's the real
thing<00:03:59.620> would<00:03:59.890> have<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.670> also<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.750> feet<00:04:02.560> catch

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
thing would have is also a feet catch

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.630 
thing would have is also a feet catch
another<00:04:03.580> one<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.970> top<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.780> superstructure

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
another one on top of the superstructure

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.860 
another one on top of the superstructure
reason<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.700> didn't<00:04:06.910> make<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.180> button<00:04:07.540> also

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
reason I didn't make this button also

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.830 
reason I didn't make this button also
open<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.380> because<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.770> would<00:04:08.860> break<00:04:09.010> up<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
open is because it would break up the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.930 
open is because it would break up the
design<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.230> wouldn't<00:04:11.500> look<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:11.890> good<00:04:12.460> there

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
design it wouldn't look so good there

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.570 
design it wouldn't look so good there
over<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.780> angle<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:14.860> just<00:04:15.040> left<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.310> non

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
over the angle so I just left that non

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.570 
over the angle so I just left that non
opening<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:17.230> in<00:04:17.410> all<00:04:17.530> I'm<00:04:17.830> really<00:04:18.130> really

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
opening but all in all I'm really really

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.420 
opening but all in all I'm really really
pleased<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> sink<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:20.590> think<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.250> looks

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
pleased for the sink I think it looks

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.300 
pleased for the sink I think it looks
really<00:04:21.730> good<00:04:23.040> really<00:04:24.040> realistic<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:26.520> yeah<00:04:27.810> so

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
really good really realistic and yeah so

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.670 
really good really realistic and yeah so
that's<00:04:30.310> pretty<00:04:30.820> much<00:04:30.910> it

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that's pretty much it

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.470 
that's pretty much it
in<00:04:32.680> case<00:04:32.890> you're<00:04:33.100> wondering<00:04:33.250> here<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:33.970> roughly

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
in case you're wondering here is roughly

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.740 
in case you're wondering here is roughly
what<00:04:35.170> it<00:04:35.200> looks<00:04:35.470> like<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> scale<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:37.720> you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
what it looks like in the scale then you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.900 
what it looks like in the scale then you
compare<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.320> 1:55<00:04:39.100> scale<00:04:39.250> mini<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:39.760> that

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
compare to a 1:55 scale mini for that

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.350 
compare to a 1:55 scale mini for that
sorry<00:04:40.270> figure<00:04:41.010> that's<00:04:42.010> what<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.150> built
