what's<00:02:25.520> unnerving<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.450> silence<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.290> takes

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
what's unnerving is the silence it takes

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.830 
what's unnerving is the silence it takes
some<00:02:27.800> getting<00:02:28.100> used<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.520> suddenly<00:02:29.360> everything

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
some getting used to suddenly everything

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680 
some getting used to suddenly everything
seems<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.740> noisier<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.730> tires<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
seems a lot noisier like the tires the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
seems a lot noisier like the tires the
wind<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.230> even<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.800> sound<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.310> kingdom

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
later as I drove around it was evident

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.300 
later as I drove around it was evident
that<00:02:38.630> there<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.960> ample<00:02:39.260> performance<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.070> tap

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that there was ample performance on tap

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.060 
that there was ample performance on tap
but<00:02:41.300> how's<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.480> possible<00:02:41.690> after<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
but how's that possible after all the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.310 
so the only problem that would remain in
this<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.330> cost<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.810> batteries

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
this is the cost of the batteries

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.680 
this is the cost of the batteries
however<00:04:52.220> renault<00:04:52.580> has<00:04:52.880> found<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.480> way<00:04:53.510> around

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
however renault has found a way around

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.210 
however renault has found a way around
that<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.710> make<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.950> price<00:04:55.220> very<00:04:55.730> attractive

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
that to make the price very attractive

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.890 
that to make the price very attractive
the<00:04:58.220> kiosk<00:04:58.520> will<00:04:58.700> be<00:04:58.820> price<00:04:59.060> at<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.300> same<00:04:59.660> let

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
the kiosk will be price at the same let

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.110 
the kiosk will be price at the same let

price level than the gasoline car the
only<00:05:02.270> difference<00:05:02.480> is<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.960> battery<00:05:03.710> who

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
only difference is that the battery who

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.190 
only difference is that the battery who
believe<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.640> battery<00:05:04.970> least<00:05:05.300> good<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:06.020> the

the daily commute and the second aspect

the daily commute and the second aspect
the<00:05:50.180> biggest<00:05:50.600> aspect<00:05:51.050> according<00:05:51.410> to<00:05:51.500> me<00:05:51.590> has

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
the biggest aspect according to me has

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.040 
the biggest aspect according to me has
been<00:05:51.800> cost<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:52.550> a<00:05:53.030> big<00:05:53.330> chunk<00:05:53.630> of<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.810> has

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
been cost and a big chunk of that has

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.540 
been cost and a big chunk of that has
been<00:05:54.200> taken<00:05:54.470> out<00:05:54.530> by<00:05:54.710> Renault<00:05:54.920> because<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.370> no

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
been taken out by Renault because you no

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.130 
been taken out by Renault because you no
longer<00:05:55.580> by<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.240> batteries<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.960> most

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
longer by the batteries the most

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.920 
longer by the batteries the most
expensive<00:05:57.620> part<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.310> an<00:05:58.700> electric<00:05:59.210> car<00:05:59.390> Uli's

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
expensive part of an electric car Uli's

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.110 
expensive part of an electric car Uli's
them<00:06:00.200> so<00:06:00.650> on<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.800> cost<00:06:01.100> and<00:06:01.310> a<00:06:01.370> yearly<00:06:01.790> ownership

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
them so on a cost and a yearly ownership

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.330 
them so on a cost and a yearly ownership
basis<00:06:02.570> you<00:06:02.900> can<00:06:03.020> actually<00:06:03.260> save<00:06:03.740> money<00:06:03.770> buying

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
basis you can actually save money buying

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.190 
basis you can actually save money buying
electric<00:06:04.910> car<00:06:05.090> so<00:06:05.780> you're<00:06:05.960> going<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.140> be

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
electric car so you're going to be

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.480 
electric car so you're going to be
asking<00:06:06.500> where<00:06:06.650> is<00:06:06.740> this<00:06:06.830> coming<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.220> India

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
asking where is this coming to India

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.490 
asking where is this coming to India
right<00:06:07.640> well<00:06:08.150> it's<00:06:08.600> going<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.840> be<00:06:08.900> a<00:06:08.960> long<00:06:09.200> time

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
right well it's going to be a long time

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
right well it's going to be a long time
because<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:10.100> going<00:06:10.250> to<00:06:10.310> need

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
because it's going to need

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.430 
because it's going to need
infrastructure<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:11.660> governmental<00:06:12.320> support

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
infrastructure and governmental support

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.040 
infrastructure and governmental support
for<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.250> people<00:06:13.550> here<00:06:13.730> in<00:06:13.820> Europe<00:06:14.120> this<00:06:14.480> is<00:06:14.690> a

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
for the people here in Europe this is a

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.770 
for the people here in Europe this is a
very<00:06:15.590> good<00:06:15.650> option<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:16.520> cleaner<00:06:17.060> greener

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
very good option to cleaner greener

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.020 
very good option to cleaner greener
