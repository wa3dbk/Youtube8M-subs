00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.530 

here<00:00:09.720> we<00:00:09.809> go<00:00:09.930> I<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.380> finished<00:00:11.270> assembly<00:00:12.270> of

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
here we go I just finished assembly of

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.570 
here we go I just finished assembly of
this<00:00:12.780> copper<00:00:13.230> top<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.570> surprise<00:00:15.570> surprise<00:00:15.600> is

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
this copper top and surprise surprise is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.750 
this copper top and surprise surprise is
quite<00:00:17.580> happen<00:00:19.340> situation<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.520> water

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
quite happen situation with water

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.470 
quite happen situation with water
cooling<00:00:21.710> problems<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.610> you<00:00:23.700> see<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> screw

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
cooling problems so you see the screw

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.310 
cooling problems so you see the screw
sticking<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:26.239> outside<00:00:27.239> the<00:00:27.300> block<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.050> can

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
sticking out outside the block so I can

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
sticking out outside the block so I can
damage<00:00:28.590> my<00:00:28.800> motherboard<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.669> I<00:00:29.759> leave<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> like

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
damage my motherboard if I leave it like

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.620 
damage my motherboard if I leave it like
this<00:00:30.329> so<00:00:31.259> basically<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.829> is<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> pure

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
this so basically this is the pure

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.350 
this so basically this is the pure
mistake<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:34.050> ek<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.550> engineering<00:00:35.910> mistake

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
mistake from ek like engineering mistake

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.530 
mistake from ek like engineering mistake
you<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.079> sickness<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.240> acetal<00:00:39.240> top

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
you see this sickness of this acetal top

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.880 
you see this sickness of this acetal top
is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.440> few<00:00:41.250> millimeters<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:42.530> than<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is a few millimeters more than the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.960 
is a few millimeters more than the
sickness<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> copper<00:00:45.590> top<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.190> basically<00:00:47.520> as

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
sickness of copper top so basically as

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.240 
sickness of copper top so basically as
ice<00:00:48.390> leads<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.110> fact<00:00:49.380> that<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.860> screw

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
ice leads to the fact that my screw

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
ice leads to the fact that my screw
sticking<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.990> sort<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
sticking out so I need some sort of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.090 
sticking out so I need some sort of
spacers<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.150> in<00:00:54.150> order<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.690> leave<00:00:55.410> screws<00:00:55.770> up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
spacers here in order to leave screws up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.990 
spacers here in order to leave screws up
or<00:00:57.230> shorter<00:00:58.230> screws<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.130> beware<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.850> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
or shorter screws so beware if you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.100 
or shorter screws so beware if you
decide<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.950> mode<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> will

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
decide to the mode I'm doing you will

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
decide to the mode I'm doing you will
have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.710> deal<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:06.090> solution

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
have to deal with this so my solution

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
have to deal with this so my solution
will<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> heavy<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.950> than<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
will be a heavy more than I need the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
will be a heavy more than I need the
mounting<00:01:09.479> plates<00:01:09.810> installed<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.670> will

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
mounting plates installed so I just will

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.599 
mounting plates installed so I just will
borrow<00:01:12.179> couple<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.969> just<00:01:14.969> tag<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:16.079> together

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
borrow couple and just tag them together

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.160 
borrow couple and just tag them together
it<00:01:17.630> will<00:01:18.630> look<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.469> solve<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.310> problem

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
it will look good and solve my problem

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.039 
it will look good and solve my problem
but<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.729> box<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.539> solution

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
but you see out of the box the solution

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
but you see out of the box the solution
would<00:01:25.229> wouldn't<00:01:25.590> work<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:28.189> good<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> size

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
would wouldn't work so good to size

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
would wouldn't work so good to size
checked<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.920> how<00:01:32.039> you<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.840> have

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
checked and that's how you know I have

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.199 
checked and that's how you know I have
to<00:01:34.020> use<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.999> three<00:01:36.469> back<00:01:37.469> plate<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.969> order

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
to use a three back plate here in order

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.599 
to use a three back plate here in order
to<00:01:39.359> make<00:01:39.659> sure<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:40.139> screws<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.219> sticking

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
to make sure that screws not sticking

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.980 
to make sure that screws not sticking
out<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> did<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.819> where<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.359> look<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
out so did it where to look for the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.779 
out so did it where to look for the
supreme<00:01:46.409> block<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> flat<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.490> can

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
supreme block it's kind of flat you can

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.550 
supreme block it's kind of flat you can
see<00:01:51.029> this<00:01:53.719> but<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.909> area<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.779> good

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
see this but it's pretty area so good

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.340 
see this but it's pretty area so good
potential<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.249> the<00:01:59.579> cooling<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.869> we'll<00:02:01.079> see

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
potential for the cooling so we'll see

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.339 
potential for the cooling so we'll see
how<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.619> will<00:02:01.799> perform<00:02:02.569> but<00:02:03.569> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
how it will perform but this is the

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.940 
how it will perform but this is the
final<00:02:04.679> assembly<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.789> me<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.799> expect<00:02:07.799> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
final assembly for me and expect that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700 
final assembly for me and expect that
the<00:02:08.009> result<00:02:08.810> that's<00:02:09.810> policy

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
the result that's policy

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:20.920 
the result that's policy
you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.989 

you
