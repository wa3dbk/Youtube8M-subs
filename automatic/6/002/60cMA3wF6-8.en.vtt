you can tell it's recording what I'm
picking<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.299> i<00:01:24.720> am<00:01:25.070> using<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
picking up because i am using a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.620 
picking up because i am using a
different<00:01:26.610> program<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.090> record<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.450> audio

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
different program to record my audio

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870 
different program to record my audio
that's<00:01:28.530> recording<00:01:29.009> video<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> same<00:01:29.460> time

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that's recording video at the same time

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
that's recording video at the same time
so<00:01:30.240> um<00:01:32.150> basically<00:01:33.150> stop<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> want

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so um basically stop this when you want

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
so um basically stop this when you want
to<00:01:34.710> export<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> file<00:01:35.820> export<00:01:36.140> it'll

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to export it you go to file export it'll

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.240 
to export it you go to file export it'll
give<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> stuff<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:37.979> name<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
give you the stuff you can name I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
give you the stuff you can name I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
case I don't have anything so I'm just

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
going to go here to fall out and we're

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.490 
going to go here to fall out and we're
just<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> assume<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.500> actually

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
just going to assume that this actually

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.570 
just going to assume that this actually
I<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:25.920> know<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.069> they'll<00:02:26.220> let<00:02:26.250> me<00:02:28.580> because

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I don't know if they'll let me because

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.809 
I don't know if they'll let me because
it's<00:02:29.610> an<00:02:29.910> MPEG<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.690> won't<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.260> um<00:02:31.860> let's

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it's an MPEG so it won't so um let's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.440 
it's an MPEG so it won't so um let's
just<00:02:33.060> assume<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.769> which<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.760> an

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
just assume that this which is an

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.780 
just assume that this which is an
earlier<00:02:37.049> tutorial<00:02:37.709> video<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.250> hasn't

is<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.720> xbox<00:02:42.989> video<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.500> trying<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:44.239> get<00:02:45.239> in

is the xbox video I'm trying to get in
so<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.650> drag<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.099> video<00:02:47.430> one

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
so I'm going to drag this to video one

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.550 
so I'm going to drag this to video one
as<00:02:47.849> you<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.780> tell<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> bring<00:02:49.410> all

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
as you can tell it's going to bring all

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
as you can tell it's going to bring all
this<00:02:49.680> stuff<00:02:49.739> up<00:02:50.040> off<00:02:50.430> its<00:02:50.670> an<00:02:50.760> xbox<00:02:51.180> video<00:02:51.329> or

this stuff up off its an xbox video or

this stuff up off its an xbox video or
something<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.620> know<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.040> nature<00:02:53.370> like

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
something you know to that nature like

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.599 
something you know to that nature like
ps3<00:02:55.099> no<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.129> did<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:56.760> want<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> um<00:02:58.609> you're

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
ps3 no I did not want that um you're

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.710 
ps3 no I did not want that um you're
going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> want<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.000> change<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.269> dimensions

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
going to want to change the dimensions

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
going to want to change the dimensions
to<00:03:00.900> 720<00:03:01.530> x<00:03:01.650> 480<00:03:03.709> otherwise<00:03:04.709> it'll<00:03:05.069> come<00:03:05.250> out

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to 720 x 480 otherwise it'll come out

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610 
to 720 x 480 otherwise it'll come out
looking<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.700> little<00:03:05.849> bit<00:03:06.000> smaller<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.620> even

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
looking a little bit smaller so even

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.140 
looking a little bit smaller so even
though<00:03:07.709> those<00:03:07.859> are<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.160> dimensions<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
though those are the dimensions that I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.180 
though those are the dimensions that I
recorded<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.840> we're<00:03:10.319> going<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.500> assume<00:03:10.859> that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
recorded in we're going to assume that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.910 
recorded in we're going to assume that
for<00:03:11.489> sake<00:03:11.730> sake<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.329> an<00:03:12.720> xbox<00:03:13.109> video<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
for sake sake this is an xbox video so

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.860 
for sake sake this is an xbox video so
there<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.430> we're<00:03:15.329> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> zoom<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.750> is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
there you go we're going to zoom this is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.020 
there you go we're going to zoom this is
the<00:03:15.989> xbox<00:03:16.169> video<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.889> I<00:03:16.919> do<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.549> dragged<00:03:17.819> in

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the xbox video what I do is I dragged in

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.569 
the xbox video what I do is I dragged in
a<00:03:18.269> little<00:03:18.780> thing<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.019> call<00:03:19.049> i<00:03:19.319> named<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.829> block<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
a little thing I call i named a block it

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.860 
a little thing I call i named a block it
is<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.819> 1<00:03:21.590> 1<00:03:22.590> 2nd<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.639> 10<00:03:23.760> frames<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.450> blank

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
is a 1 1 2nd and 10 frames of blank

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.159 
is a 1 1 2nd and 10 frames of blank
audio<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.620> usually<00:03:26.609> put<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.389> down<00:03:28.109> here<00:03:30.169> so

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
audio I usually put this in down here so

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.220 
audio I usually put this in down here so
basically<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.389> second<00:03:33.660> block<00:03:33.930> of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
basically it's a one second block of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.580 
basically it's a one second block of
audio<00:03:34.530> we're<00:03:35.519> going<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.700> assume<00:03:35.790> that

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
audio we're going to assume that

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280 
audio we're going to assume that
tutorial<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:38.010> which<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.060> saw<00:03:39.239> earlier<00:03:39.419> is<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
tutorial to which you saw earlier is the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.099 
tutorial to which you saw earlier is the
audio<00:03:40.620> i<00:03:40.680> recorded<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.310> audacity<00:03:42.019> we're<00:03:43.019> going

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
audio i recorded in audacity we're going

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.430 
audio i recorded in audacity we're going
to<00:03:43.169> drag<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.919> here<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.930> my<00:03:46.169> audio

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
to drag this down here that is my audio

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.199 
to drag this down here that is my audio
even<00:03:46.650> though<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.829> doesn't<00:03:46.980> match<00:03:47.220> up<00:03:47.250> we're

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
even though it doesn't match up we're

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.839 
even though it doesn't match up we're
just<00:03:48.329> going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.540> assume<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.549> the

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
just going to assume that that's the

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.729 
just going to assume that that's the
audio<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.359> we'll<00:03:51.660> match<00:03:51.840> up<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.079> one<00:03:52.380> second

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
audio and we'll match up the one second

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.440 
audio and we'll match up the one second
block<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.160> some<00:03:53.280> reason<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.669> found<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.180> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
block for some reason I found is that it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.319 
block for some reason I found is that it
matches<00:03:54.629> up<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.669> audio<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:56.879> video<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> lot

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
matches up the audio and video a lot

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.780 
matches up the audio and video a lot
better<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:58.530> some<00:03:58.709> reason<00:03:59.069> even<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.579> hit

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
better for some reason even if you hit

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.330 
better for some reason even if you hit
record<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.419> audio<00:04:00.620> after<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:02.010> video<00:04:02.190> was

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
recording it still comes up kind of

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.080 
recording it still comes up kind of
messed<00:04:04.739> up<00:04:04.919> so<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.220> one<00:04:05.340> second<00:04:05.639> block<00:04:05.849> kind

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
messed up so the one second block kind

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.879 
messed up so the one second block kind
of<00:04:06.180> evens<00:04:06.419> it<00:04:06.540> out<00:04:06.629> you're<00:04:07.410> probably<00:04:07.650> going<00:04:07.829> to
