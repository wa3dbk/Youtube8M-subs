checking<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.509> see<00:00:06.720> if<00:00:06.750> your<00:00:07.049> CPU<00:00:07.440> works<00:00:08.840> using

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
checking to see if your CPU works using

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.129 
checking to see if your CPU works using
a<00:00:10.050> 12-volt<00:00:10.469> battery<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.450> had<00:00:12.450> some<00:00:12.660> computer

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
a 12-volt battery I had some computer

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.180 
a 12-volt battery I had some computer
issues<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:14.580> diagnosing<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:16.190> computer

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
issues and I was diagnosing my computer

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.090 
issues and I was diagnosing my computer
see<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.210> problem<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.890> thought<00:00:20.039> I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
see what the problem was and I thought I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.720 
see what the problem was and I thought I
could<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> 12<00:00:21.330> volt<00:00:21.539> battery<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.730> see

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
could just use a 12 volt battery to see

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.620 
could just use a 12 volt battery to see
if<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:23.970> fans<00:00:24.269> were<00:00:24.449> working<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> used<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
if my fans were working so I used a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
if my fans were working so I used a
motorcycle<00:00:27.630> battery<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.439> hooked<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
motorcycle battery and hooked up to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.600 
motorcycle battery and hooked up to
wires<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> battery<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.369> has

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
wires from the battery and then this has

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.740 
wires from the battery and then this has
a<00:00:32.640> black<00:00:33.920> black<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> red<00:00:35.250> wires<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.629> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a black black and red wires so this is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.580 
a black black and red wires so this is
the<00:00:39.899> simple<00:00:40.260> electric<00:00:40.530> motor<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> checked

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the simple electric motor so I checked

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
the simple electric motor so I checked
it<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> fan<00:00:44.489> work<00:00:45.950> I<00:00:46.950> tried<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> wires

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it and the fan work I tried the wires

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
it and the fan work I tried the wires
both<00:00:49.170> ways<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:53.030> electrical<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
both ways in the electrical and so it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
both ways in the electrical and so it
makes<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> run<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
makes more to run one way and if you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
makes more to run one way and if you
switch<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> wires<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.030> run<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.510> way

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
switch the wires it run to other way

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
switch the wires it run to other way
well<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> didn't<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:03.329> soon<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
well it didn't like that as soon as I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
well it didn't like that as soon as I
put<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> computer<00:01:04.439> together<00:01:04.760> gave<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> error

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
put the computer together gave a error

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.590 
put the computer together gave a error
saying<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.960> CPU<00:01:07.380> fan<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> failed<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
saying the CPU fan and failed and a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.789 
saying the CPU fan and failed and a
computer<00:01:10.080> shutdown<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.549> work<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> using

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
computer shutdown and one work so using

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.789 
computer shutdown and one work so using
a<00:01:16.920> 12<00:01:17.250> volt<00:01:17.460> battery<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> way<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
a 12 volt battery is not the way to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.730 
a 12 volt battery is not the way to
check<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.600> CPU<00:01:21.600> fan<00:01:22.100> or<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.780> desktop<00:01:24.780> box

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
check your CPU fan or your desktop box

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.450 
check your CPU fan or your desktop box
fan<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> check<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.220> take<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
fan the way to check it is is to take a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.359 
fan the way to check it is is to take a
side<00:01:29.790> cover<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.530> your<00:01:31.530> desktop<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> when<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
side cover off your desktop and when you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.550 
side cover off your desktop and when you
start<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> computer<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> fans<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.930> start

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560
