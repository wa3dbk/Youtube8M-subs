00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
track of 146 inches yeah I know who'd

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.120 
track of 146 inches yeah I know who'd
have<00:02:00.880> thought<00:02:01.030> one<00:02:01.299> inch<00:02:01.479> would<00:02:01.689> go<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.110> far<00:02:02.140> so

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
have thought one inch would go so far so

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.590 
have thought one inch would go so far so
let's<00:02:03.310> get<00:02:03.429> back<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.789> my<00:02:03.909> original<00:02:04.000> thought

the area's they ride in come on let's be

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.789 
the area's they ride in come on let's be
honest<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.450> ourselves<00:02:22.569> pulling<00:02:23.500> up<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.769> a

summit<00:02:24.160> might<00:02:24.459> look<00:02:24.640> cool<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.599> usability

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
summit might look cool but the usability

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.240 
of all that track and log in flatland
areas<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.780> minimal<00:02:29.319> when<00:02:29.500> compared<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.040> what
