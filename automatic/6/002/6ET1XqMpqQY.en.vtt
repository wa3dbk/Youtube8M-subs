 she is vitally optimistic and passionate about being 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.779
 actress is now immersed in a new 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.340
 theatrical project and precisely in the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.340
 theater we have stayed with her 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.020
 Clear Lake is savoring this moment 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.090
 so sweet thanks to the movie more 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.310
 box office of the eight Spanish cinema 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.320
 Basque last names that's why he wanted 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.869
 embark on this new adventure the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.060
 theater the venus of the skins is its 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.640
 second play and plays a 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.470
 young pirate actress and something crazy that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.300
 does not stop in a moment the almost two hours 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.520
 that is in scenes I'm changing 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.379
 but all the mouse scene in montorio 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.550
 grant the couch and good or whether I 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.239
 running from one side to the other 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.600
 stage for a while yes yes no that's 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.040
 almost like a marathon every day that I do 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.890
 this because in team this scenario that 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.050
 is so long at 24 years old is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.520
 considered as the fashion actress something 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.320
 that flatters him but that at the same time 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.700
 that does not go to his head this I 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.489
 I always say that the seven 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.350
 new psuv always for wolf but but 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.800
 Well, yes, I like fashion, but I 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.190
 they like love in a way like more 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.190
 private private not do not follow the fashion in 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.790
 how to follow the trends buy me 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.080
 to fashion magazines and go as to 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.640
 roll of what they mark they would 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.220
 they put the adaptation that fascinated me 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 the world of heels but the truth 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.020
 which is very uncomfortable or then I would 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 I have to go to several of several events 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.660
 or parties whatever it is for not supporting more 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.690
 foot pain and this is something that already 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.090
 I'm not nothing crazy about shopping or 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.850
 have been defined more as it is as 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.500
 ritual when we were younger and with 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 13 years or so but 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.930
 in fact it also overwhelms me at times like 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.580
 want and especially the sites that are 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 like other things if suddenly you 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.450
 you find time dating to simona if 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.820
 you go to gossip this I'm going 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.680
 shopping but I'm going to the street of the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.830
 stores with the history shopping center 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.690
 it seems to me like the horror although in its 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.220
 day by day he usually dresses in a very 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.679
 carefree for his appearances 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.300
 public is always right and it is that clear 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.030
 he is advised by professionals 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.520
 you trust in a basic years 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.040
 that the other three years did to go to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.590
 final has been chosen I like it a lot 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.650
 was to go the truth but then for example 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.930
 Ã¡lex vidal with alessio had very good 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.270
 relationship also has even reached me
