00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.529
 best body nutrition 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 sports fans there is a need for action 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.160
 Today I'll show you the so-called 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 Cable pulls or table crossovers detects 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 Maybe if you're in the gym 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.119
 trains the so-called lift for the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 Muscles on two cable stations 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.640
 stand 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.879
 Take a quick break 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.519
 only friends should spend 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.809
 I see this exercise most often and 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.220
 most often wrong i have the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.699
 most adventurous variants of it 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.680
 seen 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.970
 you can not imagine she is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.140
 in principle quite simple ok I take time 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.229
 reaches forward 3 the elbows 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 a bit out of just the right wrist 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.760
 stay fixed again here too 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.519
 therefore only a little bit moved forward 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.159
 there it was ok and now you are coming 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:10.280
 below says exactly and stand together 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 breast exactly 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 okay, we'll look self-confident here later 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.990
 on 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 important is also the angle of the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.190
 Poor is almost the same and as you can see 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 do not cross your hands 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.490
 you do not have to do that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 but there are together and here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.290
 has your maximum cooperation on the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 Breast tries for a short time over 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.420
 because they have to cross 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.010
 Manufacturing to change is a lot 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810
 more difficult to perform and also brings 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.770
 no more 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.820
 if anything it is only from 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.640
 nature progressed very much 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.170
 advanced suitable says so much 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.990
 theoretically , you, too, followed you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.850
 you gay and with it to contract yes 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 should under circumstances even more tension 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.280
 Bring on the chest I advise you to do so 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.110
 just times 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.580
 she said to zac like that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.070
 so called bosma skoda pose im 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.740
 bodybuilding push together class like that 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.970
 christmas break please show us now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
 the camera still what we change 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.519
 Could we know the angle of the work 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.659
 me since I ask you to do it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.840
 just like you did 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.830
 could provided after he has exactly 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.880
 Here's what we do 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.550
 Could be the angle 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.680
 poor change so the farther we high 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.640
 come the more we are top because 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.850
 breast region 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 get further down and maybe 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 straighten up again 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 Now we are in the lower one 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.740
 ok time region then again quickly 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 fight from top to bottom right here 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:45.760
 there is therefore in a line with the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.920
 kabel turns the elbe upwards from exactly 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.570
 and now you never get together 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.680
 right in front of the belly what you do now 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.660
 Could you do the album bit 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.550
 Create more if you have come up 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.100
 you 'll see the most robust ones already 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.120
 Now I'll save that down again 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.950
 Here we are more in the lower area 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.880
 as supported here a boy 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.680
 with but does often save up already fixed 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.130
 to see clearly like the chest muscles 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.210
 Well, so now I too 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.240
 not again 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.950
 [Laughter] 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.270
 those together 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.680
 Pay attention to your wrist that's in there 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.290
 stay as soon as I am here enough 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.160
 loses its tension on the chest and 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.160
 together probably because I have said all 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.160
 Are you that one again ? 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.260
 not yet it is all aware 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.210
 tenses the muscles tightly 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.240
 just do not weight too much there is always 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.240
 at the expense of technology yes ok 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:04:03.580
 [Music] 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.090
 Sports fans whether you go there 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.100
 or whether ye earlier or the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.480
 You just have to step back 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.720
 try yourself important that you 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.440
 your muscles consciously feel it 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.790
 practice the dead tense and as well as the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.320
 high speed I can only say 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.300
 try it 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.020
 You can be heavy weight too 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.370
 take consciously and dynamically with 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.200
 work a little bit or you take 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.380
 just a moderate weight and 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
 works consciously into the muscle 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.310
 he'll certainly be second in the beginning 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.740
 variant better suited learn yours 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.450
 consciously to feel muscle and not 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.480
 to move any huge weights 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.720
 How did you like it was fun 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.840
 tried exercises in the studio at home 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.030
 has somehow felt different 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.890
 If you give a report I need feedback 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.970
 not improve or my grandpa brother 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.590
 says what writes to this video one 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.110
 commentator defeated the three of what 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:08.089
 Whatever I mean, yes 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.089
