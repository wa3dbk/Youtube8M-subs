the strip's remember some kielbasas have
different<00:01:09.119> size<00:01:09.390> pieces<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.560> meat<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
different size pieces of meat this is a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.679 
different size pieces of meat this is a
size<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.689> chosen<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.439> kielbasa<00:01:14.689> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
size I've chosen for this kielbasa you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.010 
size I've chosen for this kielbasa you
can<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.040> move<00:01:17.250> forward<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.360> size<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can see as I move forward the size of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.789 
can see as I move forward the size of
beet<00:01:19.320> chunks<00:01:20.420> if<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.780> were<00:01:21.930> making<00:01:22.320> something

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
beet chunks if I were making something

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280

something sizes like this and then have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.060 
something sizes like this and then have
larger<00:01:29.040> pieces<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.909> ID's<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.799> about

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
larger pieces and ID's also think about

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
larger pieces and ID's also think about
putting<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:32.729> smaller<00:01:33.090> stuff<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
putting in some smaller stuff this is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.800 
putting in some smaller stuff this is
what<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> looks<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> close-up

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
what it looks like this is a close-up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.240 
what it looks like this is a close-up
