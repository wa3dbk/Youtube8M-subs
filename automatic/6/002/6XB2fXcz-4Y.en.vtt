welcome<00:00:03.800> back<00:00:03.950> in<00:00:04.220> this<00:00:04.760> segment<00:00:04.970> I<00:00:05.270> will<00:00:05.330> be

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
welcome back in this segment I will be

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.950 
welcome back in this segment I will be
getting<00:00:05.810> the<00:00:06.109> research<00:00:06.500> camera<00:00:07.069> and<00:00:07.900> taking<00:00:08.900> a

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
getting the research camera and taking a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.539 
getting the research camera and taking a
picture<00:00:09.170> of<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:09.470> first<00:00:09.710> of<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.040> three<00:00:10.280> spider

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
picture of the first of the three spider

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:35.190 
picture of the first of the three spider
slicers

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.770 

this<00:00:36.200> first<00:00:36.500> camera<00:00:36.860> up<00:00:37.130> here<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.640> much<00:00:38.570> too

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
this first camera up here is much too

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.070 
this first camera up here is much too
high<00:00:38.960> up<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.350> hack<00:00:39.590> or<00:00:39.920> hit<00:00:40.280> with<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.520> wrench

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
high up to hack or hit with the wrench

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.410 
high up to hack or hit with the wrench
so<00:00:42.080> instead<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.560> just<00:00:43.010> destroy<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.970> by<00:00:44.150> throwing

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
so instead I just destroy it by throwing

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.930 
so instead I just destroy it by throwing
a<00:00:44.570> big<00:00:44.720> daddy<00:00:44.960> at<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:47.860> it<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.220> possible<00:00:49.880> to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
a big daddy at it it is possible to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:06.140 
a big daddy at it it is possible to
simply<00:00:50.720> avoid<00:00:51.790> but<00:00:52.790> it's<00:00:53.060> pretty<00:00:53.390> hard

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.700 

however<00:01:07.150> this<00:01:07.330> second<00:01:07.869> camera<00:01:08.170> up<00:01:08.260> here<00:01:08.530> is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
however this second camera up here is

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:20.840 
however this second camera up here is
quite<00:01:09.040> hackable

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.670 

the<00:01:21.850> research<00:01:22.300> camera<00:01:22.780> looks<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.230> like<00:01:23.440> what

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
the research camera looks just like what

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.740 
the research camera looks just like what
you'd<00:01:23.800> see<00:01:23.830> top<00:01:24.250> site<00:01:24.550> according<00:01:25.480> to<00:01:25.630> this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
you'd see top site according to this

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.960 
you'd see top site according to this

also<00:01:28.150> analyze<00:01:29.160> genetic<00:01:30.160> information

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
also analyze genetic information

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.830 
also analyze genetic information
biological<00:01:32.800> structures<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.640> lot<00:01:34.480> of<00:01:34.690> other

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.200 

as<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.890> enter<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.550> little<00:01:47.360> maze<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.810> turrets

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
as you enter this little maze of turrets

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.060 
as you enter this little maze of turrets
some<00:01:50.210> slicers<00:01:50.720> will<00:01:51.170> show<00:01:51.470> up<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.860> try<00:01:51.950> to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
some slicers will show up and try to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.910 
some slicers will show up and try to
disrupt<00:01:52.670> your<00:01:52.880> progress<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:54.500> if<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.710> move

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
disrupt your progress but if you move

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.150 
disrupt your progress but if you move
quick<00:01:55.400> enough<00:01:56.260> your<00:01:57.260> turrets<00:01:57.740> will<00:01:57.890> actually

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
quick enough your turrets will actually

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.700 
quick enough your turrets will actually
take<00:01:58.310> care<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.610> them

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.210 

I<00:02:01.880> also<00:02:02.880> sort<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.530> coaxed<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.650> turret<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.010> just

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
I also sort of coaxed the turret I just

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.150 
I also sort of coaxed the turret I just
hacked<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.030> RPG<00:02:06.420> jar<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.160> into

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
hacked the RPG jar right there into

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.550 
hacked the RPG jar right there into
destroying<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.970> regular<00:02:09.869> turf<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.350> just

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
destroying the regular turf that's just

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.699 
destroying the regular turf that's just
ahead<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.800> me<00:02:11.900> because<00:02:12.900> it'll<00:02:13.440> probably

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
ahead of me because it'll probably

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.030 
ahead of me because it'll probably
destroy<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.310> freaking<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> hack<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.000> anyway

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.339 

and<00:02:19.040> he<00:02:19.189> might<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.489> well<00:02:19.670> do<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.299> standing<00:02:21.110> off

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
and he might as well do it standing off

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.929 
and he might as well do it standing off
to<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.560> side<00:02:21.650> instead<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.640> year<00:02:22.760> right

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
to the side instead of one year right

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:34.780 
to the side instead of one year right
next<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.420> it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.420 

there<00:02:35.450> are<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.689> couple<00:02:35.769> first<00:02:36.769> aid<00:02:36.980> kits<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
there are a couple first aid kits in the

there are a couple first aid kits in the
wall<00:02:37.640> right<00:02:37.879> there<00:02:39.129> and<00:02:40.129> also<00:02:40.459> make<00:02:40.819> sure<00:02:40.849> you

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
that violation I do use the camera quite

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.530 
that violation I do use the camera quite
a<00:03:42.600> bit<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:44.190> not<00:03:44.730> only<00:03:44.760> does<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.180> give<00:03:45.300> you

pretty much every enemy but it'll also
give<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.150> other<00:03:51.300> rewards<00:03:51.960> such<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.410> tonics<00:03:53.190> or
