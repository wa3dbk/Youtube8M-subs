00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.910
 Hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.350
 always crayfish in the hangar and today I want 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.690
 tell the average american tanker 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.710
 m2 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:36.770
 then it is the fifth level of the receiving tank 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.940
 cost it how much was there at 300 with something 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.270
 rubles in the set there in gold with a slot 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.610
 in the hangar in general honestly there 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.250
 he has quite a good weapon 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:56.470
 how many have he got now 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.379
 67 312 choose 79 and 331 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.920
 fire rate of 1644 to be honest 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.400
 this 4 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.170
 soviet rate of fire and damage 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.060
 better 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.770
 so I was looking for something like an example and there 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.600
 where they are always a little worse but 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.710
 headlights 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 of equipment but nothing yet 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.200
 put the gear 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.880
 first aid kit there as always standard 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.799
 no rammer yet I don't want 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.149
 they go it seems to me here it is impossible 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.380
 pass it can not I collected carib 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.909
 let's try to roll one fight 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 to show what he is 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.039
 presents in battle first plus this 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.039
 tank 1 that he is constantly in the top and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.530
 what and what in this case his head is not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.600
 always beat 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.659
 although t28 can with his gun top and 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.830
 how did you get that quick-fire with 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.980
 so here 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.110
 landmines this tank is not for low 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.070
 levels you can not charge a landmine and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.170
 not afraid to shoot at him, and it is not 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.160
 It is necessary because the gun and really 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.160
 rapid-fire weapon 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.840
 charge a landmine even a few 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.360
 so shocked now you see what he 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.660
 it is also about us bt-7 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 punch but true board to power 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.970
 a little bit I substituted 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.810
 if there are lags i'm sorry 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.130
 such a program I can not do so 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.470
 I probably converge about him without crying 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.560
 he could not shot because as where 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.730
 it's it's a stump and we like 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:53.060
 find not really breaks through all this and 4 already 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060
 in the hangar 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.380
 so now let's see what 32 but he, too 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 we will not break through because he has 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.230
 the same instrument as this 20. 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.390
 because she is not breaking through 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.900
 instead of him lucky he will surely fall 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.880
 some weak spot for problems 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.470
 ricochets karma okay we take it all 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:31.040
 him 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.840
 Now t28 principle remains the case for 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 small 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:42.560
 only two left to the tower but one already 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:45.730
 already three lives left even less well 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.730
 victory is in your pocket . 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.249
 ram and ram on him more or less by vitya 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:57.540
 he is with this cannon pierce me 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:04:01.739
 Stream it is even higher than that to me so 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.400
 You can try the tower as a start and 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.790
 just no I think it's better to go for 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.790
 bottom 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.090
 I will shoot there too 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.709
 wanna stay this bubble most likely he 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.180
 I was still walking 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.610
 your every one doesn't make it into these but 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.280
 we calm him even but anywhere 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.730
 My principle block shelf need to shoot 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.650
 but if fishing meets all two 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.870
 heads beat him already played everything now 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.020
 left to finish 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:48.540
 4 then I already have mane again 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:53.170
 There is no editing I just play 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:05:02.140
 randomly ie i while recording video 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:05.500
 I play so where we have the same job as 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.280
 and talked about over each come on this 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.970
 the gun is gold but she does not give him 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.970
 needed because he and so all punch 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:25.600
 here are five frags to whom is the radley medal 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:29.820
 Walters yes already twice for enough took 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.190
 About the blue sorry I did not write 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:39.010
 war festival ridley issue up to 1700 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:41.890
 952 experience damage quite normal 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.979
 result for the fifth level of the tank 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.960
 there is he can bend but he is not 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:51.160
 of particular interest because 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.400
 it is no different from t34 even t-34 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.930
 more so mobile more dpm her then 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 I, too, would prefer 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.120
 soviet tank t-34 20 grandfathers fought and we 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.350
