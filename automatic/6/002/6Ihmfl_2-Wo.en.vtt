00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
there's one spline that is flat and it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
there's one spline that is flat and it
only<00:00:07.290> goes<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.589> one<00:00:07.649> way<00:00:09.679> turn<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.800> until<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
only goes on one way turn of until the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:21.380 
only goes on one way turn of until the
dots<00:00:11.370> line<00:00:11.670> up<00:00:19.670> okay<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> two
