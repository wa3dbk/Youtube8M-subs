00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
then you get the flow data a couple

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.130 
then you get the flow data a couple
things<00:01:17.030> I've<00:01:17.240> noticed<00:01:17.360> about<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.870> pump

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
things I've noticed about this pump

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.140 
things I've noticed about this pump
comparing<00:01:18.620> this<00:01:18.770> flow<00:01:19.010> data<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.460> other<00:01:19.640> pumps

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
comparing this flow data to other pumps

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.990 
comparing this flow data to other pumps
is<00:01:20.330> how<00:01:20.960> linear<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.340> generally<00:01:22.880> speaking

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
is how linear this is generally speaking

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.450 
is how linear this is generally speaking
with<00:01:23.420> most<00:01:23.630> aftermarket<00:01:23.780> pumps<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.010> increase

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
with most aftermarket pumps you increase

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.700 
with most aftermarket pumps you increase
the<00:01:25.610> PSI<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.090> increase<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.660> amperage<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.230> at

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
the PSI you increase the amperage and at

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.620 
the PSI you increase the amperage and at
some<00:01:27.950> point<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.490> fuel<00:01:28.760> flow<00:01:28.970> just<00:01:29.210> literally

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
some point the fuel flow just literally

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.560 
some point the fuel flow just literally
falls<00:01:29.930> off<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.170> cliff<00:01:30.320> where<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.340> one<00:01:31.700> you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
falls off a cliff where this one you

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.149 
falls off a cliff where this one you
know<00:01:32.690> if<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.930> compare<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> side-by-side<00:01:33.440> to

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
know if you compare it side-by-side to

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.860 
know if you compare it side-by-side to
another<00:01:34.400> aftermarket<00:01:34.970> pump<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.480> pump<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
another aftermarket pump this pump the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.899 
another aftermarket pump this pump the
higher<00:01:36.050> psi<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.680> get<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.460> fuel<00:01:37.700> flow

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
higher psi you get the fuel flow

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.210 
higher psi you get the fuel flow
actually<00:01:38.060> starts<00:01:38.480> catching<00:01:38.750> up<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
actually starts catching up to the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.590 
actually starts catching up to the
higher<00:01:40.400> flowing<00:01:40.790> pumps<00:01:41.090> which<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.330> just

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
higher flowing pumps which is just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.260 
higher flowing pumps which is just
incredible<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:43.040> thought<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.790> was<00:01:43.909> really

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
incredible so I thought that was really

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.420 
incredible so I thought that was really
cool<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:45.470> course<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.920> wanted<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.250> show<00:01:46.400> you

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.430 
cool and of course I wanted to show you
guys<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.940> pump<00:01:47.210> itself<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:48.350> I'm

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
guys the pump itself this is what I'm

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.190 
guys the pump itself this is what I'm
really<00:01:48.530> excited<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:49.040> show<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.630> alright<00:01:50.630> so

here<00:01:51.409> we<00:01:51.560> go<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:53.050> 265<00:01:54.050> liter<00:01:54.650> per<00:01:54.860> hour

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
here we go the 265 liter per hour

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.840 
here we go the 265 liter per hour
DW<00:01:56.150> 65<00:01:56.750> C<00:01:57.020> now<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.710> blows<00:01:57.920> me<00:01:58.100> away<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.310> just<00:01:58.610> how

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
DW 65 C now it blows me away is just how

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.149 
DW 65 C now it blows me away is just how
much<00:01:59.090> flow<00:01:59.570> they're<00:02:00.170> able<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.710> get<00:02:00.920> out<00:02:01.010> of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
much flow they're able to get out of

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.680 
much flow they're able to get out of
this<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:01.760> reason<00:02:02.150> being<00:02:02.299> is<00:02:02.450> they<00:02:02.540> actually

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
this now reason being is they actually

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.899 
this now reason being is they actually
have<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.960> very<00:02:03.170> special<00:02:03.740> high<00:02:03.950> torque<00:02:04.310> motor<00:02:04.610> in

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
have a very special high torque motor in

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.090 
have a very special high torque motor in
here<00:02:05.150> now<00:02:05.659> it's<00:02:05.870> also<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.320> turbine<00:02:06.830> impeller

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
here now it's also a turbine impeller

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.650 
here now it's also a turbine impeller
design<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:07.820> gonna<00:02:07.909> work<00:02:08.119> with<00:02:08.330> your<00:02:08.509> own

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
design so it's gonna work with your own

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.180 
design so it's gonna work with your own
pump<00:02:08.990> controller<00:02:09.350> which<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.560> always<00:02:09.950> very

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
pump controller which is always very

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.690 
pump controller which is always very
nice<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:10.789> also<00:02:10.970> very<00:02:11.150> quiet<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
nice and it's also very quiet and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.430 
nice and it's also very quiet and
long<00:02:13.180> lasting<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.900> well<00:02:14.080> which<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.290> just

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
long lasting as well which is just

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100 
long lasting as well which is just
incredible<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.910> course<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.390> eighty-five

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
incredible of course it's eighty-five

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.720 
incredible of course it's eighty-five
compatible<00:02:17.709> which<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.010> great<00:02:18.340> considering

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
compatible which is great considering

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.449 
compatible which is great considering
the<00:02:19.060> high<00:02:19.239> flow<00:02:19.629> as<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.680> know<00:02:21.099> if<00:02:21.220> you've<00:02:21.340> ever

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
the high flow as you know if you've ever

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.860 
the high flow as you know if you've ever
done<00:02:21.610> an<00:02:21.849> e85<00:02:22.209> tune<00:02:22.920> 385<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.310> demands<00:02:24.879> a<00:02:25.000> ton

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
done an e85 tune 385 just demands a ton

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
done an e85 tune 385 just demands a ton
of<00:02:26.230> fuel<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.950> something<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.550> would

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
of fuel so something like this would

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.699 
of fuel so something like this would
work<00:02:28.000> perfect<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:29.200> course<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.530> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
work perfect and of course this is
