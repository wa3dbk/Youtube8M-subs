00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello to all i have today i'm going 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 show you how to properly clean his 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.330
 ipod touch 4th generation with very 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.580
 little material so first of all like 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 you can see my ipod at these 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 rooms so that's the back one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 the screen so for that you need everything 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.119
 just a little velvet rag 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 it is the best 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.590
 then demineralised water is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.920
 Very important 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 so it's very easy to walk around 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.280
 cloth you take rhythm must water 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 demineralized you put in the middle 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 like these have to be very 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 slightly wet it's very important 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 buffered a little bit like this so is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.079
 there you will first put me to 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.010
 the back so like this you do a 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.010
 circular motion 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:11.159
 this is all the more low or hunt as 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.250
 these on the side so here especially 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.700
 do not use a window washer or 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.159
 the alcohol 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 it's very important use water 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 demineralized it's perfect so that's it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.119
 for the back we finished once 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.119
 the back of the ipod clean we're going 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.400
 now go to the screen so that's 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 the same thing you're going to do 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.280
 circular motions always with 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:46.640
 your cloth slightly moistened as 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 this is as low from left to right 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 tac or hunt on the edges after you 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.810
 take a little walk on the edge here is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.840
 like that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 so this is normally your 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.450
 screen had to be slightly damp from 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.280
 the water will stay there again so that's 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.520
 very simple you wander your rag 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 or a side where it is dry and so you 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.870
 go do the same thing you go all 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 simply remove the back surface 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.080
 remaining like these tac 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.989
 here is so do not hesitate to do this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.629
 at least once a month or 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.840
 will see it's frankly it's magic 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 your screen is like new 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.099
 both the back and the taste there 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.530
 where you see who shines again 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.989
 it's really perfect so that's for 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.319
 this trick do not hesitate so arms the 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.590
 renew I really insist on that 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.590
 so here we go
