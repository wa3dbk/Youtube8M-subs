the<00:00:00.390> earth<00:00:00.570> spins<00:00:01.290> about<00:00:01.439> its<00:00:01.680> axis<00:00:01.920> at<00:00:02.310> about

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
the earth spins about its axis at about

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.720 
the earth spins about its axis at about
1675<00:00:04.470> km/h

what<00:00:06.240> would<00:00:06.420> happen<00:00:06.569> if<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.140> stopped<00:00:07.680> spinning

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
what would happen if it stopped spinning

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.440 
what would happen if it stopped spinning
this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.480> intrigue<00:00:09.960> ology<00:00:13.820> if<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.059> earth<00:00:15.210> were

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
this is intrigue ology if the earth were

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480 
this is intrigue ology if the earth were
to<00:00:15.480> suddenly<00:00:15.809> stop<00:00:16.230> spinning<00:00:16.590> everything<00:00:17.279> on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to suddenly stop spinning everything on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.099 
to suddenly stop spinning everything on
it<00:00:17.609> would<00:00:17.730> continue<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.359> spin<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> while

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it would continue to spin for a while

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.529 
it would continue to spin for a while
with<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> speed<00:00:20.039> relative<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.850> its<00:00:21.000> distance

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
with a speed relative to its distance

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.349 
with a speed relative to its distance
from<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> equator<00:00:22.730> things<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> equator

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
from the equator things that the equator

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.089 
from the equator things that the equator
would<00:00:24.570> spin<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> fastest<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.590> things<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
would spin the fastest and things that

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
would spin the fastest and things that
the<00:00:26.250> poles<00:00:26.519> would<00:00:26.880> perceive<00:00:27.240> almost<00:00:27.630> no<00:00:27.869> spin

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the poles would perceive almost no spin

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
the poles would perceive almost no spin
at<00:00:28.410> all<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:29.609> would<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.179> course<00:00:30.480> be

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
at all this would of course be

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.290 
at all this would of course be
catastrophic<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> many<00:00:32.520> organisms<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
catastrophic and many organisms and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
catastrophic and many organisms and
ecosystems<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.320> wiped<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.550> let's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ecosystems would be wiped out but let's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.180 
ecosystems would be wiped out but let's
assume<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.570> earth<00:00:36.719> spinning<00:00:37.380> gradually

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
assume that the earth spinning gradually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
assume that the earth spinning gradually
stopped<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:39.030> would<00:00:39.149> happen<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
stopped what would happen then for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
stopped what would happen then for
starters<00:00:40.829> each<00:00:41.190> day<00:00:41.430> would<00:00:41.640> take<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> year<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
starters each day would take a year to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
starters each day would take a year to
put<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.620> perspective<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.579> were<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
put it in perspective if you were to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
put it in perspective if you were to
look<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> Sun<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.739> take

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
look at the Sun right now it would take

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.670 
look at the Sun right now it would take
a<00:00:47.160> whole<00:00:47.640> year<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> return<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
a whole year for it to return to the

would<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.230> daytime<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.039> six<00:00:53.520> months<00:00:53.879> would<00:00:54.300> be

would be daytime and six months would be
nighttime<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.680> drastically<00:00:56.280> change

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
nighttime this would drastically change

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
nighttime this would drastically change
the<00:00:56.789> climates<00:00:57.270> during<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> daytime<00:00:58.649> months

Sun would become extremely hot and the
