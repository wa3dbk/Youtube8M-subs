00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.600 
should be an animatronic not a person or
person<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> suit<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.270> purple<00:02:07.049> man<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> out

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
person in the suit so purple man is out

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
person in the suit so purple man is out
the<00:02:08.610> snout<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.479> animatronic<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.470> brown

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the snout of this animatronic is brown

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.660 
the snout of this animatronic is brown
shade<00:02:11.220> unlike<00:02:12.000> foxes<00:02:12.510> or<00:02:12.720> chicas

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
shade unlike foxes or chicas

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.990 
shade unlike foxes or chicas
so<00:02:13.970> these<00:02:14.330> two<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.660> also<00:02:15.260> out<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.819> also

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
so these two are also out and I also

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.690 
so these two are also out and I also
noticed<00:02:17.480> something<00:02:17.870> else<00:02:18.110> there's<00:02:19.100> something

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
noticed something else there's something

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.840 
noticed something else there's something
on<00:02:19.850> top<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.690> animatronic<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.950> looks<00:02:22.640> like

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
on top of this animatronic it looks like

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.330 
on top of this animatronic it looks like
a<00:02:22.880> hat<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.569> think<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.440> could<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> small<00:02:25.069> top

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
a hat I think it could be the small top

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.390 
a hat I think it could be the small top
hat<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.760> Freddie<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.390> golden<00:02:26.720> freddie<00:02:26.990> has

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
hat that Freddie and golden freddie has

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.820 
hat that Freddie and golden freddie has
this<00:02:28.400> part<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> brim<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.569> Hat<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.560> rest

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
this part is a brim of the Hat the rest

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.490 
this part is a brim of the Hat the rest
of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> head<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.610> hidden<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.510> shadow<00:02:32.810> but

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
of the head is hidden in the shadow but

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.670 
of the head is hidden in the shadow but
we<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.800> see<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.190> more<00:02:34.490> reflection<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:36.110> my

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
we can see it's more reflection if my

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.310 
we can see it's more reflection if my
interpretation<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.790> correct<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.959> this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
interpretation is correct then this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.460 
interpretation is correct then this
animatronic<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.520> either<00:02:40.850> Freddy<00:02:41.300> or<00:02:41.810> golden

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
animatronic is either Freddy or golden

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.460 
animatronic is either Freddy or golden
Freddy<00:02:42.739> no<00:02:43.730> matter<00:02:43.940> which<00:02:44.209> one<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.569> is<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:45.050> think

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
Freddy no matter which one it is I think

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.560 
Freddy no matter which one it is I think
is<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.860> same<00:02:46.280> animatronic<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.360> last

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
is the same animatronic in the last

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.500 
is the same animatronic in the last
teaser<00:02:47.870> picture<00:02:48.410> as<00:02:48.620> color<00:02:49.430> matches<00:02:49.970> it's

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
teaser picture as color matches it's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.590 
teaser picture as color matches it's
broken<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.290> some<00:02:51.530> places<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.310> also<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
broken in some places and also the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.110 
broken in some places and also the
source<00:02:53.870> code<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.560> website<00:02:54.769> still<00:02:55.220> says<00:02:55.790> I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
source code of the website still says I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.500
