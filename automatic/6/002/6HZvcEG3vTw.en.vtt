00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello to all good bah happy new year to all 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.010
 for this first video on this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 tanganyka of 1600 liters 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.870
 it was about a month and a half 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.310
 that I had not done any video so 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:25.140
 the aquarium soon to be a year 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:30.510
 inch fish is undeniable on 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:37.130
 like that duboisy are more of 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.130
 all of the subadult juveniles now 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:48.660
 much more present the mixed he 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.600
 eel duboisy is really nice I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:59.059
 find it's going well for now 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.059
 but archi starts to settle 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 I really live and xenon are 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.740
 still there are the tunes and modus a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.740
 as well 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.030
 the other one is starting to dig 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 the patina and well present so that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.820
 see if I can zoom in 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:57.600
 works believe that low populations 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:02.970
 really patches in the rock is very 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.180
 visible with the video but they make their 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.180
 job 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.410
 so the corner of crypto that grows 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.400
 nicely I do not have too much nitrate to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.660
 true after one year 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.300
 so they may not have the nutrient 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.140
 that it needs the lighting always stays in 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.140
 70 watts 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.110
 So here is 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 because one year we fish 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:52.050
 see they follow an is how i eat 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.050
 now healthy 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 very pleasant 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.600
 really a fish to discover this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.600
 that are hesitant to launch 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.700
 with hindsight at the aquarium are still 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.730
 empty in quotation marks but me it's okay 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.360
 I'm waiting for them to be adults and a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.430
 not too loaded tray that's nice too 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.470
 the behavior of the fish is 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:52.430
 certainly different here so for 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.110
 this first video of the year in 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.340
 theory in a month to feline bajaur 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.340
 here is hi to all
