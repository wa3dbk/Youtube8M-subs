inconsistency some of these weapons are
insanely<00:00:24.239> good<00:00:24.719> while<00:00:24.960> others<00:00:25.320> leave<00:00:25.559> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
insanely good while others leave you

feeling<00:00:25.919> dirty<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.610> degraded<00:00:29.450> yeah<00:00:30.450> i<00:00:30.480> use

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
feeling dirty and degraded yeah i use

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
feeling dirty and degraded yeah i use
that<00:00:31.079> bit<00:00:31.320> before<00:00:31.680> but<00:00:31.950> it<00:00:32.070> never<00:00:32.099> gets<00:00:32.489> old

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that bit before but it never gets old

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.119

shotguns i don't know what the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.810 
shotguns i don't know what the
developers<00:00:37.170> were<00:00:37.289> thinking<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.039> know<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
developers were thinking I do know this

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
into modern warfare 3 the developers had

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
into modern warfare 3 the developers had
four<00:00:45.630> previous<00:00:46.380> games<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.040> look<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.370> for

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
four previous games to look at for

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
four previous games to look at for
guidance<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.540> should<00:00:48.810> have<00:00:48.899> been<00:00:48.989> easy<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
guidance it should have been easy to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
guidance it should have been easy to
balance<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:50.010> weapons<00:00:50.399> properly<00:00:50.970> and<00:00:51.180> give

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
balance these weapons properly and give

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.530 
balance these weapons properly and give
each<00:00:51.600> shotgun<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.200> role<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> mw3<00:00:53.540> unfortunately

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
each shotgun a role in mw3 unfortunately

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.840 
each shotgun a role in mw3 unfortunately
I<00:00:54.780> don't<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> happened<00:00:56.220> what<00:00:56.730> are

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I don't think that happened what are

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
I don't think that happened what are
these<00:00:56.970> roles<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.630> speak<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.200> may<00:00:58.380> ask<00:00:58.620> well

the<00:01:14.280> problem<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:14.999> shotguns<00:01:15.539> are<00:01:15.719> wildly

the problem the shotguns are wildly

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
the problem the shotguns are wildly
inconsistent<00:01:16.679> some<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.670> dominate<00:01:18.149> others

leave<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.959> wondering<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.649> even<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.069> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
leave you wondering if you even have a

characterizing<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.069> entire<00:01:23.490> tier<00:01:23.789> is<00:01:23.969> hard

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
characterizing the entire tier is hard

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
characterizing the entire tier is hard
so<00:01:24.569> I<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.779> to<00:01:24.929> break<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.259> shot<00:01:25.469> comes<00:01:25.709> down

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

takes 40 years just to get to the
promised<00:06:55.009> land<00:06:55.069> and<00:06:55.520> yes<00:06:55.879> I<00:06:56.180> did<00:06:56.300> just<00:06:56.810> compare

promised land and yes I did just compare

the<00:06:57.319> shotguns<00:06:57.770> in<00:06:57.919> modern<00:06:58.219> warfare<00:06:58.400> 3<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:59.060> the

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
the shotguns in modern warfare 3 to the

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.700 
the shotguns in modern warfare 3 to the
liberation<00:06:59.569> of<00:06:59.810> the<00:06:59.900> Jewish<00:07:00.169> people<00:07:00.560> from

liberation of the Jewish people from

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.070 
liberation of the Jewish people from
Egypt<00:07:00.830> I<00:07:01.340> can't<00:07:02.060> think<00:07:02.270> of<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.419> good<00:07:02.629> segue<00:07:03.020> from

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
Egypt I can't think of a good segue from

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.839 
Egypt I can't think of a good segue from
that<00:07:03.409> so<00:07:03.710> we're<00:07:04.039> going<00:07:04.219> to<00:07:04.400> the<00:07:04.490> breaking

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
that so we're going to the breaking

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.790 
that so we're going to the breaking
point<00:07:05.060> in<00:07:05.210> this<00:07:05.360> video<00:07:05.659> admittedly<00:07:06.529> the

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
point in this video admittedly the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.499 
point in this video admittedly the
shotguns<00:07:07.249> are<00:07:07.400> a<00:07:07.430> big<00:07:07.699> subject<00:07:07.999> so<00:07:08.389> I've

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
shotguns are a big subject so I've

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.239 
shotguns are a big subject so I've
decided<00:07:08.689> to<00:07:09.020> split<00:07:09.319> this<00:07:09.469> video<00:07:09.800> in<00:07:10.009> the<00:07:10.099> two

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:10.249 
decided to split this video in the two

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:12.309 
decided to split this video in the two
