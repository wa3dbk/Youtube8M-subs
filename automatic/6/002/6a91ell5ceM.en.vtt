00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to the front so that you can then pull

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.959 
to the front so that you can then pull
it<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:47.550> into<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> perfect<00:00:48.420> position<00:00:49.969> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it down into the perfect position this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
it down into the perfect position this
alkyne<00:00:51.360> 3c<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.739> case<00:00:53.010> you're<00:00:53.250> using<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
alkyne 3c is also in case you're using a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
alkyne 3c is also in case you're using a
fur<00:00:53.879> blanket<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.649> very

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
fur blanket like we see here it is very

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
fur blanket like we see here it is very
important<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> fur<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.360> bending

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
important that the fur is not bending

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
important that the fur is not bending
underneath<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> saddle<00:00:58.590> blanket<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
underneath the saddle blanket so that

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.520 
underneath the saddle blanket so that
wrapping<00:01:00.059> spots<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> bruises<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> horses

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
wrapping spots and bruises on the horses

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
wrapping spots and bruises on the horses
back<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.100> avoided<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.390> second<00:01:03.870> area<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
back can be avoided the second area that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
back can be avoided the second area that
hooks<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> account<00:01:06.860> when<00:01:07.860> pulling<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> saddle

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
hooks to account when pulling the saddle

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
hooks to account when pulling the saddle
into<00:01:09.180> place<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.170> notice<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
into place you will notice that it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
into place you will notice that it
actually<00:01:11.189> finds<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.880> fitting<00:01:12.299> spot<00:01:12.420> on

past<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.560> important<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
past it is also important that we have a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
past it is also important that we have a
little<00:01:23.759> air<00:01:23.909> pocket<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
little air pocket right here so that the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
little air pocket right here so that the

pressure<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> withers<00:01:30.829> therefore<00:01:31.829> always

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
pressure on the withers therefore always

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010 
pressure on the withers therefore always
lift<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> saddle<00:01:33.210> after<00:01:33.570> finding<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
lift up the saddle after finding the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
lift up the saddle after finding the
fitting<00:01:34.290> spot<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.799> create<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.670> hole<00:01:35.970> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the saddle channel you come out diluting

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.190 
the saddle channel you come out diluting
so<00:01:39.890> don't<00:01:40.310> shy<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:40.820> all<00:01:41.180> right<00:01:41.390> now<00:01:41.930> let's

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
so don't shy of that all right now let's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.630 
so don't shy of that all right now let's
take<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.410> look<00:01:42.680> at<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.950> other<00:01:43.100> side<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
take a look at the other side of the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.930 
take a look at the other side of the
horse<00:01:43.850> looks<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.020> saddle<00:01:45.410> fits<00:01:45.620> well

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
horse looks like the saddle fits well

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.700 
horse looks like the saddle fits well
then<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:47.420> clean<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.810> girth<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.350> make<00:01:48.530> sure

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
then we can clean the girth to make sure

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.440 
then we can clean the girth to make sure
that<00:01:49.010> there<00:01:49.160> is<00:01:49.250> no<00:01:49.430> sand<00:01:49.760> or<00:01:49.910> dirt<00:01:50.090> underneath

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that there is no sand or dirt underneath

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.170 
that there is no sand or dirt underneath

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.210 

so<00:01:56.180> when<00:01:56.420> it's<00:01:56.570> an<00:01:56.690> anchored<00:01:57.050> suma<00:01:57.470> hat<00:01:57.710> when

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220

so when it's an anchored suma hat when
closing<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.700> girth<00:01:58.940> make<00:01:59.570> sure<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.170> are

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
closing the girth make sure that you are

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.440 
closing the girth make sure that you are
not<00:02:00.410> closing<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.950> too<00:02:01.100> tight<00:02:01.370> because<00:02:01.820> horses

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
not closing it too tight because horses

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.610 
not closing it too tight because horses
