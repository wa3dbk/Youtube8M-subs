to<00:02:09.850> try<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> get<00:02:10.240> through<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.899> first<00:02:11.050> half<00:02:11.350> of

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
to try to get through the first half of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.260 
to try to get through the first half of
this<00:02:11.590> real<00:02:11.860> quick<00:02:12.130> we're<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.850> highlight

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
this real quick we're going to highlight

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.370 
this real quick we're going to highlight
all<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.720> these<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:15.630> we're<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> set<00:02:17.290> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
all of these and we're going to set it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.910 
all of these and we're going to set it
to<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> same<00:02:17.860> event<00:02:18.400> type<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.390> MIDI<00:02:19.900> CC<00:02:20.440> I'm

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to the same event type just MIDI CC I'm

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.460 
to the same event type just MIDI CC I'm
assuming<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:22.050> continuous<00:02:23.050> control

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
assuming that that is continuous control

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.100 
assuming that that is continuous control
constant<00:02:24.070> control<00:02:24.430> Chinese<00:02:25.209> check<00:02:25.570> whatever

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
constant control Chinese check whatever

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
constant control Chinese check whatever
now<00:02:29.110> these<00:02:29.380> values<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
now these values this is going to be the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850 
now these values this is going to be the
most<00:02:31.000> tedious<00:02:31.270> part<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:32.050> setting<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.620> up

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
most tedious part of setting this up

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.160 
most tedious part of setting this up
you're<00:02:33.580> going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> need<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.180> set<00:02:34.630> these<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
you're going to need to set these to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.830 
you're going to need to set these to
each<00:02:35.530> individual<00:02:36.370> number<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.570> right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
each individual number and as of right

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.780 
each individual number and as of right
now<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.080> have<00:02:38.470> not<00:02:38.590> found<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:39.010> quicker<00:02:39.220> name<00:02:39.489> a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
now I have not found a quicker name a

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.320 
now I have not found a quicker name a
quicker<00:02:40.180> way<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:43.000> I'm<00:02:43.300> just

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
quicker way to do that and so I'm just

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.910 
quicker way to do that and so I'm just
going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.600> fast-forward<00:02:43.989> through<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.590> part

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
going to fast-forward through this part

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 
going to fast-forward through this part
well<00:02:45.880> basically<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.330> you're<00:02:46.450> trying<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.690> do

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
well basically what you're trying to do

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.320 
well basically what you're trying to do
just<00:02:47.170> assign<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> bit<00:02:48.100> individual<00:02:48.790> number<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
just assign a bit individual number to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.690 
just assign a bit individual number to
each<00:02:49.480> individual<00:02:50.260> function<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.220> fail<00:02:51.520> to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
each individual function if you fail to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.850 
each individual function if you fail to
do<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.850> say<00:02:52.300> for<00:02:52.360> example<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.590> two

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
do that say for example just have two

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.360 
do that say for example just have two
zeros<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:56.140> know<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:57.190> two

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
zeros for you know for this for two

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.100 
zeros for you know for this for two
different<00:02:57.550> functions<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:58.840> you're<00:03:00.930> triage<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
different functions if you're triage it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.070 
different functions if you're triage it
may<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.590> channel<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.080> designated

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
may be channel one and you designated

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.770 
may be channel one and you designated
that<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.680> cross<00:03:06.220> fader<00:03:06.459> one<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.850> two<00:03:07.000> that

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
that for cross fader one and two that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.600 
that for cross fader one and two that
cross<00:03:08.080> fader<00:03:08.350> one<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.280> your<00:03:09.430> touch

cross fader one on to on to your touch
osc<00:03:10.090> s<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.540> manipulate<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.320> cross

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
osc s and just manipulate the cross

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.470 
osc s and just manipulate the cross

or<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.379> that<00:03:29.409> one<00:03:29.829> ping<00:03:30.219> name<00:03:30.849> there<00:03:31.090> doesn't

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
or in that one ping name there doesn't

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.099 
or in that one ping name there doesn't
need<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> be<00:03:31.659> excited<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> value<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:32.859> just<00:03:32.950> uh

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
need to be excited of value it's just uh

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
to go to your DJing program in this case

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.940 
to go to your DJing program in this case
we<00:04:07.599> used<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.870> write<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.049> scratch<00:04:08.290> live<00:04:10.950> gonna

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
we used to write a scratch live gonna

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.670 
we used to write a scratch live gonna
click<00:04:12.159> on<00:04:12.280> MIDI<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:14.169> now<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.290> can<00:04:14.439> see<00:04:14.590> your

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
click on MIDI and now you can see your

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.400 
click on MIDI and now you can see your
cursor<00:04:14.950> has<00:04:15.340> turned<00:04:15.579> into<00:04:15.700> an<00:04:15.849> indicator<00:04:16.269> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
cursor has turned into an indicator to
