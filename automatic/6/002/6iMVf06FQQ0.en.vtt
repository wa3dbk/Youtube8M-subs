00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the finishing block what I'm going to do

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.470 
the finishing block what I'm going to do
now<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:27.110> join<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.950> temple<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.150> created

now is join a temple that I created

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.690 
now is join a temple that I created
earlier<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:31.490> you're

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
earlier so that you can see what you're

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.820 
earlier so that you can see what you're
actually<00:02:31.910> doing<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.230> plug-in<00:02:33.620> as

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
actually doing with the plug-in as

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.270 
actually doing with the plug-in as
opposed<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.490> just<00:02:34.520> creating<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.540> line

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
opposed to just creating like a line

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.660 
opposed to just creating like a line
which<00:02:37.280> isn't<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.180> interesting<00:02:39.670> what's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
which isn't very interesting what's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.510 
which isn't very interesting what's
really<00:02:40.880> cool<00:02:41.180> about<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.520> when

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
really cool about this is that when

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.350 
really cool about this is that when
you're<00:02:43.700> done<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:45.740> whole<00:02:46.130> temple<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.910> restored

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
you're done the whole temple is restored

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.980 
you're done the whole temple is restored
in<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.780> file<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> what<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.270> can<00:02:50.420> do<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.959> just

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
in a file so what you can do is just

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.810 
in a file so what you can do is just
share<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:51.830> other<00:02:51.980> people<00:02:52.070> really<00:02:52.640> easily

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
share it with other people really easily

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.180 
share it with other people really easily

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
you just drag and drop the file into

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.610 
you just drag and drop the file into
your<00:02:55.310> saved<00:02:55.640> temples<00:02:56.209> file<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:56.959> created

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
your saved temples file that is created

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.550 
your saved temples file that is created
in<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.830> configs<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.580> then<00:02:59.330> other<00:02:59.780> people<00:03:00.170> on

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
in the configs and then other people on

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.860 
in the configs and then other people on
different<00:03:00.800> servers<00:03:01.100> can<00:03:01.400> play<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.730> too<00:03:01.940> so

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
different servers can play it too so

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.660 
different servers can play it too so
what<00:03:03.020> I'm<00:03:03.110> gonna<00:03:03.230> make<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.550> uh<00:03:06.670> I'm

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
what I'm gonna make it do is uh I'm

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.970 
what I'm gonna make it do is uh I'm
gonna<00:03:08.270> allow<00:03:08.720> people<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.140> upload<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.860> my

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
gonna allow people to upload it to my

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.600 
gonna allow people to upload it to my
website<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:11.750> download<00:03:12.260> other<00:03:12.610> temples

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
website and then download other temples

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.290 
website and then download other temples
so<00:03:13.910> then<00:03:14.060> it'll<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:14.840> much<00:03:15.050> easier<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:17.150> what

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
so then it'll be much easier to see what

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.449 
so then it'll be much easier to see what
other<00:03:17.450> people<00:03:17.720> have<00:03:17.810> created<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.380> play<00:03:19.070> and

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
other people have created and play and

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:30.550 
other people have created and play and
create<00:03:20.180> etc<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.910> plugin<00:03:29.180> still<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.810> kind

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
create etc so this plugin still is kind
