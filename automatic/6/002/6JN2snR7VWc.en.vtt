but<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.690> was<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.140> good<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.560> as<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:42.370> can

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.060 
but it was really good and as you can
see<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:43.060> gone<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.840> must<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.260> been

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
see it's gone so it must have been

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
my initial thing was I wanted to do a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.570 
my initial thing was I wanted to do a
twist<00:02:57.580> out<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:58.150> bandit<00:02:58.720> twist<00:02:59.020> out<00:02:59.260> but<00:03:00.220> by

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
twist out a bandit twist out but by

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.280 
twist out a bandit twist out but by
being<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.120> late<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.660> little<00:03:01.900> bit<00:03:02.020> after

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
being so late it's a little bit after

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.160 
being so late it's a little bit after
eight<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.739> eastern<00:03:03.100> standard<00:03:03.370> time<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:05.020> I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
eight here eastern standard time and I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.930 
eight here eastern standard time and I
get<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.530> approximately<00:03:05.860> around<00:03:06.580> five<00:03:06.910> thirty
