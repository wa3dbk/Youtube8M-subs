00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
2 k's plays are you guys seeing maybe

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.729 
2 k's plays are you guys seeing maybe
something<00:03:39.510> being<00:03:39.900> able<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.230> shuffle<00:03:40.440> there

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
something being able to shuffle there

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.620 
something being able to shuffle there
from<00:03:40.980> other<00:03:41.130> teams<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.549> mean<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.390> we<00:03:42.510> do

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
from other teams I mean I think we do

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.509 
from other teams I mean I think we do
see<00:03:42.840> some<00:03:43.170> weakness<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.830> early<00:03:44.040> game<00:03:44.190> for

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
see some weakness in the early game for

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.100 
see some weakness in the early game for
UK<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.030> they're<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> lane<00:03:45.750> swaps

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
UK when they're not in the lane swaps

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.840 
UK when they're not in the lane swaps
for<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.530> longer<00:03:46.830> period<00:03:47.100> or<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.519> they<00:03:47.700> don't

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
for a longer period or if they don't

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.400 
for a longer period or if they don't
manage<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.269> goal<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.230> lane

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
manage to get the goal it in that lane

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.930 
manage to get the goal it in that lane
swap<00:03:49.620> itself<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.190> there's<00:03:50.370> definitely<00:03:50.519> things

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
swap itself so there's definitely things

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.690 
swap itself so there's definitely things
to<00:03:51.180> work<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.630> for<00:03:51.900> them<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.370> thing<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.400> they

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
to work on for them but thing is they

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.870 
to work on for them but thing is they
are<00:03:54.080> currently<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.500> far<00:03:55.830> ahead<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.280> at<00:03:56.700> least

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
are currently so far ahead of at least

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.759 
are currently so far ahead of at least
their<00:03:57.239> seven<00:03:57.750> other<00:03:57.900> teams<00:03:58.019> we<00:03:58.380> can<00:03:58.410> say<00:03:58.739> that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
their seven other teams we can say that

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.949 
their seven other teams we can say that
almost<00:03:59.160> securing<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.670> playoff<00:04:00.060> spot<00:04:00.360> that

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
almost securing that playoff spot that

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.270 
almost securing that playoff spot that
they<00:04:01.080> can<00:04:01.350> afford<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> lose<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> few<00:04:02.220> games

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
they can afford to lose a few games

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.340 
they can afford to lose a few games
figure<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.150> if<00:04:03.239> some<00:04:03.510> some<00:04:03.810> mistakes<00:04:04.140> maybe

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
figure out if some some mistakes maybe

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.199 
figure out if some some mistakes maybe
and<00:04:04.620> then<00:04:04.680> fix<00:04:04.950> them<00:04:05.100> before<00:04:05.190> playoffs<00:04:05.580> that's

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
and then fix them before playoffs that's

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.949 
and then fix them before playoffs that's
what<00:04:06.330> they're<00:04:06.420> looking<00:04:06.660> towards<00:04:06.840> but

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
what they're looking towards but

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.120 
what they're looking towards but
obviously<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> want<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.440> secure<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.769> top<00:04:07.920> two

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
obviously you want to secure the top two

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.020 
obviously you want to secure the top two
you<00:04:08.280> want<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.580> straight<00:04:08.849> into<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
you want to get straight into the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.940 
you want to get straight into the
semifinals<00:04:09.780> as<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.990> higher<00:04:10.200> chance<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.680> going

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
semifinals as a higher chance of going

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.070 
semifinals as a higher chance of going
to<00:04:11.099> worlds<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.430> well<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.000> maybe<00:04:12.240> h2k<00:04:12.990> an

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
to worlds as well and maybe h2k an

to worlds as well and maybe h2k an
phonetic<00:04:13.470> you're<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.740> learning<00:04:13.860> how<00:04:14.040> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
phonetic you're just learning how to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.600 
phonetic you're just learning how to
play<00:04:14.340> from

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
play from

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.400 
play from
behind<00:04:14.850> we<00:04:15.000> saw<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.049> almost<00:04:16.230> too<00:04:16.380> easy

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
behind we saw like it's almost too easy

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.020 
behind we saw like it's almost too easy
when<00:04:16.829> they<00:04:16.859> win<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.220> early<00:04:17.400> game<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.730> they<00:04:17.850> set

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
when they win the early game so they set

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.280 
when they win the early game so they set
themselves<00:04:18.209> behind<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.720> little<00:04:18.840> bit<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.230> I

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
themselves behind a little bit and I

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
themselves behind a little bit and I
said<00:04:19.440> not<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:19.739> let's<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.250> how<00:04:20.340> far<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:20.640> can<00:04:20.670> go

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
said not out let's see how far we can go

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.460 
said not out let's see how far we can go
before<00:04:21.329> we<00:04:21.420> actually<00:04:21.450> get<00:04:21.810> close<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.200> losing<00:04:22.380> a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
before we actually get close to losing a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.040 
before we actually get close to losing a
game<00:04:22.680> perhaps<00:04:23.370> educated<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.000> same<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.450> doubt

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
game perhaps educated the same I doubt

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.990 
game perhaps educated the same I doubt
it<00:04:25.080> but<00:04:25.620> yeah<00:04:25.800> there<00:04:26.010> they've<00:04:26.610> shown<00:04:26.820> some

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
it but yeah there they've shown some

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.640 
it but yeah there they've shown some
cracks<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:27.450> honestly<00:04:27.750> they've<00:04:28.350> also<00:04:28.500> shown

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
cracks but honestly they've also shown

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.370 
cracks but honestly they've also shown
great<00:04:29.310> growth<00:04:29.580> over<00:04:30.270> time<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.690> I'm<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.230> no

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
great growth over time so I'm I have no

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.720 
great growth over time so I'm I have no
doubts<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.770> prolly<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.340> team<00:04:32.520> will

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
doubts that prolly and the team will

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.180 
doubts that prolly and the team will
likely<00:04:33.300> pick<00:04:34.050> up<00:04:34.140> that<00:04:34.260> slack<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.770> hopefully

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
likely pick up that slack and hopefully

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.160 
likely pick up that slack and hopefully
fix<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.550> for<00:04:35.730> next<00:04:35.820> week<00:04:36.060> definitely<00:04:36.660> finally

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
Giants aren't that much better than the
