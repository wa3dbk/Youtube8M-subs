also<00:00:07.630> you<00:00:07.690> have<00:00:07.960> four<00:00:08.830> fingers<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.570> have

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
also you have four fingers and you have

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.270 
also you have four fingers and you have
six<00:00:10.930> strings<00:00:11.290> so<00:00:11.559> now<00:00:11.680> you<00:00:11.740> can<00:00:11.920> do<00:00:12.070> different

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
six strings so now you can do different

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.430 
six strings so now you can do different
kind<00:00:12.550> of<00:00:12.610> combinations<00:00:13.210> there<00:00:13.600> so<00:00:14.200> you<00:00:14.260> could

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
kind of combinations there so you could

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.630 
kind of combinations there so you could
do<00:00:14.620> one<00:00:15.100> two<00:00:15.459> three<00:00:15.820> four<00:00:16.209> like<00:00:16.960> this<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:18.490> you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
do one two three four like this or you

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.090 
do one two three four like this or you
can<00:00:18.820> use<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:19.390> sixth<00:00:20.080> string<00:00:20.140> in<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.710> fifth

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
can use the sixth string in the fifth

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.460 
can use the sixth string in the fifth
string<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:21.670> do<00:00:22.090> the<00:00:22.210> same<00:00:22.390> combination<00:00:22.750> but

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
string and do the same combination but

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.640 
string and do the same combination but
this<00:00:23.680> time<00:00:23.890> you<00:00:24.040> would<00:00:24.130> play<00:00:24.400> one<00:00:25.180> two<00:00:25.930> three

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
this time you would play one two three

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.580 
this time you would play one two three
four<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.420> what<00:00:28.540> I'm<00:00:28.630> doing<00:00:28.840> now<00:00:28.870> isn't<00:00:29.200> taking

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
four so what I'm doing now isn't taking

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.770 
four so what I'm doing now isn't taking
the<00:00:29.650> second<00:00:30.100> and<00:00:30.280> figure<00:00:31.060> my<00:00:31.090> fourth<00:00:31.570> finger

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
the second and figure my fourth finger

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.170 
the second and figure my fourth finger
and<00:00:32.140> playing<00:00:32.619> those<00:00:32.800> notes<00:00:33.070> on<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> next

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
and playing those notes on the next

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:44.880 
and playing those notes on the next
adjacent<00:00:34.450> string<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:44.200> that's<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.680> great

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
adjacent string and that's a great

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:53.600 
adjacent string and that's a great
exercise<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.270> also<00:00:52.420> for<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.840> right<00:00:53.050> hand<00:00:53.320> too

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
exercise but also for the right hand too

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.790 
exercise but also for the right hand too
I'm<00:00:54.610> still<00:00:54.970> using<00:00:55.120> alternate<00:00:55.600> picking<00:00:58.800> but

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
I'm still using alternate picking but

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.139 
I'm still using alternate picking but
i'll<00:00:59.890> show<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.160> something<00:01:00.489> else<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.030> we're

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
i'll show you something else so we're

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.790 
i'll show you something else so we're
talking<00:01:01.390> more<00:01:01.750> about<00:01:01.870> these<00:01:02.079> techniques<00:01:02.530> to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
talking more about these techniques to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.090 
talking more about these techniques to
in<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.360> exercise<00:01:04.360> section<00:01:04.989> because<00:01:05.530> i<00:01:05.740> use

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
in this exercise section because i use

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.670 
in this exercise section because i use
the<00:01:06.460> nails<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.909> my<00:01:07.090> second<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.079> third<00:01:08.140> finger

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
the nails of my second and third finger

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.639 
the nails of my second and third finger
for<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.920> lot<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.189> chicken<00:01:09.520> pickin

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.219 

kind<00:01:14.649> of<00:01:14.740> stuff<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:16.210> technique<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.719> we're

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
kind of stuff one technique that we're

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.599 
kind of stuff one technique that we're
going<00:01:17.319> to<00:01:17.409> talk<00:01:17.590> about<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.890> lot<00:01:18.069> is<00:01:18.280> going<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.460> be

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
going to talk about a lot is going to be

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:26.190 
going to talk about a lot is going to be
the<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:18.880> pick<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.569> 2nd<00:01:19.960> finger<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:26.170> know

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
the you pick in the 2nd finger you know

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.989 
the you pick in the 2nd finger you know
this<00:01:26.560> way<00:01:26.770> what's<00:01:27.069> going<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.429> is<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.700> pic<00:01:27.880> of

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
this way what's going on is the pic of

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.459 
this way what's going on is the pic of
the<00:01:28.030> second<00:01:28.420> finger<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.780> pic<00:01:28.959> now<00:01:29.140> becomes

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
the second finger the pic now becomes

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.730 
the second finger the pic now becomes
more<00:01:29.709> like<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.459> down<00:01:30.670> stroke<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:32.200> second

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
more like the down stroke and the second

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.520 
more like the down stroke and the second
finger<00:01:32.950> becomes<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.340> upstroke<00:01:37.289> so<00:01:38.289> in<00:01:38.409> this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
finger becomes the upstroke so in this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.289 
finger becomes the upstroke so in this
exercise<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.369> we're<00:01:39.520> doing<00:01:39.640> now<00:01:39.939> which<00:01:40.270> is

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
exercise that we're doing now which is

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.359 
exercise that we're doing now which is
one<00:01:40.599> two<00:01:40.840> three<00:01:41.229> four<00:01:41.500> on<00:01:41.859> two<00:01:42.099> adjacent

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
one two three four on two adjacent

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.520 
one two three four on two adjacent
strings<00:01:42.880> another<00:01:43.780> way<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:43.959> do<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.319> is<00:01:44.500> to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
strings another way to do it is to

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.410 
strings another way to do it is to
you're<00:01:45.429> already<00:01:45.579> doing<00:01:45.729> with<00:01:46.000> alternate

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
you're already doing with alternate

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.059 
you're already doing with alternate
picking<00:01:46.569> which<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.989> down<00:01:52.679> another<00:01:53.679> way<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.860> do

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
picking which is down another way to do

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.740 
picking which is down another way to do
it<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> practice<00:01:54.579> going<00:01:55.090> down<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.719> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
it is to practice going down with the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.999 
it is to practice going down with the
pic<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.099> second<00:01:57.670> finger<00:01:58.000> down<00:01:58.479> okay<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
pic of the second finger down okay of

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.630 
pic of the second finger down okay of
the<00:02:00.280> second<00:02:00.640> finger

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.590 

so<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.790> kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.299> jig<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
so that's kind of like a little jig a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:19.370 
so that's kind of like a little jig a
pic<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.020> time<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.810> thinking<00:02:18.989> about<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
pic in time so be thinking about that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.470 
pic in time so be thinking about that
right<00:02:19.560> hand<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> soon<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.880> you're<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.390> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
right hand to you soon if you're if you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.809 
right hand to you soon if you're if you
start<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> cross<00:02:22.170> strings<00:02:22.670> what<00:02:23.670> we're

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
start going to cross strings what we're

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.910 
start going to cross strings what we're
talking<00:02:24.090> about<00:02:24.150> now<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> different

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
talking about now do a different

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.110 
talking about now do a different
fingerings<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.670> might<00:02:26.819> want<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> try

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
fingerings there you might want to try

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.820 
fingerings there you might want to try
incorporating<00:02:27.510> your<00:02:28.440> second<00:02:29.100> third<00:02:29.310> finger

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.530 

because<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.950> will<00:02:35.130> encounter<00:02:36.000> some<00:02:36.330> stuff

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
because you will encounter some stuff

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:51.080 
because you will encounter some stuff
like<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:48.739> cross<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.950> stream<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.580> keep<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
like that cross the stream so keep that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.020 
like that cross the stream so keep that
in<00:02:51.269> mind

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.740 

we're<00:02:58.030> going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.210> come<00:02:58.330> back<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.600> some

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
we're going to come back to some

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.030 
we're going to come back to some
exercises<00:02:59.230> for<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.410> right<00:02:59.560> hand<00:02:59.800> for<00:02:59.950> those

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
exercises for the right hand for those

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.580 
exercises for the right hand for those
fingers<00:03:00.400> too<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.630> back<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> what<00:03:02.440> we're

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
fingers too so back to what we're

kind of complex than that and you can do

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.349 
kind of complex than that and you can do
the<00:05:34.049> reverse<00:05:34.349> get<00:05:35.009> into<00:05:35.249> some<00:05:35.459> another<00:05:35.729> finger

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:36.359 
the reverse get into some another finger

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:41.389 
the reverse get into some another finger
indices<00:05:37.789> yeah<00:05:38.789> that's<00:05:39.119> like<00:05:39.329> four<00:05:40.099> three<00:05:41.099> on

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
indices yeah that's like four three on
