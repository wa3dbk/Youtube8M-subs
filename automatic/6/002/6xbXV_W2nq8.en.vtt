00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.740
 we have seen in the speeches 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.620
 previous what is cholesterol how many 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 types exist there are the sources and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.099
 how we can control them and we have 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.650
 introduced the Mediterranean diet 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.670
 as a means to achieve this 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 target 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.980
 but what is the Mediterranean diet 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 it is not a specific diet program 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 a nutritional model then a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.539
 set of habits and behaviors 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.929
 foods that characterize the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.879
 populations of the Mediterranean basin 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:37.859
 unfortunately in the last twenty years it is 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.370
 Mediterranean food has been 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.659
 set aside to leave space 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.209
 to the food coming from 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.850
 united states deemed more attractive 

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:50.459
 because unfortunately I said why 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.949
 the Mediterranean diet has 

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:56.429
 shown to have a correlation 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.579
 positive with life span 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.059
 the Italian population in fact has the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.549
 longest average life span of all 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.969
 other European peoples with 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.289
 a life expectancy of about 78 years 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.159
 and half for men is about 84 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.820
 years for women 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.490
 based on the latest istat data but 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.259
 what characterizes the power supply 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.649
 Mediterranean high consumption of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.859
 extra virgin olive oil fish cereals 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.950
 olive fruit and vegetables and why not 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:35.219
 also a glass of red wine a lot 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.159
 rich in antioxidants and antioxidants 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.100
 mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids have 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 indeed proven to reduce risk 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.049
 of cardiovascular disorders e 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.240
 degenerative but there are some 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.399
 situations in life like 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.429
 the growth rather than the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.670
 senescence situations of periods of 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.649
 emotional stress during pregnancy or moments 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.740
 in which we practice with particular 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.229
 intensity physical activity in which also 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.579
 Mediterranean food may not 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.250
 to be able to make 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.099
 to the body what it needs 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.069
 and it is these situations in which one does 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.950
 suggests of 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.079
 rush to integration especially of 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.439
 vitamins and mineral salts 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.810
 There is in fact for these nutrients a 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.090
 recommended daily dose 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.930
 just to avoid the onset of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 disorders but we find the daily dose 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.780
 recommended on the packaging of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.319
 supplements such as rda from the acronym 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.109
 English but the rda must be able to interpret 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.840
 because why if I find that with mine 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.750
 supplement I am already taking 100 for 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.879
 hundred of the rda this does not mean that 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.049
 I can not assume through 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.569
 alimony 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.919
 that same micronutrient in the field 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.260
 of the day 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.980
 I give a classic example of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.969
 C vitamin 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.480
 the vitamin c rda is 60 mg per 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.299
 day 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.669
 the quantity contained in an orange 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.219
 remedies dimensions since for each 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.980
 micronutrients also exist a level 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:13.900
 superior to not exceed that of 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.439
 Vitamin C is 1,000 milligrams per 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.139
 day 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.840
 this means that if I supplement 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.680
 contains 60 mg of vitamin c 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.169
 I still have around 18 19 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.810
 orange from can fade in the ambit of 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.509
 day but integration does not have to 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.699
 becoming a habit must be 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:36.400
 limited and limited to a period 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.979
 the right to control those disorders 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.979
 whose onset is an index of 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:45.370
 incorrect or unbalanced feeding 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.419
 however inadequate we have seen in 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.259
 this video 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.269
 what is the Mediterranean diet e 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:55.599
 we also saw that it was made by 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.389
 part but recently has been re-evaluated 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.949
 proof is that it has been revised 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.349
 food pyramid that you always have 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:05.489
 characterized and which we will describe 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.489
 in the next intervention
