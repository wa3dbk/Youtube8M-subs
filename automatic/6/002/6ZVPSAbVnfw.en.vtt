four years ago when I decided to move to
do<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.410> Alice<00:00:25.410> let's<00:00:25.890> say<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.279> found<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
do that Alice let's say that I found a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.540 
do that Alice let's say that I found a
very<00:00:27.029> open<00:00:27.510> culture<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.470> open<00:00:28.980> environment

of the faculty I engaged pretty much
with<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> variety<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> education

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
with a variety of the of the education

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
with a variety of the of the education
so<00:00:38.550> students<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.450> build<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.989> his<00:00:40.320> own

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
so students can really build up his own

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.930 

architectural<00:01:15.840> engineering<00:01:16.230> is<00:01:16.530> very

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
architectural engineering is very

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.790 
architectural engineering is very
positive<00:01:17.940> intention<00:01:18.480> this<00:01:18.690> dichotomy<00:01:19.620> these

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
positive intention this dichotomy these

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.540 
positive intention this dichotomy these
types<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.660> abstract<00:01:21.950> ism<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.160> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> same

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
types of abstract ism but at the same

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.180 
types of abstract ism but at the same
time<00:01:23.760> is<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.090> pragmatism<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.010> what

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
time is very pragmatism in it so what

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.400 
time is very pragmatism in it so what
they<00:01:26.310> call<00:01:26.550> this<00:01:26.700> technical<00:01:27.270> poetry<00:01:27.780> might<00:01:28.230> be

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
they call this technical poetry might be

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.840 
they call this technical poetry might be
I<00:01:28.440> my<00:01:28.620> project<00:01:28.980> is<00:01:29.010> called<00:01:29.070> La<00:01:29.370> Casa<00:01:29.520> Tabora

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I my project is called La Casa Tabora

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.070 
I my project is called La Casa Tabora
and<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.510> basically<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:32.360> Marine<00:01:33.360> Research

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
and is basically a Marine Research

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.850 
and is basically a Marine Research
Center<00:01:34.620> in<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.890> touch<00:01:35.870> seaside<00:01:36.870> costs<00:01:37.200> keep

Center in the touch seaside costs keep

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
Center in the touch seaside costs keep
on<00:01:38.040> dreaming<00:01:38.490> keep<00:01:38.730> on<00:01:38.880> being<00:01:39.180> open<00:01:39.540> because
