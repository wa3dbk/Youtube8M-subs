00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.130
 Hello everyone today, the 8th number I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.349
 I went to jump a little bit away than I am 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.139
 I usually go on a couple more years 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 jump means hang 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 which will soon appear store 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.770
 we have a week somewhere else for those 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.620
 anyone have any questions if you video us 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:28.150
 I will expose a reflex camera nikon d500 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.390
 don't interfere 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 farther 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.560
 buy water very 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 I'll go and tell you some water 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.650
 and then it will be possible to go further in 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.650
 the fact that without water is very tough 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 but 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 but 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.350
 Yes 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.930

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.950
