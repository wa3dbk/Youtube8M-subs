the<00:00:03.689> flooville<00:00:04.339> aqua<00:00:05.339> clear<00:00:05.870> power<00:00:06.870> filter<00:00:07.760> it

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the flooville aqua clear power filter it

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.959 
the flooville aqua clear power filter it
was<00:00:08.910> formerly<00:00:09.599> known<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.900> aqua<00:00:10.590> clear<00:00:10.759> 200<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
was formerly known as aqua clear 200 and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.600 
was formerly known as aqua clear 200 and
then<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.809> changed<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.830> aqua<00:00:14.460> clear

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
then they changed it to the aqua clear

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.529 
then they changed it to the aqua clear
50<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.480> now<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> their<00:00:16.920> third<00:00:17.539> name

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
50 and now this is their third name

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you know they change it outside of the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.830 
you know they change it outside of the
box<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> flooville<00:00:22.320> aqua<00:00:22.680> clear<00:00:23.720> it's<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
box it's a flooville aqua clear it's the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
box it's a flooville aqua clear it's the
same<00:00:25.050> product<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:26.070> those<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:27.300> there

that<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.289> pool<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.119> aqua<00:00:30.119> clear

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that don't know this pool and aqua clear

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.990 
that don't know this pool and aqua clear
our<00:00:30.510> sister<00:00:30.810> companies<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.640> guess<00:00:32.880> they

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
our sister companies so I guess they

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.819 
our sister companies so I guess they
just<00:00:33.030> went<00:00:33.390> ahead<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.809> decided<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.380> change

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
just went ahead and I decided to change

just went ahead and I decided to change
it<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.489> change<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> box<00:00:36.320> but

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it up a little bit change the box but

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
it up a little bit change the box but
it's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> same<00:00:38.100> product<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.149> rated<00:00:39.510> for

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it's the same product this is rated for

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.470 
it's the same product this is rated for
200<00:00:40.379> gallons<00:00:40.980> per<00:00:41.160> hour<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:42.090> good<00:00:42.300> for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
200 gallons per hour it's good for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.510 
200 gallons per hour it's good for
twenty<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> fifty<00:00:43.260> gallon<00:00:43.800> tanks<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> reason

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
twenty to fifty gallon tanks the reason

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
twenty to fifty gallon tanks the reason
I<00:00:48.140> decided<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.410> agree<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.039> filter<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.989> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I decided to agree to this filter is it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.520 
I decided to agree to this filter is it
has<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.710> three<00:00:52.920> stages<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> filtration<00:00:54.530> it's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
has the three stages of filtration it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
has the three stages of filtration it's
better<00:00:55.739> than<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.280> currently<00:00:56.699> have

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
better than the one I currently have

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
better than the one I currently have
which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> regular<00:00:58.170> cartridge<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
which is just a regular cartridge of the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
which is just a regular cartridge of the
filter<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.050> both<00:01:01.320> other

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
filter that you you just both other

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
filter that you you just both other
cartridges<00:01:02.010> once<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:03.059> clogged<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
cartridges once they get clogged and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.910 
cartridges once they get clogged and
then<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.960> thrown<00:01:04.170> away<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> good

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
then you're thrown away all that good

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.149 
then you're thrown away all that good
bacteria<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.890> know

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
bacteria and then it just you know

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
bacteria and then it just you know
causes<00:01:08.580> problems<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.119> fish<00:01:09.390> tank<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
causes problems for your fish tank you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
causes problems for your fish tank you
need<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> pick<00:01:11.070> bacteria<00:01:11.580> building

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
need to have that pick bacteria building

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.810 
need to have that pick bacteria building
up<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.229> keep<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> clean<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
up in there to you know keep it clean to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.999 
up in there to you know keep it clean to
break<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.290> fish<00:01:16.470> waste<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
break down all the the fish waste and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.580 
break down all the the fish waste and
everything<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.900> -<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> has<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
everything so on this one - it has the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
everything so on this one - it has the
three<00:01:19.799> stages<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.580> first<00:01:20.820> stages<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
three stages the first stages of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.920 
three stages the first stages of
mechanical<00:01:22.110> which<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> sponge<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.700> has

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
mechanical which is a sponge it has

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
mechanical which is a sponge it has
chemical<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> activated<00:01:25.979> carbon

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
chemical which is the activated carbon

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.510 
chemical which is the activated carbon
and<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.720> biological<00:01:29.600> bio<00:01:30.600> max<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:32.040> plan<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and has biological bio max I plan on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
and has biological bio max I plan on
keeping<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.180> activated<00:01:33.840> carbon<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
keeping the activated carbon for a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520 
keeping the activated carbon for a
little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:34.939> pipe<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> month<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.439> I'm

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
little bit pipe on a month and then I'm

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.149 
little bit pipe on a month and then I'm
gonna<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.890> rid<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:38.820> more

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
gonna get rid of it and get some more

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
gonna get rid of it and get some more
sponge<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.299> something

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
sponge a little bit more something

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.069 
sponge a little bit more something
denser<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.490> probably<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.720> some<00:01:45.930> more

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
denser and then probably get some more

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.600 
denser and then probably get some more
bio<00:01:46.350> max<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> keep<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:50.430> build

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bio max so just you know keep to build

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.020 
bio max so just you know keep to build
up<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.799> beneficial<00:01:52.799> bacteria<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.579> bomb<00:01:53.729> max

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
up the beneficial bacteria the bomb max

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.480 
up the beneficial bacteria the bomb max
is<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> good<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.750> ceramic<00:01:55.189> guess<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
is a good little ceramic guess if you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
is a good little ceramic guess if you
could<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.479> tubes<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
could see little bit little tubes and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.340 
could see little bit little tubes and
they<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> lot<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.630> little<00:02:00.630> crevices<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.140> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
they have a lot of little crevices for a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.359 
they have a lot of little crevices for a
good<00:02:01.530> bacteria<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.009> grow<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:03.350> so

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
good bacteria to grow in there so

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
good bacteria to grow in there so
