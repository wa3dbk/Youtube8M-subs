active<00:01:55.320> digitizer<00:01:55.770> makes<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.430> unit<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
active digitizer makes a unit like this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.630 
active digitizer makes a unit like this
much<00:01:58.049> easier<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> pen<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
much easier to use because the pen is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
much easier to use because the pen is
proximity<00:02:00.030> sensitive<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
proximity sensitive so that's going to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
proximity sensitive so that's going to
be<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.610> friendly<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.360> your<00:02:03.540> user
