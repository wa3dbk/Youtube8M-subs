work practices could force it to go the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.450 
work practices could force it to go the
same<00:00:29.550> way<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.179> Holden<00:00:31.140> Ford<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> others<00:00:32.189> so

does that mean Malcolm we need to have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.270

things<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.860> think

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
things like that in the well I think

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
things like that in the well I think
what<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> means<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> need<00:00:42.120> greater

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what it means is you need greater

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
what it means is you need greater
productivity<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.760> understanding<00:00:44.789> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
productivity the my understanding is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.440 
productivity the my understanding is
that<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.079> wages<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.829> Auto<00:00:47.100> Workers<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.850> Japan

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that the wages of Auto Workers in Japan

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.830 
that the wages of Auto Workers in Japan
and<00:00:48.780> Australia<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.620> comparable<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and Australia are comparable but the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840 
and Australia are comparable but the
productivity<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.309> less<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
productivity here is a lot less and that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000 
productivity here is a lot less and that
is<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:55.199> flexibility<00:00:55.800> though

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
is that a lot more flexibility though

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.680 
is that a lot more flexibility though
and<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.430> plenty<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> people<00:00:57.030> within

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and there are plenty of people within

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020 
and there are plenty of people within
the<00:00:57.870> Liberal<00:00:58.140> Party<00:00:58.170> who<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.280> return<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the Liberal Party who want a return to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
the Liberal Party who want a return to
