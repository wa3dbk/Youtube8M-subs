00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello and welcome one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
 new in the video 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.639
 and I have a phone bag for today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 you and that is one of them 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 pike or simon pegg what's up 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.560
 exactly how you say it and you see 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.250
 already that is such a sinister one about exactly 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 it is the model new york a 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.060
 I have now here is the iphone 5 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
 but can you stop by? 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.539
 they are also available for many 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850
 other devices are actually used 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 for every cell phone that too 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.239
 possibility have a made to measure 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.940
 to order 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 for example, mars 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.530
 enter that iphone with ok too 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 or with your bumper in the cover fits 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.410
 as mentioned before this is the new yorker 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 have ligeti 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.579
 new york is the model and h is here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.340
 for that in material in my case 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:04.170
 flowers and the material is cotton 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 and outside as already mentioned 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.750
 then missing 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.619
 I would say we do not have long 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.150
 often iphone and put that there 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.580
 one and the whole comes from the side 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 purely that is matter of taste if that then 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.570
 like or not me personally city 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.110
 not one gets used to the time 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 that and i agree on the principle 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.670
 quite interesting just from the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 to do page 1 is a little something 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.890
 new and the whole is here of the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 velcro held and he morning 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.259
 just once to but simply the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 cluster is also solid so it will not work 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.880
 you can easily pull on it, too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 because nothing happens and yes that makes the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.009
 of course the thickness without doubt 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 that will protect it relatively thick 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.950
 Of course, then we also offenders 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 first falls down or as well 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.729
 always 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.229
 and at this point where the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 Velcro is there is of course only 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 but it was really annoying 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.209
 not if you have the iphone in your pocket 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.500
 has and here I have you already 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:17.400
 this is shown 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.110
 logo with his yes the logo and that will 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.410
 here both threads are kept 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.210
 I'm not sure it's possible 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.160
 be that easy mean time 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.520
 is out of the bag outside doing that 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.700
 Part of it can fall off 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.880
 there is nothing more specific to say 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 and the felt draws relatively strong 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.870
 you do not have to say that 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.160
 Jaidee may throw up now 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.840
 an open blanket or something like that then you have 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.060
 the already properly fluff off 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.510
 I am personally bothered by this until today 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.180
 especially here in the corners and 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.150
 Edges do not look so nice now 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.730
 that that annoys me a bit 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.000
 otherwise this is a nice bag 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.820
 therefore also again show the iphone 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.739
 fits optimally optimally optimal 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.360
 nothing is tailored to 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.840
 moaning is just not wobbling 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.030
 is nothing and not a big one 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.580
 gap size is a little and for 17 99 so 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 The bag is not 18 euros 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.090
 recommended for the price there 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.040
 not much to complain about 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.049
 a nice bag and as I said it 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.790
 is also for all bags one 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.150
 Made to order costs for one 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.739
 mobile phone case 93 and for a tablet 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.110
 pocket 590 he could just go on the 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.730
 Look at the page and then find it 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.209
 In any case, the partner for yours 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.700
 mobile 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.250
 As always, you will also find again more 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.810
 to that ash in my test report the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.820
 I care for you again in the video 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.980
 description so i would say that 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.489
 See you in the next video until then 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.489
 bye
