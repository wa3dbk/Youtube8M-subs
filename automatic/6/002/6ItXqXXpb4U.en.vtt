Thunderbolt enclosure has six different
drives<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:12.059> two<00:00:12.210> terabytes<00:00:12.630> each<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:12.990> up

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
drives in here two terabytes each so up

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.980 
drives in here two terabytes each so up
to<00:00:13.469> 12<00:00:13.799> terabytes<00:00:14.040> depending<00:00:14.670> how<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.990> put

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to 12 terabytes depending how you put

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.250 
to 12 terabytes depending how you put
this<00:00:16.109> all<00:00:16.320> together<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> raid<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:19.109> can

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
this all together as a as a raid you can

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.740 
this all together as a as a raid you can
test<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.529> out<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> raid<00:00:20.010> 0<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.789> 85<00:00:21.180> right

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
test it out with a raid 0 or 85 right

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
test it out with a raid 0 or 85 right
1050<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.830> different<00:00:23.250> combinations

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
1050 all different combinations

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
1050 all different combinations
depending<00:00:23.880> whether<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.810> want<00:00:24.990> raw<00:00:25.170> speed<00:00:25.529> or

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
depending whether you want raw speed or

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
depending whether you want raw speed or
whether<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.109> some

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
whether you want to have you know some

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
whether you want to have you know some
redundancy<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> drive<00:00:30.029> goes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
redundancy there like the drive goes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
redundancy there like the drive goes
down<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.750> keep<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> did<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> first

is sort of just to look around and show
you<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:37.710> drives<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> power

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you how all these drives work the power

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.970 
you how all these drives work the power
what's<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> back<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:40.710> though

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

what's on the back and this time though
we're<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> talk<00:00:41.399> about<00:00:41.520> speed<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.180> ran

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
we're going to talk about speed I ran

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.360 
we're going to talk about speed I ran
some<00:00:42.750> speed<00:00:43.170> tests<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> we'll<00:00:44.190> tell

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
some speed tests on this and we'll tell

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
some speed tests on this and we'll tell
you<00:00:44.399> how<00:00:44.460> fast<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.480> very

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you how fast is this it's actually very

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
you how fast is this it's actually very
fast<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
fast and just want to know this is the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
fast and just want to know this is the
Apple<00:00:48.000> cable<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> didn't<00:00:48.570> show<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
Apple cable I didn't show that in the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
Apple cable I didn't show that in the
unboxing<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.039> kind<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.520> look<00:00:50.700> on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
unboxing you know kind of first look on

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.189 
unboxing you know kind of first look on
that<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> could<00:00:51.239> pick<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.539> pick<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> up

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that you could pick up that pick that up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
that you could pick up that pick that up
separately<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.010> Apple<00:00:53.520> alright<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.910> let's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
separately from Apple alright so let's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
separately from Apple alright so let's
start<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:55.050> graphic<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.530> Apple's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
start here with a graphic from Apple's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.060 
start here with a graphic from Apple's
website<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.360> various

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
website I'm here you can see the various

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.619 
website I'm here you can see the various
interface<00:00:59.070> options<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.510> much

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
interface options that are pretty much

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.569 
interface options that are pretty much
out<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:00.899> Thunderbolt<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.949> top<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> two

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
out there Thunderbolt up on top the two

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
out there Thunderbolt up on top the two
channels<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> 10<00:01:03.690> gigabits<00:01:04.080> per<00:01:04.140> second<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
channels of 10 gigabits per second so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
channels of 10 gigabits per second so
not<00:01:05.129> only<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> fast<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.479> two

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
not only is it fast but you get two

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.859 
not only is it fast but you get two
channels<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.330> standard<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
channels with this standard and this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.000 
channels with this standard and this
basically<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.680> everything

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
basically is going to be on everything

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.530 
basically is going to be on everything
but<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> macbook<00:01:12.000> air<00:01:12.180> i<00:01:12.210> believe<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
but the macbook air i believe the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
but the macbook air i believe the
macbook<00:01:12.869> air<00:01:13.020> only<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> single<00:01:13.500> channel

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
macbook air only has a single channel

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.440 
macbook air only has a single channel
it's<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.310> quite<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.670> fast<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> rest<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's not quite as fast as the rest of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
it's not quite as fast as the rest of
the<00:01:15.540> desktop<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.409> note<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:17.310> USB<00:01:17.580> 3

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the desktop so just note that by USB 3

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
the desktop so just note that by USB 3
that's<00:01:18.090> still<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.330> emerging<00:01:18.509> standard<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that's still an emerging standard and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
that's still an emerging standard and
it's<00:01:19.530> only<00:01:19.680> 5<00:01:19.920> megabits<00:01:20.280> per<00:01:20.400> second<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:20.939> half

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it's only 5 megabits per second so half

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
it's only 5 megabits per second so half
of<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.689> channel<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.770> Express<00:01:23.130> card<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
USB 2 and firewire 800 if there's a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
USB 2 and firewire 800 if there's a
drive<00:01:31.680> connected<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.250> Mac<00:01:32.400> odds<00:01:32.670> aren't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
drive connected to your Mac odds aren't

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.830 
drive connected to your Mac odds aren't
that's<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.689> looking

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's what you're going to be looking

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.859 
that's what you're going to be looking
at<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> USB<00:01:34.710> 2<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> firewire<00:01:35.670> 800<00:01:35.939> firewire

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
at is USB 2 and firewire 800 firewire

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.200 
at is USB 2 and firewire 800 firewire
800<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> pretty<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.579> best<00:01:38.909> bet<00:01:39.180> for

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
800 was a pretty much your best bet for

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179 
800 was a pretty much your best bet for
external<00:01:39.689> storage<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
external storage and now you can see the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
external storage and now you can see the
potential<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.570> Thunderbolt<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> bringing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
potential on the Thunderbolt is bringing

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.090 
potential on the Thunderbolt is bringing
right<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.280> tested<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> macbook<00:01:45.630> pro

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
right so I tested this on a macbook pro

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
right so I tested this on a macbook pro
2011<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.820> newest<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.270> using<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
2011 on the newest one using the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
2011 on the newest one using the
Thunderbolt<00:01:49.500> port<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
Thunderbolt port and here are some of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.569 
Thunderbolt port and here are some of
the<00:01:50.820> results<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.390> found<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:53.070> fast<00:01:53.399> i

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the results i found it is very fast i

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
the results i found it is very fast i
use<00:01:53.729> x<00:01:54.000> bench<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> composite<00:01:55.259> score

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
use x bench this is a composite score

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.819 
use x bench this is a composite score
which<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.549> good<00:01:56.759> mixed<00:01:57.149> use

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
which i think is a pretty good mixed use

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.929 
which i think is a pretty good mixed use
example<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.850> they

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
example of what this is you know so they

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
example of what this is you know so they
have<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> random<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
have the random and and you know

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.969 
have the random and and you know
constant<00:02:02.729> read<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.270> write<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.899> cash<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
constant read and write and cash and all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.950 
constant read and write and cash and all
that<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.930> know

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that so it's pretty good you know

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
that so it's pretty good you know
gauntlet<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.920> tests<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.970> not

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
gauntlet of tests to do it it's not

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.969 
gauntlet of tests to do it it's not
going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> favor<00:02:09.509> any<00:02:09.840> particular<00:02:10.560> type<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
going to favor any particular type of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.370 
going to favor any particular type of
you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:11.879> disk<00:02:12.209> activity

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you know disk activity

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.440 
you know disk activity
and<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.220> sad<00:02:14.400> down<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.970> bottom<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and so so sad down the bottom that is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.720 
and so so sad down the bottom that is
the<00:02:15.750> internal<00:02:16.080> drive<00:02:16.410> firewire<00:02:17.010> firewire

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the internal drive firewire firewire

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.510 
the internal drive firewire firewire
raid5<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.660> firewire<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> single<00:02:19.560> Drive<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
raid5 the firewire is a single Drive it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.160 
raid5 the firewire is a single Drive it
looks<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.090> about<00:02:21.270> maxing<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:21.990> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
looks like that's about maxing out you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
looks like that's about maxing out you
know<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> firewire<00:02:22.890> port<00:02:23.340> right<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
know the firewire port right there that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
know the firewire port right there that
we're<00:02:24.150> seeing<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> r6<00:02:26.190> as

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
we're seeing and then we have the r6 as

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.730 
we're seeing and then we have the r6 as
a<00:02:26.340> raid<00:02:26.580> 5<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.150> then<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.440> want<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
a raid 5 and then if you really want to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.980 
a raid 5 and then if you really want to
go<00:02:28.860> nuts<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.490> put<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> raid<00:02:30.270> 0<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
go nuts you can put it as a raid 0 and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.320 
go nuts you can put it as a raid 0 and
that<00:02:31.200> thing<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.860> fast<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.150> kind<00:02:33.300> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that thing is fast and you're kind of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.690 
that thing is fast and you're kind of
saying<00:02:33.540> okay<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:34.110> fast<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.670> is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
saying okay how fast is that so this is

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.420 
saying okay how fast is that so this is
the<00:02:35.940> raid<00:02:36.420> 5<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.800> disk<00:02:38.070> speed

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the raid 5 and this is the disk speed

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
the raid 5 and this is the disk speed
test<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.600> basically<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.230> does<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> constant

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
test this basically just does a constant

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.880 
test this basically just does a constant
you<00:02:42.240> know<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.450> kind<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.960> stress<00:02:43.260> test<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
you know it's kind of stress test of the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
you know it's kind of stress test of the
drive<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.880> pretty<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:45.240> we're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
drive and this is pretty much what we're

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.040 
drive and this is pretty much what we're
looking<00:02:45.960> at<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> raid<00:02:46.860> 5<00:02:47.190> about<00:02:48.120> 528<00:02:48.750> Meg

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
looking at as a raid 5 about 528 Meg

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.680 
looking at as a raid 5 about 528 Meg
megabytes<00:02:49.770> megabytes<00:02:50.700> per<00:02:51.030> second<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.660> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
megabytes megabytes per second as a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.830 
megabytes megabytes per second as a
right<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.410> about<00:02:52.590> 323<00:02:53.580> read<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.210> if<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.690> bring

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
right and about 323 read and if we bring

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.500 
right and about 323 read and if we bring
that<00:02:55.020> on<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.470> raid<00:02:55.800> 0<00:02:56.250> we're<00:02:57.120> looking<00:02:57.420> at

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that on to the raid 0 we're looking at

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.660 
that on to the raid 0 we're looking at
six<00:02:57.840> seventy<00:02:58.290> eight<00:02:58.470> megabytes<00:02:58.830> per<00:02:59.190> second

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
six seventy eight megabytes per second

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.100 
six seventy eight megabytes per second
and<00:03:00.800> 543<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.070> wreath<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.030> pretty<00:03:03.690> fast

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and 543 as a wreath this is pretty fast

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.110 
and 543 as a wreath this is pretty fast
stuff<00:03:04.530> right<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.220> what's<00:03:05.910> really

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
stuff right so that's what's really

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.270 
stuff right so that's what's really
interesting<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.470> super<00:03:07.800> fast<00:03:08.040> you're

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
interesting is this is super fast you're

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.430 
interesting is this is super fast you're
getting<00:03:08.460> SSD<00:03:09.000> speeds<00:03:09.360> actually<00:03:09.690> beyond<00:03:09.960> SSD

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
getting SSD speeds actually beyond SSD
