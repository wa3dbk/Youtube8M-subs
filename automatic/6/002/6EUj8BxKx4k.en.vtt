00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:30.610
 The trap is made with a drum of wine or water. 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:01:01.719
 It is drilled with a hot bean can and the beak of a plastic bottle is placed. 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:26.090
 The entire drum should be drilled with a hot nail. 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:02:16.970
 Place a plumb line underneath and place a string on the handle. 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:03:22.730
 When using it place little dry bread and you will see how effective it is.
