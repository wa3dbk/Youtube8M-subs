when<00:01:02.940> compared<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> high<00:01:03.899> resolution<00:01:04.559> color

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
when compared to high resolution color

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
when compared to high resolution color
screens<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> definitely<00:01:06.090> does<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> job

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
screens but it definitely does the job

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060

and<00:01:06.750> it'll<00:01:06.840> do<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> job<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.620> use<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:08.040> less

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and it'll do the job and use a lot less

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.570 
and it'll do the job and use a lot less
battery<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.060> color<00:01:09.630> counterparts<00:01:10.580> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
battery then color counterparts it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
battery then color counterparts it's
worth<00:01:11.790> noting<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.780> inbuilt<00:01:13.200> mic

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
worth noting there the inbuilt mic

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
worth noting there the inbuilt mic
receives<00:01:14.130> calls<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.580> via<00:01:14.820> bluetooth<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.480> even

receives calls up via bluetooth and even
supports<00:01:16.290> HD<00:01:16.950> calls<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.970> cool

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
supports HD calls which is very cool

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
supports HD calls which is very cool
it's<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.260> new<00:01:19.560> sensors<00:01:20.160> as<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.460> you've<00:01:20.580> gone

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it's got new sensors as well you've gone

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's got new sensors as well you've gone
altimeters<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.660> it'll<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.050> able<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> measure

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
altimeters so it'll be able to measure

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.140 
altimeters so it'll be able to measure
how<00:01:22.860> high<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.880> they'll<00:01:24.000> measure

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
how high you're going so they'll measure

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.290 
how high you're going so they'll measure
stairs<00:01:24.720> etc<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.070> toggle<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.730> music<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
stairs etc you can toggle your music it

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.390 
stairs etc you can toggle your music it
can<00:01:27.450> receive<00:01:27.720> notifications<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.710> effectively

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
can receive notifications so effectively

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.430 
can receive notifications so effectively
act<00:01:29.760> as<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> SmartWatch<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> source<00:01:30.990> while

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
act as a SmartWatch of source while

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.680 
act as a SmartWatch of source while
still<00:01:31.860> looking<00:01:32.190> relatively<00:01:32.880> demure<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
still looking relatively demure and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.110 
still looking relatively demure and
simple<00:01:34.170> especially<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> opt<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.640> more

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
simple especially if you opt for a more

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.330 
simple especially if you opt for a more
subtle<00:01:36.390> color<00:01:36.900> scheme<00:01:37.230> if<00:01:37.440> we<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> next<00:01:38.190> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
subtle color scheme if we put it next to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.400 
subtle color scheme if we put it next to
how<00:01:38.520> its<00:01:38.700> Samsung<00:01:39.180> gear<00:01:39.510> live<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
how its Samsung gear live you can see it

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.010 
how its Samsung gear live you can see it
takes<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:41.010> lot<00:01:41.220> less<00:01:41.730> space<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.630> wrist<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
takes a lot less space on the wrist and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.680 
takes a lot less space on the wrist and
it<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.830> feels<00:01:44.130> less<00:01:44.700> imposing<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.450> on

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
it actually feels less imposing to on

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.840 
it actually feels less imposing to on
surprisingly<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.220> should<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.640> around

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
surprisingly so that should be around

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330 
surprisingly so that should be around
the<00:01:48.420> end<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.870> year<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.830> pricing<00:01:50.310> for
