we did that it we didn't know was gonna

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
we did that it we didn't know was gonna
come<00:02:56.130> out<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:56.670> we're<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:56.940> very<00:02:57.299> lucky

that<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:59.100> hard<00:02:59.280> work<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.700> put<00:02:59.730> in<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
that the hard work that we put in is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.400 
that the hard work that we put in is
starting<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> pay<00:03:00.510> off<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:00.989> there's<00:03:01.230> still

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
starting to pay off I mean there's still

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.259 
starting to pay off I mean there's still
a<00:03:01.440> lot<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> hard<00:03:01.890> work<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.070> go<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.730> playing<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
a lot of hard work to go to playing a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.330 
a lot of hard work to go to playing a
cello<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.720> reach<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.959> goal<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.590> think

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
cello and reach your goal but I think

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.670 
cello and reach your goal but I think
it's<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.150> good<00:03:06.480> start<00:03:06.750> right<00:03:06.810> now<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.200> think<00:03:07.560> it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
it's a good start right now I think it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.280 
it's a good start right now I think it's
something<00:03:08.430> special<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:09.060> sure<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.600> think

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
something special for sure and I think

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.050 
something special for sure and I think
like<00:03:11.130> most<00:03:11.190> guys<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.670> kind<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.850> get<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> little

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
like most guys you kind of get a little

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150 
like most guys you kind of get a little
nervous<00:03:12.269> obviously<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.530> bigger<00:03:13.680> step<00:03:13.920> up

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
nervous obviously it's a bigger step up

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.460 
nervous obviously it's a bigger step up
but<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.970> definitely<00:03:15.090> makes<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.540> easier<00:03:16.260> with

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
but it definitely makes it easier with

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.770 
but it definitely makes it easier with
even<00:03:17.190> NIC<00:03:17.640> petan<00:03:17.910> being<00:03:18.180> here<00:03:18.299> as<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> teammate

even NIC petan being here as a teammate

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.990 
even NIC petan being here as a teammate
and<00:03:18.989> I'm<00:03:19.410> kind<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.860> over<00:03:20.160> with<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.430> last

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
and I'm kind of going over with it last

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.479

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:30.399 
year when he came back to Portland so
it's<00:03:23.489> definitely<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.970> special<00:03:24.570> situation

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409
