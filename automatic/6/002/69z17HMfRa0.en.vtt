00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
Sanwa parts installed from the get-go so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640 
Sanwa parts installed from the get-go so
once<00:00:20.789> again<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> PlayStation<00:00:21.779> 3<00:00:22.140> stick

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the sound of these buttons and I really

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
the sound of these buttons and I really
like<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> softer

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like that because it's it's not a softer

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
button when you buy these is usually

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.800 
button when you buy these is usually
about<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.550> dollar<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:45.600> here<00:03:45.750> you're

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
about a dollar so right here you're

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.630 
about a dollar so right here you're
talking<00:03:45.989> 810<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.190> Joyce<00:03:47.340> they<00:03:47.459> probably

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
talking 810 this is Joyce they probably

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.220 
talking 810 this is Joyce they probably
would<00:03:47.820> have<00:03:47.880> been<00:03:47.970> five<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.870> maybe<00:03:49.050> they're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
would have been five so maybe they're

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.350 
would have been five so maybe they're
making<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.500> $5<00:03:50.160> profit<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.940> fact<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.269> they

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
making a $5 profit on the fact that they

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.210 
making a $5 profit on the fact that they
put<00:03:51.510> Sanwa<00:03:51.900> parts<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.680> think<00:03:53.100> that's

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
put Sanwa parts in here I think that's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.470 
put Sanwa parts in here I think that's
well<00:03:53.489> worth<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.880> rather<00:03:54.030> than<00:03:54.209> having<00:03:54.360> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
well worth it rather than having to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.180 
well worth it rather than having to
worry<00:03:54.660> about<00:03:54.840> taking<00:03:55.019> apart<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.530> stick<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
trying to modify it to get better parts

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.170 
trying to modify it to get better parts
in<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:59.070> stick<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.609> really<00:04:00.030> good
