00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to coordinate with one another so it's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
about what colors complement one another

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.730 
about what colors complement one another

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.460 
definitely see that nudes and neutrals
are<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> huge<00:02:03.270> trend<00:02:03.840> coming<00:02:04.259> up

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
are going to be a huge trend coming up

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.380 
are going to be a huge trend coming up
this<00:02:04.619> next<00:02:04.979> year<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.400> do<00:02:05.759> believe<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this next year I do believe this

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.760 
this next year I do believe this
collection<00:02:06.900> wasn't<00:02:07.259> supposed<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.650> be

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
collection wasn't supposed to be

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.589 
collection wasn't supposed to be
released<00:02:08.009> until<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.629> january<00:02:10.019> of<00:02:10.560> 2014

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
released until I think january of 2014

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.870 
released until I think january of 2014
but<00:02:12.599> i<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.830> they<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.640> sale<00:02:14.849> now

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
but i think that they are for sale now

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.559 
but i think that they are for sale now
showing<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.140> now

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
showing you this now

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.020 
showing you this now
in<00:02:16.900> case<00:02:17.109> you<00:02:17.290> can't<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.310> case<00:02:18.489> shipping

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
in case you can't and in case shipping

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.729 
in case you can't and in case shipping
obviously<00:02:19.599> takes<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.079> least<00:02:20.109> two<00:02:20.499> to<00:02:20.709> three

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
obviously takes at least two to three

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.739 
obviously takes at least two to three
days<00:02:21.099> so<00:02:21.459> you'll<00:02:21.879> get<00:02:21.999> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.329> sneak<00:02:22.510> peek

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
days so you'll get a little sneak peek

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.300 
days so you'll get a little sneak peek
and<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.170> able<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.379> choose<00:02:23.650> what<00:02:23.859> colors<00:02:24.129> you

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
I have a twitter where I post a lot of

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.360 
I have a twitter where I post a lot of
deals<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.789> i<00:06:14.909> find<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:16.259> other<00:06:16.379> day<00:06:16.590> at<00:06:16.710> CBS<00:06:17.159> i

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
deals that i find the other day at CBS i

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.980 
deals that i find the other day at CBS i
think<00:06:17.610> i<00:06:17.759> found<00:06:17.789> like<00:06:18.210> seventy-five<00:06:18.780> percent

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
think i found like seventy-five percent

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.159 
think i found like seventy-five percent
off<00:06:19.259> of<00:06:19.289> a<00:06:19.650> lot<00:06:20.400> of<00:06:20.580> makeup<00:06:20.849> and<00:06:21.240> I<00:06:21.689> stocked<00:06:22.020> up

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
off of a lot of makeup and I stocked up

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.439 
off of a lot of makeup and I stocked up
on<00:06:22.289> physicians<00:06:22.740> formula<00:06:23.009> I<00:06:23.460> think<00:06:23.909> cost<00:06:24.240> me

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
on physicians formula I think cost me

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.679 
on physicians formula I think cost me
eight<00:06:24.689> dollars<00:06:25.080> total<00:06:25.469> instead<00:06:26.159> of<00:06:26.250> 55<00:06:26.849> so<00:06:27.300> if

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
eight dollars total instead of 55 so if

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.270 
eight dollars total instead of 55 so if
you're<00:06:28.020> interested<00:06:28.379> in<00:06:28.469> those<00:06:28.590> type<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.860> deals

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
pinterest but for purchasing it's like

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.839 
pinterest but for purchasing it's like
the<00:06:55.080> loboc<00:06:55.409> receding<00:06:55.949> that's<00:06:56.159> happening<00:06:56.699> now

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
the loboc receding that's happening now

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.999 
the loboc receding that's happening now
with<00:06:56.909> everybody<00:06:57.659> on<00:06:57.840> youtube<00:06:58.229> too<00:06:58.469> but<00:06:58.979> i

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
with everybody on youtube too but i

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.010 
with everybody on youtube too but i
think<00:06:59.250> this<00:06:59.370> was<00:06:59.610> like<00:06:59.789> the<00:06:59.819> og<00:07:00.389> of<00:07:00.419> all<00:07:00.719> that

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
think this was like the og of all that

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.409 
think this was like the og of all that
so<00:07:01.349> if<00:07:01.949> it<00:07:02.219> was<00:07:02.250> i'm<00:07:02.639> just<00:07:02.849> going<00:07:02.969> to<00:07:03.000> keep<00:07:03.210> that

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
so if it was i'm just going to keep that

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:13.010 
so if it was i'm just going to keep that
instead<00:07:03.750> of<00:07:03.810> luvocracy.com<00:07:11.750> but<00:07:12.750> i<00:07:12.779> think

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
instead of luvocracy.com but i think

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.930 
instead of luvocracy.com but i think
that's<00:07:13.199> it<00:07:13.349> so<00:07:13.650> I'll<00:07:14.250> see<00:07:14.669> you<00:07:14.699> guys<00:07:14.819> later
