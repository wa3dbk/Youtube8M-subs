00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.180
 open the bar that is below making 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.160
 supporting themselves they follow the button and they put 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.190
 the programs that a program that have 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.540
 in there is not going to serve them 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.890

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.650
