the hose number one here okay so what
we're<00:01:32.840> doing<00:01:32.870> is<00:01:33.410> threading<00:01:34.010> on<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.250> first<00:01:34.520> 1i

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
we're doing is threading on the first 1i

we're doing is threading on the first 1i
already<00:01:35.540> peaked<00:01:35.900> in<00:01:36.110> there<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.440> see<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.620> I

of course shouldn't leak so everything
should<00:01:42.500> always<00:01:43.010> not<00:01:43.490> need<00:01:43.790> much<00:01:44.000> more<00:01:44.060> than

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
should always not need much more than

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.540 
should always not need much more than
hand<00:01:44.630> tightening<00:01:45.080> yeah<00:01:45.470> just<00:01:45.740> hand<00:01:46.040> tight<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
hand tightening yeah just hand tight I
