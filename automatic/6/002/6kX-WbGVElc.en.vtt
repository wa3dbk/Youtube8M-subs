00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hi all friends most popular 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.200
 video on another channel where they were until 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 do and tserateli unfortunately there were many 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.370
 controversy about this video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.259
 really there was such a thing right away 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 it was easier to polish the car first 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 breading is your time what are your 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 money is not yourself and you have both 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.500
 so the whole more indicative fight 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.760
 happening 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.490
 now we'll get to it 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 this video will be two parts 1 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.750
 I wonder how to remove minor scratches 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.579
 used your car will be here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.829
 we had no scratches and enough 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 serious earth itself is not wonderful 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 leaves and the second part is no longer hanging on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 current from so these faults 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.710
 I will be eliminating further here 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.500
 everyone had life such a situation when 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 angels either wipe you 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.969
 in the parking lot in general I already did in the form 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 because how to eliminate scratches will be glad 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.010
 why is it a lot of criticism saying 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.359
 it would be easier to polish told me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 what to do as they said nonsense 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.880
 really kind of it like that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.290
 scratch polishing is no longer 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.750
 have me strong enough other 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.430
 lexus and immediately want to say it in advance 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 what am i going to do now 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.830
 temporary measure because up firstly 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.430
 in the evenings 100 people are decent 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.280
 captured 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.200
 for making repairs but arm 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 the question is when you are a politician in the modern world 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.580
 the main problem is not so much 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 money bitch lack of time and therefore 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.990
 until we got to the chiropractors field 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.120
 what so for not so striking I 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.850
 do it yourself in order to 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.280
 further we were able to ride safely and and 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 such that it will completely remove these 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.130
 scratches that are clearly visible here on 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.840
 video for this first we want to know 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.170
 real real picture is here now 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 the seventh fret sometimes spend their income 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.380
 this paint has no time and no 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.520
 angels apt-1s so still weir 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.649
 silver is clearly visible now 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.409
 my car to clean someone else 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.330
 paint i will use the usual if 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.510
 you don't have gasoline 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.110
 you can perfectly interest and ordinary water 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.620
 just have to rub longer so 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.940
 I take 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.459
 neatly wet the cloth with gasoline 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 it is highly undesirable to smoke at the same time 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:31.670
 bullshit is on fire and quietly starting 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.620
 wipe and while I wash want to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.400
 say what if you want by 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.489
 insurance 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.230
 so that a bad company appreciates you 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.390
 ok he paid for the money 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.470
 your damage is of course all that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860
 need to start after 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.329
 insurance will appreciate you instead of gasoline 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.950
 I highly recommend not using 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.970
 solvent is not afraid before because 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.170
 otherwise you can only make it worse by 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.170
 incense real picture 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.159
 it can be seen that there is a very deep furrow 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.280
 literally completely stripped the paint and 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.780
 In general, literally steep cock played 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.629
 most likely door corner 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.299
 passed and here it is unfortunately not for 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.870
 polished unequivocally this is a hundred 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.290
 percent paint here too like 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.799
 paint dye more that paint 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.280
 moved away 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.420
 but from most minor scratches 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.879
 who have already gone 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.959
 they are taught to eliminate using the brake 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.959
 liquids so probably still are 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.750
 use water 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.430
 just to keep it clean 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.590
 by the way if you have unlike me 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.260
 the machine does not crash two times x is equal to a 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.410
 already reached the patterns 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.790
 leave it wrong so it will be necessary 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.239
 treat at least automotive varnish 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.690
 colorless is sold in any 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.970
 auto shop 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.480
 gentlemen bright it costs a penny and 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.840
 least you do not allow corrosion on 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.350
 a kind of bags chiropractor 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.130
 brake fluid is in general 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.930
 all the same place on it is written 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.880
 break field and usually to 4 or something 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.930
 something like that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.870
 Russian need not even know how it is 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.410
 everything looks like Russian cars never 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.560
 didn't take 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.560
 need to literally take me 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.830
 and we will continue to polish where there is a clear 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.830
 scratch training terms known eat 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.800
 I take it almost as you see gone 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.090
 further very strong consciously here 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.570
 roundabouts play black 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.120
 you now she leaves these he year 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:28.669
 pink and black scratch still clearly visible 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:31.389
 I like this and when Black goes away 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.389
 clouds on the carbine 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.590
 Once again I repeat the usual polished it 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.280
 but unfortunately the brake would not go away 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.479
 liquid too 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.479
 miracles do not speak 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.980
 it is absolutely all life is 3 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.830
 and about how the country has these problems 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.360
 just click on the second video again 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 I repeat not a chiropractor and the fact that I 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.720
 now did not know what I will not 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.280
 never che repair issue 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.680
 just because I gain time for 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.460
 spending 15 minutes and then 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.170
 do so and when it is convenient for me 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.230
 any such minor accident 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.780
 it is not very nice not always included 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.360
 your plans but all if there is someone 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.470
 supplier and so above the axis does so 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:27.630
 you have already deleted grandfather diligently left 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:32.730
 from i'm a foam problem when giving up 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:34.800
 inheritance hurts when the blow fell 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.610
 on this side for now there will be questions 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.060
 stupid twist the world and drove a friend she 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:46.370
 left a little bit right and here and there not 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.780
 hooked only the outer part here and 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.000
 the second problem we have in general 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.190
 here it was extremely well done 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.070
 that is, now they jump up something 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.810
 do not have to but still if you 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.270
 the scratch is not completely gone he's such a tone 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.200
 and it is likely you need to buy some 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.250
 anything polishing paste for paint and 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.370
 further process the car also 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.990
 polishing paste 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.390
 I won't do it now 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.130
 no, no, no, well, let's say 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.410
 if you want to do everything ideally 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.480
 take for starters 10 they stay they 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.480
 a little more noticeable on cotton can 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.700
 add tinting paste 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:30.190
 afraid to drag, he opened a little 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.850
 I will not display much here I will not 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.430
 chiropractor 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.760
 and tint here these small places 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.760
 now
