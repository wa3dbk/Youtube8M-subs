00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
very bottom shelf I find this kind of

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.689 
very bottom shelf I find this kind of
funky<00:00:54.199> looking<00:00:54.469> box<00:00:54.679> and<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.070> thought<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.609> that

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
funky looking box and I thought is that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
what I think it is you pull it out this

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.709 
what I think it is you pull it out this
is<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.949> an<00:00:58.100> schematic<00:00:58.760> deluxe<00:00:59.120> developing

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
is the an schematic deluxe developing

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.459 
is the an schematic deluxe developing
outfit<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.640> what<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:01.789> is<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.719> this<00:01:03.230> was<00:01:03.440> a

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
outfit and what this is is this was a

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.410 
outfit and what this is is this was a
home<00:01:03.739> development<00:01:04.280> kit<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.489> making<00:01:04.909> contact

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
home development kit for making contact

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050 
home development kit for making contact
prints<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:07.040> receipt<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.640> dug<00:01:07.880> out<00:01:08.000> of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
prints and the receipt that I dug out of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.550 
prints and the receipt that I dug out of
here<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.480> dated<00:01:09.159> 1969<00:01:10.159> from<00:01:10.430> Kmart<00:01:10.940> and

here is dated 1969 from Kmart and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.320 
here is dated 1969 from Kmart and
basically<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.070> exactly<00:01:13.610> how<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:13.880> can<00:01:14.180> do

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
basically this is exactly how you can do

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.390 
basically this is exactly how you can do
some<00:01:14.570> black<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:14.870> white<00:01:15.170> film<00:01:16.010> printing<00:01:16.310> at

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
some black and white film printing at

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.060 
some black and white film printing at
home<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.600> kind<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.140> two-way<00:01:18.680> kid

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
home this is kind of a two-way kid

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100 
home this is kind of a two-way kid
because<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.939> designed<00:01:20.509> for<00:01:20.720> for

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
because this is designed for for

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.109 
because this is designed for for
developing<00:01:21.560> film<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:22.610> also<00:01:22.759> doing

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
developing film and then also doing

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.460 
developing film and then also doing
what's<00:01:23.270> called<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.540> contact<00:01:24.020> print<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:24.439> a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
what's called a contact print now a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.510 
what's called a contact print now a
contact<00:01:24.979> print<00:01:25.329> basically<00:01:26.329> is<00:01:26.540> where<00:01:26.869> you

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
contact print basically is where you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.830 
contact print basically is where you
simply<00:01:28.520> use<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> light<00:01:29.000> source<00:01:29.240> lay<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
simply use a light source lay the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.870 
simply use a light source lay the
negative<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.619> top<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> piece<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
negative on top of the piece of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.550 
negative on top of the piece of
developing<00:01:32.299> paper<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.869> then<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.409> lives

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
developing paper and then the lives

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.200 
developing paper and then the lives
projected<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.280> contact<00:01:34.640> print<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.030> just

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
projected so the contact print is just

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.030 
projected so the contact print is just
by<00:01:35.299> setting<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.049> negative<00:01:36.350> onto<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.680> paper

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
by setting the negative onto the paper

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.560 
by setting the negative onto the paper
there's<00:01:37.369> no<00:01:37.520> enlarging<00:01:38.000> involved<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
there's no enlarging involved so the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.819 
there's no enlarging involved so the
negative<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.049> print<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.439> going<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.649> be<00:01:39.710> the

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
negative the print is going to be the

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.469 
negative the print is going to be the
size<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.280> negative<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.060> for<00:01:41.240> something

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
size of the negative so for something

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.910 
size of the negative so for something
like<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.719> you<00:01:41.899> wouldn't<00:01:42.079> want<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.350> use<00:01:42.469> 35

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
like this you wouldn't want to use 35

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.200 
like this you wouldn't want to use 35
millimeter<00:01:43.430> film<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.789> because<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:44.090> going

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
millimeter film just because it's going

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.080 
millimeter film just because it's going
to<00:01:44.270> be<00:01:44.360> really<00:01:44.539> small<00:01:44.979> but<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.700> designed

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
to be really small but this is designed

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.450 
to be really small but this is designed
to<00:01:47.240> use<00:01:47.270> with<00:01:47.420> medium<00:01:48.020> format<00:01:48.259> film<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.979> I

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
to use with medium format film and I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.670 
to use with medium format film and I
thought<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.180> for<00:01:50.509> 20<00:01:50.659> bucks<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.259> can't<00:01:51.469> think

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
thought well for 20 bucks I can't think

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.429 
thought well for 20 bucks I can't think
of<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.829> better<00:01:51.979> way<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.579> could<00:01:53.200> talk<00:01:54.200> about

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
of a better way that I could talk about

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.950 
of a better way that I could talk about
darkroom<00:01:54.950> teach<00:01:55.219> darkroom<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.000> use<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
darkroom teach darkroom and use the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.660 
darkroom teach darkroom and use the
Holga<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.439> at<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:57.710> time<00:01:57.740> since<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> Holga<00:01:58.490> is

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
Holga all at one time since the Holga is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.880 
Holga all at one time since the Holga is
a<00:01:58.789> medium<00:01:59.090> format<00:01:59.329> camera<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.079> anyway<00:02:00.799> I'm

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
a medium format camera so anyway I'm

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.230 
a medium format camera so anyway I'm
going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.070> kind<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.280> pull<00:02:01.549> this<00:02:01.640> open<00:02:01.850> here<00:02:02.119> so

going to kind of pull this open here so
you<00:02:02.329> can<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.630> what's<00:02:02.810> inside<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.590> we'll<00:02:04.159> talk

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
you can see what's inside and we'll talk

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.370 
you can see what's inside and we'll talk
about<00:02:04.490> some<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.850> these<00:02:04.939> things<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.630> do<00:02:05.899> want<00:02:06.350> to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
about some of these things I do want to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.959 
about some of these things I do want to
note<00:02:06.560> here<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.070> plastic<00:02:07.490> cover<00:02:07.759> is

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
note here that this plastic cover is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.330 
note here that this plastic cover is
your<00:02:08.210> print<00:02:08.450> wash<00:02:08.660> tray<00:02:08.990> do<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.770> destroy<00:02:10.190> it

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
your print wash tray do not destroy it

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.400 
your print wash tray do not destroy it
it's<00:02:11.150> very<00:02:11.330> important<00:02:11.720> information<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it's very important information so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.680 
it's very important information so
anyway<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.070> basically<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.540> is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
anyway but basically this is this is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.360 
anyway but basically this is this is
what<00:02:14.810> Aloha<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.230> self<00:02:15.470> contained<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:15.980> you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
what Aloha this self contained so you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.520 
what Aloha this self contained so you
know<00:02:16.460> that's<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.510> your<00:02:17.690> what<00:02:18.410> you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
know that's going to be your what you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.960 
know that's going to be your what you
used<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.860> it's<00:02:19.310> gonna<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.610> tray<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.820> can

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
used to it's gonna be the tray you can

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.460 
used to it's gonna be the tray you can
fill<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.180> water<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.540> wash<00:02:20.900> our<00:02:21.110> prints<00:02:21.380> in

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
fill with water and wash our prints in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.540 
fill with water and wash our prints in
there<00:02:21.560> when<00:02:21.680> we're<00:02:21.770> done<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.040> does<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> lip

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
there when we're done it does have a lip

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.280 
there when we're done it does have a lip
over<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.180> very<00:02:23.570> cleverly<00:02:24.050> designed

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
over on the side very cleverly designed

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.080 
over on the side very cleverly designed
they<00:02:25.010> don't<00:02:25.160> make<00:02:25.280> things<00:02:25.490> like<00:02:25.670> they<00:02:25.760> used<00:02:25.940> to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
they don't make things like they used to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.580 
they don't make things like they used to
do<00:02:26.210> they

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
do they

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.070 
do they
okay<00:02:26.709> first<00:02:27.250> off<00:02:27.459> we<00:02:27.819> have<00:02:28.030> some<00:02:28.540> directions

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
okay first off we have some directions

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.290 
okay first off we have some directions
which<00:02:29.860> are<00:02:30.040> kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> mangled<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.940> yellowed

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
which are kind of mangled and yellowed

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.390 
which are kind of mangled and yellowed
but<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.569> do<00:02:31.629> tell<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.110> how<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.290> handle<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
but they do tell you how to handle the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.100 
but they do tell you how to handle the
film<00:02:33.640> developing<00:02:34.120> part<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.599> there<00:02:35.019> are<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
film developing part of this there are a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.420 
film developing part of this there are a
few<00:02:35.200> pieces<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.709> kit<00:02:35.920> that's<00:02:36.099> missing

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
few pieces of this kit that's missing

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.250 
few pieces of this kit that's missing
but<00:02:36.550> all<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:36.879> it's<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.930> pretty<00:02:38.140> good

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
but all in all it's it's in pretty good

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.699 
but all in all it's it's in pretty good
shape

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
shape

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.290 
shape
you<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.040> three<00:02:39.250> trays<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.000> we're

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
you have three trays here and we're

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.430 
you have three trays here and we're
going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.450> talk<00:02:40.599> about<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.930> process<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.379> what

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
going to talk about the process of what

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.770 
going to talk about the process of what
that<00:02:41.680> does<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> second<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:43.269> also<00:02:43.360> came

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that does in just a second it also came

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.589 
that does in just a second it also came
with<00:02:44.049> some<00:02:44.370> 1960s<00:02:45.370> vivid<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.330> and

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
with some 1960s vivid all and

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.690 
with some 1960s vivid all and
co-developer<00:02:47.349> two<00:02:47.680> packets<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.549> is

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
co-developer two packets of that it is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.520 
co-developer two packets of that it is
powder<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.629> have<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> mix<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.410> there

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
powder so you have to mix it so there

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.750 
powder so you have to mix it so there
probably<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:51.040> don't<00:02:51.310> know<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.430> they're<00:02:51.549> still

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
probably I don't know if they're still

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.180 
probably I don't know if they're still
good<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:52.540> we<00:02:52.660> might<00:02:52.810> try<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.170> see<00:02:53.260> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
good but we might try it and see and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.979 
good but we might try it and see and
then<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.459> do<00:02:54.519> have<00:02:54.700> some<00:02:55.060> developing<00:02:55.599> papers

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
then I do have some developing papers

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:56.970 
then I do have some developing papers
and<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.290> can<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.739> going<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> make

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and you can see this is going to make

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.979 
and you can see this is going to make
very<00:02:57.220> small<00:02:57.310> prints<00:02:58.060> when<00:02:58.569> all<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.780> said<00:02:58.959> and

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
very small prints when all is said and

00:02:58.989 --> 00:02:59.850 
very small prints when all is said and
done<00:02:59.079> but<00:02:59.170> remember<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> said<00:02:59.739> they<00:02:59.829> are

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
done but remember I said they are

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.530 
done but remember I said they are
contact<00:03:00.489> prints<00:03:00.819> that's<00:03:01.180> why<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.329> want<00:03:01.510> to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
contact prints that's why you want to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.569 
contact prints that's why you want to
use<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.750> larger<00:03:02.230> format<00:03:02.620> not<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.099> large<00:03:03.310> format

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
use a larger format not a large format

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.770 
use a larger format not a large format
in<00:03:03.730> our<00:03:03.790> case<00:03:04.000> we're<00:03:04.180> gonna<00:03:04.239> use<00:03:04.360> medium

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780

one thing that it remember you call it

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.920 
one thing that it remember you call it
the<00:03:33.579> darkroom<00:03:33.940> because<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.389> does<00:03:34.660> need<00:03:34.840> to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
the darkroom because it does need to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.050 
the darkroom because it does need to
stay<00:03:35.139> dark<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:36.700> you're<00:03:36.850> developing

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
stay dark and when you're developing

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.300 
stay dark and when you're developing
film<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.690> need<00:03:37.870> everything<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.709> complete

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
film you need everything in complete

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.770 
film you need everything in complete
darkness<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.760> can't<00:03:39.970> use<00:03:40.120> safe<00:03:40.359> lights<00:03:40.600> with

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
darkness you can't use safe lights with

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.379 
darkness you can't use safe lights with
film<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:41.319> too<00:03:41.470> sensitive<00:03:41.859> simply<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
film it's just too sensitive simply and

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.930 
film it's just too sensitive simply and
so<00:03:43.709> well<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.980> lights<00:03:45.190> are<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.639> actually

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
so well the lights are for is actually

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.449 
so well the lights are for is actually
when<00:03:46.030> you're<00:03:46.120> doing<00:03:46.299> print<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:47.769> plain

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
when you're doing print and in plain

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.620 
when you're doing print and in plain
terms<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:48.849> you<00:03:48.940> been<00:03:49.090> watching<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
terms have you been watching all the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.729 
terms have you been watching all the
podcasts<00:03:49.810> where<00:03:50.260> we've<00:03:50.349> been<00:03:50.470> talking<00:03:50.680> about

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
podcasts where we've been talking about

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.379 
podcasts where we've been talking about
ISO<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.370> things<00:03:51.519> like<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.819> paper<00:03:52.090> has<00:03:52.359> a

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
ISO and things like that paper has a

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.470 
ISO and things like that paper has a
very<00:03:52.720> very<00:03:53.019> low<00:03:53.440> ISO<00:03:54.099> rating<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.299> can

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
very very low ISO rating and so it can

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.180 
very very low ISO rating and so it can
handle<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.900> safe<00:03:56.139> light<00:03:56.410> which<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:56.859> gives<00:03:57.040> you

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
handle a safe light which just gives you

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.710 
handle a safe light which just gives you
a<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.669> bit<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.790> light<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.180> work<00:03:58.329> with<00:03:58.569> in

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
a little bit of light to work with in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.390 
a little bit of light to work with in
the<00:03:58.840> darkroom<00:03:59.169> it's<00:03:59.440> not<00:03:59.590> bright<00:04:00.010> by<00:04:00.220> any

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the darkroom it's not bright by any

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.620 
the darkroom it's not bright by any
stretch<00:04:00.669> of<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> imagination<00:04:00.849> it's<00:04:01.480> usually

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
stretch of the imagination it's usually

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.559 
stretch of the imagination it's usually
yellow<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.109> red<00:04:02.760> anyway<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.209> this<00:04:04.480> right

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
yellow to red anyway this this right

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.229 
yellow to red anyway this this right
here<00:04:04.690> that's<00:04:04.959> awfully<00:04:05.380> dusty<00:04:05.769> is<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.940> cancer

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
here that's awfully dusty is the cancer

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.629 
here that's awfully dusty is the cancer
that<00:04:07.660> we're<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.139> use<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.680> develop<00:04:09.130> the

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
that we're going to use to develop the

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.979 
that we're going to use to develop the
film<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.329> I'm<00:04:10.450> gonna<00:04:10.540> show<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.750> how<00:04:10.840> this

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
film and I'm gonna show you how this

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.629 
film and I'm gonna show you how this
rolls<00:04:11.230> typically<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.099> I<00:04:12.190> said<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.489> need<00:04:12.609> to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
rolls typically like I said you need to

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.220 
rolls typically like I said you need to
be<00:04:12.819> in<00:04:12.910> complete<00:04:13.269> darkness<00:04:13.630> for<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.139> work

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
be in complete darkness for this to work

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.500 
be in complete darkness for this to work
correctly<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.519> like<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.819> use<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.970> changing

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
correctly and I like to use a changing

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.150 
correctly and I like to use a changing
bag<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.989> I'll<00:04:17.289> show<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.470> changing<00:04:17.919> bag<00:04:18.039> when

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
bag and I'll show you changing bag when

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.529 
bag and I'll show you changing bag when
we<00:04:18.250> actually<00:04:18.400> get<00:04:18.609> into<00:04:18.669> using<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.180> kit<00:04:19.389> but

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
we actually get into using the kit but

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.909 
we actually get into using the kit but
the<00:04:19.630> changing<00:04:19.989> bag<00:04:20.139> basically<00:04:20.530> looks<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.799> a

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
the changing bag basically looks like a

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.010 
the changing bag basically looks like a
windbreaker<00:04:21.459> with<00:04:21.579> no<00:04:21.910> head<00:04:22.330> or<00:04:22.360> sleeves<00:04:22.780> you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
windbreaker with no head or sleeves you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.390 
windbreaker with no head or sleeves you
put<00:04:23.169> your<00:04:23.349> arms<00:04:23.560> in<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.800> sleeves<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.310> it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
put your arms in the sleeves and it

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.219 
put your arms in the sleeves and it
gives<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.669> dark<00:04:24.880> area<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.630> roll<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:25.960> film

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
gives you a dark area to roll your film

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.930 
gives you a dark area to roll your film
up<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.740> you're<00:04:26.979> going<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.220> roll<00:04:27.490> your<00:04:27.610> film<00:04:27.849> up

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
up and you're going to roll your film up

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.300 
up and you're going to roll your film up
onto<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.300> spool<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:29.020> once<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.190> is

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
onto this spool and once it is

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.100 
onto this spool and once it is
completely<00:04:30.820> rolled<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.240> onto<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.539> spool<00:04:31.780> you

completely rolled up onto the spool you

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.469 
completely rolled up onto the spool you
put<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.650> here<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.610> closes<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.300> has<00:04:34.450> a

put it in here this closes and has a

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.060 
put it in here this closes and has a
light<00:04:34.780> trap<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.409> so<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.710> light<00:04:35.860> doesn't

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
light trap on it so the light doesn't

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.800 
light trap on it so the light doesn't
get<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.550> can<00:04:36.789> pour<00:04:37.000> chemicals<00:04:37.270> into<00:04:37.719> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
get in but I can pour chemicals into the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.719 
get in but I can pour chemicals into the
top<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.050> dump<00:04:38.380> them<00:04:38.500> out<00:04:38.620> okay<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.039> then<00:04:39.159> fine

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
top and dump them out okay and then fine

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.489 
top and dump them out okay and then fine
what<00:04:39.849> we<00:04:39.939> have<00:04:40.120> here<00:04:40.360> is<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.569> contact<00:04:41.050> printer

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:41.499 
what we have here is the contact printer

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.409 
what we have here is the contact printer
and<00:04:41.770> basically<00:04:42.129> this<00:04:42.279> is<00:04:42.339> a<00:04:42.460> metal<00:04:42.939> box<00:04:43.150> with<00:04:43.300> a

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
and basically this is a metal box with a

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.119 
and basically this is a metal box with a
light<00:04:43.659> socket<00:04:43.900> inside<00:04:44.409> and<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.770> plug<00:04:44.979> into

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
light socket inside and you plug into

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.769 
light socket inside and you plug into
the<00:04:45.279> wall<00:04:45.309> I<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:45.999> not<00:04:46.180> checked<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.599> see<00:04:46.659> if

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
the wall I have not checked to see if

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.469 
the wall I have not checked to see if
this<00:04:46.930> works<00:04:47.110> yet<00:04:47.379> but<00:04:47.620> hopefully<00:04:48.159> it<00:04:48.219> will

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
this works yet but hopefully it will

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.089 
this works yet but hopefully it will
there's<00:04:49.479> space<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.050> two<00:04:50.349> light<00:04:50.499> bulbs<00:04:50.770> inside

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
there's space for two light bulbs inside

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.619 
there's space for two light bulbs inside
and<00:04:51.490> what<00:04:51.879> you're<00:04:51.999> going<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.150> do<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.479> those

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629 
and what you're going to do is those

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.029 
and what you're going to do is those
light<00:04:52.839> bulbs<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.229> put<00:04:53.439> them<00:04:53.559> in<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:53.830> you're

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
light bulbs you put them in there you're

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.829 
light bulbs you put them in there you're
gonna<00:04:54.189> put<00:04:54.490> your<00:04:54.669> negative<00:04:55.120> over<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.599> paper

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
seconds something like that led to

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.850 
seconds something like that led to
experiment<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.240> times<00:05:13.479> your<00:05:14.199> paper<00:05:14.710> is

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
experiment the times your paper is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.799 
experiment the times your paper is
exposed<00:05:15.279> properly<00:05:15.819> under<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.270> negative<00:05:16.599> and

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:16.809 
exposed properly under the negative and

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.480 
exposed properly under the negative and
it's<00:05:17.259> time<00:05:17.469> to<00:05:17.649> pull<00:05:17.830> this<00:05:17.949> out<00:05:18.099> put<00:05:18.309> your

actually<00:05:31.659> doesn't<00:05:31.899> require<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.199> lot<00:05:32.289> of<00:05:32.409> stuff

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
actually doesn't require a lot of stuff

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.399 
actually doesn't require a lot of stuff
a<00:05:33.009> lot<00:05:33.249> of<00:05:33.460> space<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.089> it's<00:05:35.080> really<00:05:35.259> a<00:05:35.349> lot

a lot of space and it's really a lot

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.659 
a lot of space and it's really a lot
easier<00:05:35.770> than<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:35.979> think<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.249> lot<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.399> people

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669
