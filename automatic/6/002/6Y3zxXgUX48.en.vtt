00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.839
 in our universal language Esperanto 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.080

 now we are all bilingual 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.599
 a good photograph counts better a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.590
 history and a good art history 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590
 more interesting 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:53.829

 Photographic language is very particular 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.679

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.649
 report on photography what 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.909
 we found when observing them when they are 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.780
 photographed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.850
 with photographs of pitt 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.670

 do not 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 for this they trust more in some photographers 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:57.980
