period<00:00:08.639> i<00:00:08.849> think<00:00:09.150> i<00:00:09.240> put<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.750> day's<00:00:10.050> game

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
period i think i put in a day's game

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339 
period i think i put in a day's game
time<00:00:11.010> gameplay<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:12.990> people<00:00:13.110> might

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
time gameplay which some people might

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
time gameplay which some people might
say<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> lot<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.030> not<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
say is a lot but actually it's not that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.570 
say is a lot but actually it's not that
much<00:00:15.330> compared<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.990> many<00:00:16.920> other<00:00:17.010> people<00:00:17.520> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
much compared to many other people that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
much compared to many other people that
have<00:00:17.730> been<00:00:17.880> hauling<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.420> game<00:00:18.660> relentlessly

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
have been hauling this game relentlessly

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560 
have been hauling this game relentlessly
and<00:00:19.470> unlike<00:00:19.740> third<00:00:20.310> fourth<00:00:20.789> fifth<00:00:20.880> prestige

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and unlike third fourth fifth prestige

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.109 
and unlike third fourth fifth prestige
already<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.619> more<00:00:22.920> than<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.430> but

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
already probably more than that now but

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.650 
already probably more than that now but
um<00:00:24.300> i<00:00:24.630> haven't<00:00:25.109> really<00:00:25.320> made<00:00:25.470> many<00:00:25.740> videos

there was going to be an issue one of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.460 
there was going to be an issue one of
the<00:01:01.289> developers<00:01:01.859> said<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> video<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470

killstreaks were only available to the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
killstreaks were only available to the
sort<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.970> better<00:01:06.210> players<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
sort of better players and they want to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
sort of better players and they want to
change<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.799> anyone<00:01:08.159> could<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

I was a bit like hmm that doesn't sound
like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> good<00:01:11.939> idea<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:12.869> kill

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
like a good idea that's not what kill

and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.399> getting<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.850> kill<00:01:45.060> street<00:01:45.329> despite

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and then getting a kill street despite

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.830 
and then getting a kill street despite
dying<00:01:46.020> 40-times<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:48.360> doesn't<00:01:48.659> make<00:01:48.720> any

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
dying 40-times and that doesn't make any

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
dying 40-times and that doesn't make any
sense<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> main<00:01:49.920> issue<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.670> how

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sense but the main issue of that is how

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.810 
sense but the main issue of that is how
how<00:01:51.450> easy<00:01:51.780> UAV<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> obtainable<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:53.700> an

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
how easy UAV is obtainable and then an

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.910 
how easy UAV is obtainable and then an

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
massive impact on the game and these

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.499 
massive impact on the game and these
players<00:02:03.810> aren't<00:02:04.110> even<00:02:04.350> any<00:02:04.439> good<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.820> don't

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
players aren't even any good so I don't

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
players aren't even any good so I don't
I<00:02:06.780> can't<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:07.979> logic<00:02:08.670> behind<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.360> all

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
I can't see any logic behind that at all

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
I can't see any logic behind that at all
and<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.899> pretty<00:02:10.349> annoying<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.099> then<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and it's pretty annoying and then you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.949 
and it's pretty annoying and then you
just<00:02:11.879> sort<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.750> regular

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
just sort of have to look at the regular

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
just sort of have to look at the regular
kill<00:02:13.319> streaks

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
kill streaks

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
kill streaks
just<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.460> at<00:02:14.610> how<00:02:14.700> easier<00:02:15.150> UAV<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.900> gear

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
just look at how easier UAV is to gear

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.230 
just look at how easier UAV is to gear

catch it you need one more kill for your
UAV<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.880> far<00:02:24.570> too<00:02:24.600> easy<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
UAV and it's just it's far too easy to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.840 
UAV and it's just it's far too easy to
get<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.770> there's<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.190> much<00:02:26.340> killstreak

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
get that and there's so much killstreak

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.550 
get that and there's so much killstreak

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
spamming and there's they're relentless

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.310 
spamming and there's they're relentless
in<00:02:28.980> some<00:02:29.190> games<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.660> didn't<00:02:30.990> really<00:02:31.170> like

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
in some games so I didn't really like

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.540 
in some games so I didn't really like
the<00:02:31.410> kill<00:02:31.590> Street<00:02:31.830> spamming<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.370> modern

the kill Street spamming and modern
warfare<00:02:32.700> 2<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.660> become<00:02:34.230> more

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
warfare 2 and it's only become more

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.860 
warfare 2 and it's only become more
prevalent<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.160> game<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.540> pretty

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
prevalent in this game so that's pretty

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.900 
prevalent in this game so that's pretty
annoying<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.410> me<00:02:37.440> though<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.340> like<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
annoying for me though I really like the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.910 
annoying for me though I really like the
specialist<00:02:39.570> killstreaks<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:40.710> using

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
specialist killstreaks that I'm using

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.330 
specialist killstreaks that I'm using
here<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.490> just<00:02:41.730> wish<00:02:42.770> perhaps<00:02:43.770> there<00:02:44.070> was<00:02:44.130> some

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
here I just wish perhaps there was some

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.130 
here I just wish perhaps there was some
sort<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.580> juggernaut<00:02:45.150> perk<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.630> got<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:45.960> it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
sort of juggernaut perk you got with it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530 
sort of juggernaut perk you got with it
once<00:02:46.410> you've<00:02:46.590> got<00:02:46.800> all<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.250> because<00:02:47.610> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
once you've got all of them because you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.080 
once you've got all of them because you
know<00:02:48.690> yes<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.890> work<00:02:50.100> very<00:02:50.130> hard<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.880> all

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
know yes you work very hard to get all

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.120 
know yes you work very hard to get all
of<00:02:51.300> your<00:02:51.480> perks<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.590> what<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.830> gives<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
of your perks which is what it gives you

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.380 
of your perks which is what it gives you
and<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.760> die<00:02:54.000> pretty<00:02:54.300> much

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and then you just die pretty much

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.420 
and then you just die pretty much
instantly<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.830> pretty<00:02:55.980> lame<00:02:56.250> but

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
instantly which is pretty lame but

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.080 
instantly which is pretty lame but
whatever<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:58.130> moving<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.400> from<00:02:59.550> point<00:02:59.820> streets

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
whatever so moving on from point streets

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.430 
whatever so moving on from point streets
which<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.360> don't<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
which I don't really like in the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.830 
which I don't really like in the
slightest<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.580> next<00:03:02.820> issue<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.060> maps<00:03:03.480> and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
slightest the next issue is maps and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.060 
slightest the next issue is maps and
that<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.050> something<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> lot<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.950> people

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
that is something that a lot of people

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.450 
that is something that a lot of people
have<00:03:05.370> expressed<00:03:05.730> they<00:03:06.000> have<00:03:06.120> an<00:03:06.210> issue<00:03:06.330> with

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
it's not so much the colors and stuff I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.020 
it's not so much the colors and stuff I
mean<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.350> map<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.830> bit<00:03:11.070> dull<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.700> lifeless

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
mean this map is a bit dull and lifeless

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.960 
mean this map is a bit dull and lifeless
it's<00:03:12.960> more<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.130> size<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.850> the

it's more to do with the size of the

it's more to do with the size of the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.090 
maps and the layouts of the maps so this
map<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.410> probably<00:03:19.410> one<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.740> bigger<00:03:19.890> ones

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
map is probably one of the bigger ones

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.030 
map is probably one of the bigger ones
actually<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.730> it's<00:03:20.850> not<00:03:20.970> actually<00:03:21.270> very<00:03:21.480> big

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
actually but it's not actually very big

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
actually but it's not actually very big
and<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.060> case<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.420> most<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and that is the case with most of the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.260 
and that is the case with most of the
maps<00:03:25.050> they're<00:03:25.230> all<00:03:25.320> tiny<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
maps they're all tiny and you know you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.330 
maps they're all tiny and you know you
can<00:03:27.480> sort<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.870> spawn<00:03:28.200> walk<00:03:28.530> few<00:03:28.830> inches<00:03:29.010> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
can sort of spawn walk few inches and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.760 
can sort of spawn walk few inches and
then<00:03:29.400> you're<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.670> their<00:03:29.850> spawn<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.990> well

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
then you're in their spawn because well

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.160 
then you're in their spawn because well
this<00:03:32.160> one's<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.580> crap<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.150> also<00:03:33.600> because<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
this one's a crap but also because the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.120 
this one's a crap but also because the
maps<00:03:34.350> are<00:03:34.500> small<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:36.330> that's<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.620> small<00:03:37.920> maps

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
maps are small but that's the small maps

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
maps are small but that's the small maps
is<00:03:38.310> not<00:03:38.459> killer<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.910> think<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.330> killer<00:03:39.540> is

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
is not killer I think what the killer is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.449 
is not killer I think what the killer is
for<00:03:39.990> me<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.440> there<00:03:40.650> are<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.010> many<00:03:41.130> tight

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
for me is that there are so many tight

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.130 
for me is that there are so many tight
corners<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.390> sort<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.660> see<00:03:42.870> back

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
corners as you can sort of see back

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.380 
corners as you can sort of see back
there<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.800> was<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.490> room<00:03:44.700> where<00:03:45.030> there<00:03:45.330> were

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
there I I was in a room where there were

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.330 
there I I was in a room where there were
several<00:03:45.690> narrow<00:03:46.260> passageways<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.220> walk

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
several narrow passageways I can walk

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460 
several narrow passageways I can walk
down<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:47.820> eventually<00:03:47.990> lots<00:03:48.990> of<00:03:49.140> sort<00:03:49.410> of

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
down and eventually lots of sort of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.199 
down and eventually lots of sort of
blind<00:03:49.830> corners<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.550> well<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.880> eventually

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
blind corners as well and eventually

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.580 
blind corners as well and eventually
someone<00:03:51.480> was<00:03:51.690> around<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> corner<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.170> knife<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
someone was around the corner a knife to

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
someone was around the corner a knife to
me<00:03:52.709> as<00:03:52.860> has<00:03:53.459> happened<00:03:53.610> several<00:03:53.970> times<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.570> this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
me as has happened several times in this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.470 
me as has happened several times in this
game<00:03:54.840> play<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.290> it's<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:57.240> are<00:03:57.330> so

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
game play and it's just there are so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.940 
game play and it's just there are so
many<00:03:57.600> different<00:03:57.930> positions<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.650> can<00:03:58.770> die

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
many different positions you can die

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.830 
many different positions you can die
from<00:03:59.190> at<00:03:59.370> any<00:03:59.490> one<00:03:59.670> time<00:03:59.700> like<00:04:00.240> here<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.630> believe

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
from at any one time like here I believe

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.160 
from at any one time like here I believe
there's<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:02.730> archway<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.270> my<00:04:03.510> left<00:04:03.810> this

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
there's a the archway to my left this

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.960 
there's a the archway to my left this
little<00:04:04.530> room<00:04:04.650> are<00:04:04.800> going<00:04:05.010> into<00:04:05.130> now<00:04:05.400> behind<00:04:05.790> me

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
little room are going into now behind me

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.460 
little room are going into now behind me
there<00:04:06.180> are<00:04:06.270> two<00:04:06.390> ways<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.990> right<00:04:07.230> there

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
there are two ways to the right there

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.940 
there are two ways to the right there
were<00:04:07.560> several<00:04:07.800> ways<00:04:08.070> it's<00:04:08.840> def<00:04:09.840> sort<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.290> can

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
were several ways it's def sort of can

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.260 
were several ways it's def sort of can
come<00:04:11.160> from<00:04:11.340> anywhere<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:11.850> sort<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.060> takes

only so many places you can watch at one

time and considering there's you know

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.420 
time and considering there's you know
four<00:04:24.600> five<00:04:24.900> six<00:04:25.290> places<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.800> player<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.220> come

from at anyone
I'm<00:04:27.300> is<00:04:27.539> very<00:04:28.199> difficult<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.770> sort<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.190> account

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
I'm is very difficult to sort of account

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.870 
I'm is very difficult to sort of account
full<00:04:29.729> of<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:31.160> think<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.400> maps<00:04:32.610> were

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
full of that I think if the maps were

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.550 
full of that I think if the maps were
sort<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.240> they<00:04:33.630> they<00:04:33.840> just<00:04:34.050> need<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.199> be<00:04:34.289> less

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
sort of they they just need to be less

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.589 
sort of they they just need to be less
tight<00:04:34.860> there's<00:04:35.130> no<00:04:35.220> open<00:04:35.789> spaces<00:04:36.060> like<00:04:36.449> you

tight there's no open spaces like you

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.350 
tight there's no open spaces like you
saw<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> wasteland<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.710> derail<00:04:38.130> not<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.210> own

open<00:04:39.720> space<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.139> fantastic<00:04:40.800> because<00:04:40.949> if<00:04:41.160> you

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
open space is fantastic because if you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.070

there's just there's no variety in the

an<00:05:23.280> issue<00:05:23.430> in<00:05:23.669> my<00:05:23.789> opinion<00:05:24.060> many<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.659> people's

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
an issue in my opinion many of people's

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.540 
an issue in my opinion many of people's
opinion<00:05:25.470> but<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:26.009> annoying<00:05:26.250> thing<00:05:26.490> about

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
opinion but the annoying thing about

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.249 
opinion but the annoying thing about
that<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:26.940> they're<00:05:27.630> never<00:05:27.780> going<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.050> change

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
that is they're never going to change

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.159 
that is they're never going to change
because<00:05:28.620> obviously<00:05:29.190> they're<00:05:29.729> gonna<00:05:29.849> spam<00:05:30.509> dlc

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
because obviously they're gonna spam dlc

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.110 
because obviously they're gonna spam dlc

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
been very very poor most of the maps and

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.300 
been very very poor most of the maps and
you<00:05:39.810> have<00:05:39.930> to<00:05:40.020> look<00:05:40.139> at<00:05:40.229> things<00:05:40.470> like<00:05:40.560> carnival

you have to look at things like carnival
salvage<00:05:41.940> trailer<00:05:42.389> park<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.020> just<00:05:43.199> think<00:05:43.440> oh

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
salvage trailer park and just think oh

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320

yeah I don't think that's ever gonna be
fixed<00:05:49.650> but<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.460> main<00:05:50.729> killer<00:05:51.180> for<00:05:51.449> me<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.870> that

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
fixed but the main killer for me is that

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.890 
fixed but the main killer for me is that
this<00:05:52.380> game<00:05:52.650> has<00:05:52.680> become<00:05:53.159> rather<00:05:53.370> stale<00:05:53.940> boring

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
this game has become rather stale boring

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.680 
this game has become rather stale boring
repetitive<00:05:55.849> I've<00:05:56.849> been<00:05:57.000> playing<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.360> series

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
repetitive I've been playing the series

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.749 
repetitive I've been playing the series

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.469 
of duty for nothing much has changed has
been<00:06:02.009> minor<00:06:02.250> changes<00:06:02.820> but<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.090> way<00:06:03.150> the<00:06:03.300> game

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
been minor changes but the way the game

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.899 
been minor changes but the way the game
plays<00:06:03.509> hasn't<00:06:04.469> changed<00:06:04.949> significant<00:06:05.490> amounts

plays hasn't changed significant amounts

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.879 
plays hasn't changed significant amounts
and<00:06:06.030> then<00:06:06.630> modern<00:06:06.930> warfare<00:06:07.050> 2<00:06:07.409> compared<00:06:07.800> to

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
and then modern warfare 2 compared to

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.680 
and then modern warfare 2 compared to
modern<00:06:08.009> warfare<00:06:08.130> 3<00:06:08.400> is<00:06:08.699> literally<00:06:09.120> like<00:06:09.300> the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
modern warfare 3 is literally like the

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.350 
modern warfare 3 is literally like the
same<00:06:09.900> game<00:06:10.169> so<00:06:10.880> having<00:06:11.880> played<00:06:12.150> modern

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
same game so having played modern

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.120 
same game so having played modern
warfare<00:06:12.570> two<00:06:12.900> for<00:06:12.930> roughly<00:06:13.830> two<00:06:14.099> years

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
warfare two for roughly two years

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.070 
warfare two for roughly two years
because<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.789> didn't<00:06:15.030> like<00:06:15.150> black<00:06:15.419> ops<00:06:15.630> much<00:06:15.840> or

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
because I didn't like black ops much or

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.580 
because I didn't like black ops much or
play<00:06:16.110> at<00:06:16.469> much<00:06:17.000> it's<00:06:18.000> quite<00:06:18.570> difficult<00:06:19.199> to

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
play at much it's quite difficult to

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.399 
play at much it's quite difficult to
play<00:06:19.889> this<00:06:20.099> game<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.759> it's<00:06:21.120> just<00:06:21.419> it<00:06:22.199> feels

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
play this game and it's just it feels

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.570 
play this game and it's just it feels
like<00:06:22.620> there's<00:06:22.860> no<00:06:22.919> need<00:06:23.250> for<00:06:23.280> them<00:06:23.550> to

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
like there's no need for them to

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.920 
like there's no need for them to
innovate<00:06:24.030> anymore<00:06:24.389> because<00:06:24.599> they<00:06:24.690> know<00:06:24.900> they

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
innovate anymore because they know they

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.330 
innovate anymore because they know they
can<00:06:25.199> get<00:06:25.320> sales<00:06:25.650> on<00:06:25.919> what<00:06:26.039> they've<00:06:26.159> got

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
can get sales on what they've got

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.770 
can get sales on what they've got
they've<00:06:26.520> got<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.699> working<00:06:26.909> formula<00:06:27.330> that's

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
they've got a working formula that's

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.480 
they've got a working formula that's
going<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:27.990> repeatedly<00:06:28.530> outsell<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.340> game

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
going to repeatedly outsell the game

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.189 
going to repeatedly outsell the game

change what ain't broke so there's no

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.730 
change what ain't broke so there's no
real<00:06:36.180> need<00:06:36.419> for<00:06:36.479> them<00:06:36.750> to<00:06:36.779> innovate<00:06:37.409> and<00:06:37.560> adds

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
real need for them to innovate and adds

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.370 
real need for them to innovate and adds
huge<00:06:38.370> amazing<00:06:38.669> new<00:06:39.270> features<00:06:39.539> that<00:06:39.839> people

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
huge amazing new features that people

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.940 
huge amazing new features that people
may<00:06:40.560> not

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
may not

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.310 
may not
like<00:06:41.070> and<00:06:41.390> you<00:06:42.390> know<00:06:42.510> I<00:06:42.540> can<00:06:42.810> understand<00:06:43.200> that

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
like and you know I can understand that

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.070 
like and you know I can understand that
but<00:06:43.440> at<00:06:43.710> the<00:06:43.830> same<00:06:44.010> time<00:06:44.250> it's<00:06:45.240> boring<00:06:45.810> me<00:06:46.050> and

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
but at the same time it's boring me and

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.430 
but at the same time it's boring me and
it's<00:06:46.920> not<00:06:47.220> hugely<00:06:47.880> appealing<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.540> play<00:06:48.780> so<00:06:49.200> I

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
it's not hugely appealing to play so I

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.500 
it's not hugely appealing to play so I
can't<00:06:50.430> say<00:06:50.670> that<00:06:50.700> I'm<00:06:50.850> going<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:51.000> play<00:06:51.150> a<00:06:51.180> huge

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
can't say that I'm going to play a huge

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.080 
can't say that I'm going to play a huge
amount<00:06:51.840> but<00:06:52.050> uh<00:06:52.550> we'll<00:06:53.550> have<00:06:53.670> to<00:06:53.790> wait<00:06:53.880> and<00:06:53.940> see

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
amount but uh we'll have to wait and see

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.850 
amount but uh we'll have to wait and see
so<00:06:54.660> this<00:06:54.900> is<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:55.080> end<00:06:55.200> of<00:06:55.260> the<00:06:55.320> gameplay<00:06:55.680> not

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
so this is the end of the gameplay not

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.590 
so this is the end of the gameplay not
particularly<00:06:56.220> good<00:06:56.280> it's<00:06:56.640> quite<00:06:57.090> tough<00:06:57.330> I

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
particularly good it's quite tough I

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.240 
particularly good it's quite tough I
find<00:06:57.870> it<00:06:57.990> quite<00:06:58.050> tough<00:06:58.350> to<00:06:58.530> get<00:06:58.650> low<00:06:58.920> def

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
find it quite tough to get low def

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.000 
find it quite tough to get low def
gameplays<00:06:59.760> but<00:07:00.090> uh<00:07:00.120> 30<00:07:00.930> or<00:07:01.110> seven<00:07:01.350> is<00:07:01.590> the<00:07:01.740> best

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
gameplays but uh 30 or seven is the best

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.880 
gameplays but uh 30 or seven is the best
I<00:07:02.220> managed<00:07:02.550> to<00:07:02.580> get<00:07:03.210> and<00:07:03.530> yeah<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.740> pretty

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
I managed to get and yeah that pretty

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.610 
I managed to get and yeah that pretty
much<00:07:05.010> sums<00:07:05.160> up<00:07:05.550> that<00:07:05.840> maybe<00:07:06.840> there'll<00:07:07.080> be<00:07:07.110> more

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
much sums up that maybe there'll be more

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.430 
much sums up that maybe there'll be more
gameplay<00:07:08.070> issues<00:07:08.610> eventually<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:09.390> uh<00:07:09.450> yeah

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
gameplay issues eventually but uh yeah

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.050 
gameplay issues eventually but uh yeah
that's<00:07:10.620> what<00:07:10.800> I<00:07:10.860> think<00:07:11.070> that<00:07:11.190> now<00:07:11.370> so<00:07:11.700> thanks
