00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.200

 zelda majora's mask the damn cartridge of the good as before 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.160
 but first I want to send a greeting to all the most efficient countries that 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.750
 visit the channel of zarco country 111 that exists now if you know the history 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.550
 begins when they give him a nintendo 64 the boy wanted to buy games of 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.420
 second hand in a garage sale you meet an old man 0 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.219
 describe it as one-eyed eye 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.379
 limped and so on 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.949
 the guy in the story was looking for game 64 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.559
 the old man, almost desperate and enthusiastic, comes out with a nintendo 64 cartridge 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.539
 spent and without the label but want to improve the excited and happy type 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.539
 he asked how much the old man said he gave it to him that belonged to 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.170
 a boy of his age who no longer lived here he did not enter his 64 but he had 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 a name with file called ben he got to play he noticed that he was pretty 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.969
 advance and almost at the end a tab called link was created as tradition but 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.069
 he noticed that the game was still calling him, the stranger after a while erased the 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.159
 game called ben but the game did not call us link 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.159
 but he left a space he was surprised and followed the game then to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.360
 fight against escura kid appeared a floating skull that talked with him 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.750
 I told him destiny tulio is bad etcetera etcetera this corpse 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.090
 I interacted with him 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 at the moment of touching the ocarina or doing anything the character dies 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.530
 burned you try to do anything and you die burned together in the background you hear 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 a macabre laugh and the lullaby and kuin upside down melted in terror what 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.650
 turns off and decides to go back to where the old man who sold it to him the neighbors told him 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
 that this old man appears from time to time and the boy asks who he was 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.580
 The neighbors tell him that it was a boy who suffered an accident. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.230
 time ago the boy since then did not play again anymore 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.300
 majora's mask because of the fear that the same thing will happen 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.310
 good knowing the legend will happen to deny with my partner peru 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
 let's start first, I'm not 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.989
 bux everywhere daughter of a saber jáquez 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.019
 in the story it says that bing started doing spasms that he had never done and 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.329
 that was completely unusual 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.329
 but let's compare a ship 64 thread of history 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:32.379
 I see he did it exactly on the rally of v1 if time is not a pattern it's like that 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.919
 as mistakes with which you can configure the stupidity you want 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.019
 wherever you want and when you want look here there is a zelda arq I hope it is 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.619
 how to teleport to the place it is put anywhere thanks to errors 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.659
 that throws the game by putting certain code patterns for example the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.059
 duty from one instant to another fossil 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:55.129
 the set up did everything was burned in the video the floor all of the video example 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:02.419
 the code to be completely alone is 0x0 40 acts 0x0 403 you do not enter 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.249
 the configuration part of the renegade emulator 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.889
 now it's my turn hello bystander I'm the bighead but where there's a lot of art 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.189

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.509
 damned cartridge 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.779

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.739

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.669

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:36.039
 garage or they were given them and that after their experience with the game they never 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.309
 they saw Caesar again, it's chance 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:44.749
 I asked him for a video game he brought me just a game of 64 god what 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.069
