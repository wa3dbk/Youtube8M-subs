00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.170
 pretty cool technique I find who is going 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 allow you to steer so all 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.119
 stores where you can not take out your 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.359
 of one with your car and dover 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.499
 to open the door then 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.510
 that's why your car should not 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.960
 to be very big is that you have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.519
 in referred by above the seller with 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.870
 a weapon with silencer preferably 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.829
 because last time without 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.429
 silent I immediately had a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.889

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.949

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:04.110
 sure to kill in one go after 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 so you go out they'll score 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.840
 German if it works and so if he is 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.700
 good dead know they that the store 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 is closed and so there you enjoy it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.820
 to enter and you shoot at them 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 crates because it's not like in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.610
 the fuel pumps where he can take 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 direct money you can shoot the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 checkout once or twice with a pump 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 for knew faster for that money 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.620
 so are basically that's it allows you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.720
 to point out all the little shops that 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.090
 you are not supposed to be able to point 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.490
 there you can turn them so it's 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.350

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.080
 silent crane pump on the stuff 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.970

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.450

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.500
