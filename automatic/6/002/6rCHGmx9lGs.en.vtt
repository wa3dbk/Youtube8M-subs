or spinning reel this is the SL 30 pts
the<00:00:15.450> second<00:00:15.839> size<00:00:16.049> up<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.590> they<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the second size up you know they make it

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.660

25<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.670> 30<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.690> 40<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> 50<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> 30

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
25 a 30 a 40 to 50 so this is the 30

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570 
25 a 30 a 40 to 50 so this is the 30
that's<00:00:21.630> very<00:00:21.869> similar<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> 25<00:00:22.859> looks<00:00:23.430> like

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that's very similar to the 25 looks like

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.910 
that's very similar to the 25 looks like
just<00:00:23.760> has<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> deeper<00:00:24.240> cut<00:00:24.390> spool<00:00:24.689> body<00:00:25.590> looks

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
just has a deeper cut spool body looks

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
just has a deeper cut spool body looks
looks<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> same<00:00:26.930> really<00:00:27.930> nice<00:00:28.080> real

you<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> goal<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.310> reels<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you know the goal of these reels was to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
you know the goal of these reels was to
create<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> saltwater<00:00:31.349> inshore<00:00:32.070> reel<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.550> was

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
create a saltwater inshore reel that was

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.630 
create a saltwater inshore reel that was
really<00:00:33.059> light<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> extremely<00:00:35.250> light

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
really light and this is extremely light

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
really light and this is extremely light
and<00:00:35.670> only<00:00:35.969> seven<00:00:36.300> point<00:00:36.690> nine<00:00:36.750> ounces<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.469> can

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and only seven point nine ounces you can

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
and only seven point nine ounces you can
see<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:39.030> removed<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> lot<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.660> material

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
see that they removed a lot of material

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
see that they removed a lot of material
from<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> handle<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.719> from

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
from the handle over there and also from

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.270 
from the handle over there and also from
this<00:00:42.870> part<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.320> handle<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.920> drilled<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this part of the handle they drilled a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
this part of the handle they drilled a
lot<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.700> openings<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.500> right
