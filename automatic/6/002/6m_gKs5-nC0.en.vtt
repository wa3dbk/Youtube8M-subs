with<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.129> like<00:02:45.579> when<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:46.030> you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
with that is like when you when you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.819 
with that is like when you when you
fight<00:02:46.329> like<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.510> scion<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.230> example<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.739> it's

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
fight like a scion for example and it's

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.710 
fight like a scion for example and it's
been<00:02:47.950> taken<00:02:48.370> its<00:02:48.489> its<00:02:48.760> behaviour<00:02:49.209> completely

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
been taken its its behaviour completely

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.089 
been taken its its behaviour completely
change<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.319> really<00:02:50.440> defies<00:02:50.799> what<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
change so it really defies what you

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.099 
change so it really defies what you
expect<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.030> enemy<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.629> tweaks<00:02:52.989> the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
expect that enemy it really tweaks the

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.559 
expect that enemy it really tweaks the
