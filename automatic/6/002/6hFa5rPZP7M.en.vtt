00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.820
 hello hello to everybody guys and 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.890
 good girls in this second part we're going 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.490
 to see the missing components 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.910
 to finish our low cost pc 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.579
 then as you see here I have four 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.390
 things that I have ordered as is a disk 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.949
 32 gb solid state hard drive 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 the cheapest ones you found worth 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.789
 then we have a keyboard 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 very very cheap gaming and that the truth 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.740
 that seems to be pretty enough 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.240
 all right 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.070
 on the other hand a graph hd 6770 in the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.290
 version d 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.230
 or it's worth 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.950
 and this graphic actually I've 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 changed by the 66 70 that came out in the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.480
 first part because for a little more I've 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.670
 seen that it had a lot more performance 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.250
 and in the end I have opted for this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.440
 last here we have a 600 source 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.030
 watts okay then let's throw this 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.309
 aside 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.010
 and we are going to start seeing then the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.960
 keyboard for example vale 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.960
 good as you see in this keyboard 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.200
 has consul 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.200
 quito 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.780
 it's good with cable because I prefer 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.070
 keyboards and mice with wires 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.600
 because then I never run out of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 batteries and I do not have to be dizzy 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 good as you see has the keys used 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 for color gaming then it has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 several multifunction keys around here to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.440
 sound to and back to back 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 in this part it's also worth it and then it has 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.869
 a light that from what I 've seen in 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.280
 videos and such is green here that by the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.440
 night lights up and it's pretty 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.940
 pretty cool 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.380
 good 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 let's leave this here 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.959
 on the other hand the good graph as you see 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.380
 the box is this and if we open it what 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.380
 carry inside 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.100
 well then we must here a 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.770
 booklet with some instruction some 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.520
 advertising imagine the disc where they will go 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.520
 the drivers 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.560
 manual 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.800
 then we have here the cable for the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.870
 feed that goes from 4 pins to 6 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.550
 pins feed the card since 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.880
 I needed external power we have 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.770
 a converter 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 dvi vga 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.120
 Well here is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.220
 is double slot as you can see and imagine 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.849
 the dissipation will be quite enough 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.849
 decent 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.110
 well let's continue with more here 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.110
 we have it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.170
 As you can see, it is the same size as 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.170
 a disc of two and a half of the normals 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.390
 it's sata 2 it seems to me 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.000
 and 32gb good actually will then be 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.350
 about 30 gb but that this what is going to 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.620
 do is that when we have the system 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.450
 operative on this disk the computer us 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.070
 it's going to start and it's going to work 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.210
 pretty pretty faster we're going to 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.040
 treat the difference quite 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.930
 and then finally good because we have 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.650
 here a power supply very very 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.930
 cheap 600 watts since for that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.510
 graphic card because we require a 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.110
 good senior source comes with its cable 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.110
 feeding 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.190
 yes yes a sachet with the screws for 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.700
 attach it to the box or tower 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.860
 computer 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.880
 and good and then here we have the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.220
 weather 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.220
 600 watt simple 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.560
 with 12 x 12 fan 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.940
 and consumption 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:24.060
 Well, this has been everything and see you 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.600
 in the next video that will be of the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.600
 mounting
