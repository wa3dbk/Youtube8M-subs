way

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.240 
and but yeah that's basically what we're
going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.319> literally<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:13.740> got<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> do

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
going to do so literally all got to do

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.550 
going to do so literally all got to do
and<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:15.150> takes<00:02:15.390> literally<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.080> minute<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and it takes literally a minute and a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.290 
and it takes literally a minute and a
half

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
half

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.860 
half
not<00:02:18.300> even<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:20.970> about<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.360> quarter<00:02:21.600> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
not even that and I'm about a quarter of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.050 
not even that and I'm about a quarter of
an<00:02:21.990> inch<00:02:22.080> or<00:02:22.319> about<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> centimeter<00:02:24.800> away<00:02:29.060> you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
an inch or about a centimeter away you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.080 
an inch or about a centimeter away you
might<00:02:30.209> need<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> do<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> couple<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.230> passes<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
might need to do a couple of passes and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.660 
might need to do a couple of passes and
it<00:02:33.510> literally<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:35.090> crinkles<00:02:36.090> up

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.360 

I<00:02:39.140> mean<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.770> soldiering<00:02:41.190> Hina

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I mean this is but this soldiering Hina

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220 
I mean this is but this soldiering Hina
might<00:02:41.610> say<00:02:41.850> has<00:02:42.000> been<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.330> for<00:02:42.540> about<00:02:42.630> two

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
might say has been on for about two

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
might say has been on for about two
hours<00:02:43.260> or<00:02:43.740> something<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.490> incredibly

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
hours or something so it is incredibly

00:02:45.300 --> 00:03:01.800 
hours or something so it is incredibly
hot<00:02:45.890> very<00:02:46.890> hot<00:02:51.740> okay

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.980 

and<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.650> actually<00:03:02.800> see<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> top

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
and you can actually see just on the top

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.280 
and you can actually see just on the top
of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> F<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:07.150> starting<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.750> deform<00:03:08.110> a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
of the F it's starting to deform a

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:20.720 
of the F it's starting to deform a
little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:13.560> there<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:14.740> go<00:03:18.270> let's<00:03:19.270> do<00:03:19.450> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
little bit there we go let's do the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.340 
little bit there we go let's do the
original<00:03:21.730> cottony<00:03:22.150> body<00:03:27.330> like<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.360> said<00:03:28.750> it's

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
original cottony body like I said it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.900 
original cottony body like I said it's
up<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.860> I'm<00:03:30.130> going<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.370> go<00:03:30.520> for<00:03:30.700> quite<00:03:30.790> a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
up to you I'm going to go for quite a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.850 
up to you I'm going to go for quite a
ratty<00:03:31.180> look<00:03:31.420> but<00:03:31.959> I'm<00:03:32.080> going<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.290> exaggerate

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
ratty look but I'm going to exaggerate

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.540 
ratty look but I'm going to exaggerate
it<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.520> see<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.160> does<00:03:36.370> if

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
it so you can see it what this does if

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.009 
it so you can see it what this does if
you<00:03:36.670> do<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.940> little<00:03:37.120> bit<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.570> starts<00:03:37.930> to

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
you do it a little bit it starts to

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.630 
you do it a little bit it starts to
crack<00:03:38.290> around<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.800> lacquer<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.280> stuff<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
crack around the lacquer and stuff and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.850 
crack around the lacquer and stuff and
starts<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.090> lift<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:41.410> that's<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.739> you'll

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
starts to lift and that's what you'll

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.290 
starts to lift and that's what you'll
tend<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.190> find<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.550> all<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> guitars<00:03:43.120> with

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
tend to find on all the guitars with

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.810 
tend to find on all the guitars with
transfers<00:03:43.720> like<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.489> I'm<00:03:45.489> going<00:03:45.760> to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
transfers like that I'm going to

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.580 
transfers like that I'm going to
exaggerate<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.480> be<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.230> said<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.440> don't

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
exaggerate it be like I said I don't

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.520 
exaggerate it be like I said I don't
really<00:03:47.800> care<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:50.350> know<00:03:50.410> just

really care this is just you know just
for<00:03:51.010> demonstration<00:03:51.670> purposes<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.360> if<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.319> did

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
for demonstration purposes and if I did

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.050 
for demonstration purposes and if I did
it<00:03:53.530> subtly<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.250> wouldn't<00:03:54.519> be<00:03:54.580> able<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.819> see

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
it subtly you wouldn't be able to see

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.559 
it subtly you wouldn't be able to see
all<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.569> but<00:03:56.260> you'll<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.769> mean

can<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.590> bit<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:39.669> relic<00:04:40.680> what<00:04:41.680> you'll<00:04:41.830> tend

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
can do a bit of a relic what you'll tend

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.590 
can do a bit of a relic what you'll tend
to<00:04:42.160> find<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.550> around<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:42.940> machine<00:04:43.180> had<00:04:43.390> holes

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
to find is around the machine had holes

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.010 
to find is around the machine had holes
they<00:04:44.140> tend<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> crack<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.970> know<00:04:46.120> now<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.690> can

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
they tend to crack you know now you can

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.230 
they tend to crack you know now you can
either<00:04:47.140> you're<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.680> need<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.880> ferrule

either you're going to need the ferrule

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.980 
either you're going to need the ferrule
you're<00:04:49.840> going<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:51.180> for<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.300> just<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.840> get

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
you're going to use for this just to get

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.800 
you're going to use for this just to get
you<00:04:53.080> an<00:04:53.229> idea<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> you're<00:04:55.180> going<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.360> pop<00:04:55.539> it<00:04:55.720> in

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
you an idea so you're going to pop it in

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.790 
you an idea so you're going to pop it in
the<00:04:55.930> hole<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:58.479> what<00:04:58.870> you'll<00:04:59.020> tend<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.289> find<00:04:59.380> is

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
the hole and what you'll tend to find is

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.510 
the hole and what you'll tend to find is
cracks<00:05:00.340> in<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:01.060> lacquer<00:05:01.350> around<00:05:02.350> here<00:05:02.620> and

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
cracks in the lacquer around here and

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.340 
cracks in the lacquer around here and
around<00:05:03.700> here<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.330> stuff<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.960> that's<00:05:05.050> just

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
around here and stuff and that's just

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.050 
around here and stuff and that's just
where<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.650> machine<00:05:06.010> head<00:05:06.220> moves<00:05:06.430> back<00:05:06.850> and

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
where the machine head moves back and

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.250 
where the machine head moves back and
forward<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:09.130> do<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.539> get<00:05:10.690> that

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
forward so to do that and to get that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.400 
forward so to do that and to get that
you<00:05:13.260> can<00:05:13.500> just<00:05:13.740> put<00:05:14.240> get<00:05:15.240> your<00:05:15.450> craft<00:05:15.720> your

out you know give it a few meaningful
dings<00:06:12.000> around<00:06:12.450> here<00:06:14.540> wow<00:06:15.540> that<00:06:15.780> was<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.900> bit

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
dings around here wow that was a bit

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.510 
dings around here wow that was a bit
more<00:06:16.230> of<00:06:16.290> a<00:06:16.410> meaningful<00:06:16.740> thing<00:06:16.890> liniment<00:06:17.310> too

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
more of a meaningful thing liniment too

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.600 
more of a meaningful thing liniment too
but<00:06:18.270> anyway<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.930> get<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.140> idea<00:06:19.290> also<00:06:20.250> what

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
but anyway you get the idea also what

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.830 
but anyway you get the idea also what
you<00:06:20.700> can<00:06:20.730> do<00:06:21.090> is<00:06:21.180> if<00:06:21.300> you<00:06:21.330> want<00:06:21.420> to<00:06:21.570> get<00:06:21.720> the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
you can do is if you want to get the

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.690 
you can do is if you want to get the
actual<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.380> natural<00:06:22.860> effects<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.340> doing<00:06:23.460> that

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
actual a natural effects of doing that

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.490 
actual a natural effects of doing that
is<00:06:23.910> once<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:24.450> put<00:06:24.480> your<00:06:24.750> machine<00:06:25.050> head<00:06:25.230> back

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
is once you put your machine head back

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.390 
is once you put your machine head back
on<00:06:25.680> again<00:06:26.990> pop<00:06:27.990> them<00:06:28.170> in<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.530> then<00:06:28.620> tighten

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
on again pop them in and then tighten

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.010 
on again pop them in and then tighten
them<00:06:29.640> down<00:06:29.850> pretty<00:06:30.090> tight<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.630> that<00:06:30.810> will

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
them down pretty tight and that will

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.540 
them down pretty tight and that will
actually<00:06:31.200> push<00:06:31.620> those<00:06:31.860> in<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.190> start<00:06:32.400> to

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
actually push those in and start to

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.490
