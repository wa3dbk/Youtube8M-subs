00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
have to do that within my blinkfeed Zoe

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
have to do that within my blinkfeed Zoe
does<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.160> few<00:01:26.310> different<00:01:26.430> things<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.750> takes

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
does a few different things so it takes

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.170 
does a few different things so it takes
both<00:01:28.229> high<00:01:28.500> definition<00:01:28.950> video<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.550> some

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
both high definition video and some

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
both high definition video and some
still<00:01:30.390> frames<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.160> impact

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
still frames in there so what impact

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.140 
still frames in there so what impact
does<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.060> press<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.750> shutter<00:01:34.170> button<00:01:34.320> now

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
does I press the shutter button now

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
does I press the shutter button now
you'll<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> got<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> red<00:01:37.040> red<00:01:38.040> line<00:01:38.070> over

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you'll see I got a red red line over

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.400 
you'll see I got a red red line over
there<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.690> it's<00:01:39.900> much<00:01:40.050> better<00:01:40.229> when

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
there so actually it's much better when

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.109

change that over two different ones and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.590 
change that over two different ones and
and<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.400> gives<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.790> option<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.450> it's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
and it gives you the option because it's

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.750 
and it gives you the option because it's
taking<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:20.960> video<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> lot<00:02:22.730> of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
taking that video to do a lot of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.460 
taking that video to do a lot of
different<00:02:22.850> things<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.870> example<00:02:23.930> with<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
different things so for example with the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.920 
different things so for example with the
sequence<00:02:24.890> shot<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.210> go<00:02:26.450> into<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.750> actual

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
sequence shot if I go into the actual

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.780 
sequence shot if I go into the actual
moments<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.590> that's<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.490> Zoe

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
moments of it that's the that's the Zoe

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.880 
moments of it that's the that's the Zoe
moment<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.450> taken<00:02:29.900> originally<00:02:30.350> for<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
video so then I can go through it and I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.170 
video so then I can go through it and I
can<00:02:33.740> go<00:02:34.340> through<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.700> different<00:02:34.790> flavor

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
can go through the different flavor

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.330 
can go through the different flavor
frames<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.900> see<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.770> different<00:02:37.040> frames<00:02:37.190> that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
frames and see the different frames that

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
frames and see the different frames that
were<00:02:37.430> taken<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:38.450> also<00:02:38.750> lets<00:02:38.900> me<00:02:38.990> go<00:02:39.290> into<00:02:40.190> edit

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
were taken it also lets me go into edit

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.530 
were taken it also lets me go into edit
go<00:02:42.620> into<00:02:42.860> retouch<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.640> then<00:02:44.030> do<00:02:44.210> all<00:02:44.390> these

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
go into retouch and then do all these

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.880 
go into retouch and then do all these
other<00:02:44.750> things<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.080> things<00:02:45.230> like<00:02:45.410> sequence

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
other things so things like sequence

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.980 
other things so things like sequence
shot<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.640> will<00:02:46.790> automatically<00:02:47.300> process<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
shot it will automatically process the
