00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.100
 the smoke between my lungs filled with 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.920
 sensations a life of black colors 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.470
 no tastes bastards with sodium I do not want 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.810
 the podium your god wants this folio is the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.970
 role of bad actors to stay 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.490
 a shot at esther pizarro I like the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 jar with the tail the palate knows me to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.350
 mud I run through my subconscious and it's a 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.530
 wasteful thanks to a live joint in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.260
 the grapevine is a total miracle and touch the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.750
 Heaven's limit was her hair and for God 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.299
 my fingers tremble, the world kills me and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.030
 limits jealousy I do not have a button and I am 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.739
 a myth I just love you kills me 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.199
 more than the course the circumstance the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.260
 swallow it and it still hurts me the most 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.170
 to tell my intellect are those days 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.390
 I have the company of the smoke and there will be 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.790
 take advantage of it and we saw it alone in a 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.830
 corner of my mind turning my back on 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 passed while I answer the present 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.990
 I feel that he does not feel I look into his eyes 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.110
 death the right time and place 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 coherently hopefully it's like smoke the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.310
 rumor of the leaves that wet the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.430
 very same 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.189
 the purest of one's soul is having breakfast 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.950
 fasts in a timely manner the pure and 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.289
 it went like a fish that drags the tide 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.229
 like the idea of ​​love in a man 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.189
 in love I do not give or stick my eyes suffer 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.820
 gonorrhea I do not sell one I give it 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.950
 give me give me strength to fight or blessed 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 Rap moves me away from good and evil 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.179
 give me the secret of pure life not to say 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.520
 nothing will only give clues to those who 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.069
 really deserve the monotony of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.140
 time plays with my program I do not want 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.659
 fame I want to sadam every day more 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.209
 writing the pain praying because it 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.600
 it will end is not over always fight for 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.610
 continue looking at the wall with the soul 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 I was cold I love those who must 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 write you someday cry 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.630
 what's the use if your kisses are like that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.000
 others your look if you have prayed and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.340
 crying because everything is the same 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.980
 could go better but everything can go to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.440
 bad renting my mind to live in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.260
 peace tried to take away the dreams that I did not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.180
 I'm going to achieve a smoke contract and 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.209
 of step to be so with the heart 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.520
 closed and the window open but to me 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.970
 ink pen half dead I want 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.050
 continue but knock on the door you give 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.410
 mind that I work at home 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 you do not like being interrupted when 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.050
 you are more and posing in your garden quoted 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.680
 in fact it took away from them feeling on the phone 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.730
 and sometimes I put a cast away yo 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.670
 I work at all hours so I never 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 never interrupt me in agreement or 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.810
 even if there is a fire even if 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.150
 you hear a thud in my house that at 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.770
 after a week a pain comes out of here 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.680
 that can only be that of a corpse 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.600
 rotten and already take a handkerchief to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.690
 the face because the stench is so strong 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.080
 that you are going to earthquake there still not 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.470
 call here as if it's the night of the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.480
 choices and you're excited and you want 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.130
 celebrate it because some shower already with 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.530
 the one that you leave has been chosen the first 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.819
 president fagot and has decided that you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.829
 is going to lead to doing crazy things before 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:37.799
 if you want someone to share 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:43.240
 that time still do not call this 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:47.340
 under no circumstances 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.340
 you have agreed to it
