dovetails<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:12.689> motor<00:01:12.990> mount

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
dovetails that the this motor mount

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.950 
dovetails that the this motor mount
rides<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> adjust<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
rides on and you adjust it with this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.330 
rides on and you adjust it with this
hand<00:01:16.229> wheel<00:01:17.720> which<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.920> which<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:19.950> pretty<00:01:20.220> cool

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
hand wheel which is which is pretty cool

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.630 
hand wheel which is which is pretty cool
step<00:01:23.340> Ollie's<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:26.570> quite<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
step Ollie's so you got quite a bit of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:39.870 
step Ollie's so you got quite a bit of
adjustment<00:01:31.490> yeah<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.759> go

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:49.389 

the<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.979> screws<00:01:46.369> are<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:47.119> bit<00:01:47.420> worn<00:01:47.659> but<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:49.009> mean

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
the the screws are a bit worn but I mean

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.450 
the the screws are a bit worn but I mean
not<00:01:49.549> too<00:01:49.700> bad<00:01:53.770> they're<00:01:54.770> not<00:01:54.799> they're<00:01:55.310> not

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
not too bad they're not they're not

not too bad they're not they're not
terrible

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
terrible

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.080 
terrible
overall<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> machine<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.700> pretty<00:01:59.030> good

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
overall the machine is in pretty good

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.960 
overall the machine is in pretty good
shape

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.470 

I<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.610> static<00:02:15.610> phase<00:02:15.910> converter<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.570> it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
I have a static phase converter on it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.200 
I have a static phase converter on it
the<00:02:19.480> previous<00:02:19.690> owner<00:02:20.110> put<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:27.210> it's

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
the previous owner put that in and it's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.210 
the previous owner put that in and it's
kind<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> tight<00:02:28.690> fit<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:29.050> here<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:33.100> an

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
kind of a tight fit right here it's an

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.170 
kind of a tight fit right here it's an
Anderson<00:02:35.310> Anderson<00:02:36.310> converter<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.820> works<00:02:40.000> all

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
Anderson Anderson converter it works all

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
Anderson Anderson converter it works all
right

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
right

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.800 
right
the<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.180> motors<00:02:43.480> run<00:02:43.660> kind<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> rough<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
the the motors run kind of rough and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.340 
the the motors run kind of rough and
occasionally<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.110> feed<00:02:47.920> motor<00:02:48.160> will<00:02:49.350> will

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
occasionally the feed motor will will

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.600 
occasionally the feed motor will will
trip<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:52.120> motor<00:02:52.510> starter<00:02:55.980> I'm<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.160> exactly

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
trip the motor starter I'm not exactly

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
trip the motor starter I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:57.820> why<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:58.510> if<00:02:59.380> if<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.550> wired<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:01.030> 440

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
sure why but if if it is wired to 440

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.970 
sure why but if if it is wired to 440
and<00:03:02.380> I'm<00:03:02.500> trying<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.860> run<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.130> on<00:03:03.190> 220<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:04.740> on<00:03:05.740> a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
and I'm trying to run it on 220 and on a

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.010 
and I'm trying to run it on 220 and on a
phase<00:03:06.250> converter<00:03:06.670> at<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.060> static<00:03:07.840> phase

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
phase converter at that static phase

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.730 
phase converter at that static phase
converter<00:03:08.350> then<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:09.610> might<00:03:09.790> make<00:03:09.970> sense<00:03:10.740> as

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
converter then that might make sense as

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.640 
converter then that might make sense as
to<00:03:11.920> why<00:03:12.130> it's<00:03:12.630> that's<00:03:13.630> why<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:13.989> tripping<00:03:14.380> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.940 

you<00:03:17.650> know<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.830> heads<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:20.260> pretty<00:03:20.500> cool<00:03:20.709> I've

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
you know the heads it's pretty cool I've

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.560 
you know the heads it's pretty cool I've
seen<00:03:21.130> different<00:03:21.250> styles<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:22.000> heads<00:03:22.239> on<00:03:22.450> these

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
seen different styles of heads on these

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.759 
seen different styles of heads on these
eight<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> half<00:03:22.930> these<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:28.769> this

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
eight and a half these this one is this

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.990 
eight and a half these this one is this
is<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> non<00:03:31.709> power<00:03:32.709> down<00:03:33.269> power<00:03:34.269> down<00:03:34.480> feed

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is a non power down power down feed

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.970 
is a non power down power down feed
although<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.540> seems<00:03:38.019> like<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.890> would

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
although it seems like you you would

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.380 
although it seems like you you would
have<00:03:40.260> you'd<00:03:41.260> be<00:03:41.410> able<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:43.030> make<00:03:43.209> that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
have you'd be able to you make that

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.479 
have you'd be able to you make that
happen<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.549> had<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.950> if<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.040> had<00:03:48.220> an<00:03:48.340> old

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
happen if I had the if I had an old

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.270 
happen if I had the if I had an old
machine<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.090> thought<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.959> could<00:03:50.970> cannibalize

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
machine that thought I could cannibalize

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.320 
machine that thought I could cannibalize
but<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.590> on<00:03:56.680> these<00:03:56.860> two<00:03:57.700> by<00:03:57.850> fours<00:03:58.150> down

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
but I got it on these two by fours down

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.500 
but I got it on these two by fours down
there<00:03:58.570> because<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:00.610> gives<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.940> bit<00:04:01.090> bit

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
there because it's it gives it a bit bit

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.590 
there because it's it gives it a bit bit
more<00:04:01.690> height<00:04:01.900> which<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.650> nice<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:06.570> yeah<00:04:07.570> I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
more height which is nice and yeah I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.789 
more height which is nice and yeah I
guess<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.989> could<00:04:08.370> show<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:11.380> static

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
guess I could show you that the static

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:23.610 
guess I could show you that the static
feed<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.880> way<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.180> works<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.980> am

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400 

wait<00:04:24.190> for<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.580> spin<00:04:24.820> up

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.980 

and<00:04:28.410> off<00:04:28.680> she<00:04:28.830> goes

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
and off she goes

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.550 
and off she goes
and<00:04:30.990> once<00:04:31.290> that's<00:04:31.470> running<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.980> can<00:04:33.320> put<00:04:34.320> on<00:04:34.410> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
and once that's running I can put on the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.850 
and once that's running I can put on the
feed<00:04:34.710> motor

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.589

so yeah that Jen I don't really know
what<00:05:15.080> I'm<00:05:15.169> doing<00:05:15.199> here<00:05:15.710> but<00:05:16.040> I've<00:05:17.000> got<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:18.520> scrap

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
what I'm doing here but I've got a scrap

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.040 
what I'm doing here but I've got a scrap
piece<00:05:19.669> of<00:05:19.880> aluminum<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.509> was<00:05:20.690> trying<00:05:20.870> to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
piece of aluminum that I was trying to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.719 
piece of aluminum that I was trying to
face<00:05:21.550> didn't<00:05:22.550> do<00:05:22.610> such<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> good<00:05:23.000> job<00:05:23.150> on<00:05:23.509> it

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
face didn't do such a good job on it

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.090 
face didn't do such a good job on it
mainly<00:05:25.729> because<00:05:25.880> of<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.419> clamping<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.830> spots

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
mainly because of the clamping the spots

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.170 
mainly because of the clamping the spots
where<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.340> actually<00:05:28.460> had<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.759> clamped<00:05:29.150> down

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
where I actually had it clamped down

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.689 
where I actually had it clamped down
it's<00:05:29.600> it's<00:05:29.930> really<00:05:30.169> nice<00:05:30.350> but

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
it's it's really nice but

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.700 
it's it's really nice but
didn't<00:05:33.090> really<00:05:33.270> do<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.840> best<00:05:34.169> job<00:05:34.530> at<00:05:34.680> that

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
didn't really do the best job at that

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:43.740 
didn't really do the best job at that
I'm<00:05:35.069> still<00:05:35.310> learning<00:05:35.870> so<00:05:36.870> that's<00:05:37.469> that

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.300 

that<00:05:44.380> runs<00:05:44.620> well<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:44.920> love<00:05:45.310> this<00:05:45.490> machine

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310

number<00:06:11.780> nine<00:06:11.930> taper<00:06:12.700> could<00:06:13.700> have<00:06:13.850> converted

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
number nine taper could have converted

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.470 
number nine taper could have converted
it<00:06:14.630> to<00:06:14.690> r8<00:06:15.170> but<00:06:15.440> decided<00:06:16.010> just<00:06:16.040> to<00:06:16.310> stick<00:06:17.300> with

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
it to r8 but decided just to stick with

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.570 
it to r8 but decided just to stick with
the<00:06:17.720> brown<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.380> sharp<00:06:18.650> you<00:06:18.920> can<00:06:18.950> find<00:06:19.250> tool<00:06:19.430> in

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
the brown and sharp you can find tool in

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.370 
the brown and sharp you can find tool in
for<00:06:19.820> him

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
for him

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.500 
for him
and<00:06:22.630> that's<00:06:23.630> that<00:06:23.930> oh<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:25.580> guess<00:06:25.850> I<00:06:26.030> could<00:06:26.210> I

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
and that's that oh I guess I could I

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.230 
and that's that oh I guess I could I
could<00:06:26.750> add<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:27.170> in<00:06:27.500> order<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:28.060> move<00:06:29.060> the

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
could add that in order to move the

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.660 
could add that in order to move the
machine<00:06:30.340> I<00:06:31.340> actually<00:06:32.180> removed<00:06:32.720> the<00:06:32.990> head<00:06:33.670> you

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
machine I actually removed the head you

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.990 
machine I actually removed the head you
can<00:06:34.700> see<00:06:34.850> that<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.470> dovetail<00:06:36.640> you<00:06:37.640> can<00:06:37.820> run

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
can see that the dovetail you can run

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.630 
can see that the dovetail you can run
that<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.390> head<00:06:38.540> straight<00:06:38.960> off<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:40.430> end<00:06:40.550> of

that the head straight off the end of

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.800 
that the head straight off the end of
the<00:06:40.700> machine<00:06:41.030> it's<00:06:41.660> all<00:06:41.810> adjustable<00:06:43.510> the<00:06:44.510> head

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
the machine it's all adjustable the head

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.660 
the machine it's all adjustable the head
is<00:06:44.930> adjustable<00:06:45.440> you<00:06:45.530> can<00:06:45.620> you<00:06:45.920> can<00:06:46.040> push<00:06:46.550> it

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
is adjustable you can you can push it

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.940 
is adjustable you can you can push it
out<00:06:46.760> or<00:06:46.940> bring<00:06:47.060> it<00:06:47.180> back<00:06:47.330> in<00:06:47.570> but<00:06:47.810> in<00:06:48.470> order<00:06:48.740> to

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
out or bring it back in but in order to

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.070 
out or bring it back in but in order to
to<00:06:49.580> move<00:06:49.730> the<00:06:49.940> machine<00:06:50.270> I<00:06:50.300> was<00:06:50.570> just<00:06:50.750> using<00:06:50.990> a

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
to move the machine I was just using a

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.690 
to move the machine I was just using a
very<00:06:51.230> small<00:06:51.350> trailer<00:06:52.540> so<00:06:53.540> you<00:06:53.600> just<00:06:54.610> loosen<00:06:55.610> up

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
very small trailer so you just loosen up

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.050 
very small trailer so you just loosen up
a<00:06:55.940> couple<00:06:56.210> screws<00:06:56.560> at<00:06:57.560> the<00:06:57.650> bottom<00:06:58.100> and<00:06:58.340> then

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
a couple screws at the bottom and then

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.740 
a couple screws at the bottom and then
crank<00:06:59.360> this<00:06:59.630> pinion<00:07:01.270> loosen<00:07:02.270> up<00:07:02.390> the<00:07:02.480> screws

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
crank this pinion loosen up the screws

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.480 
crank this pinion loosen up the screws
all<00:07:02.960> the<00:07:02.990> way<00:07:03.140> actually<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:03.980> then<00:07:04.130> you<00:07:04.250> kind

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
all the way actually and then you kind

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.320 
all the way actually and then you kind
of<00:07:04.550> have<00:07:04.640> to<00:07:05.050> bump<00:07:06.050> the<00:07:06.560> head<00:07:06.980> over<00:07:07.490> top<00:07:07.910> of<00:07:07.940> the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
of have to bump the head over top of the

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.990 
of have to bump the head over top of the
end<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:09.650> pinion<00:07:10.160> gear<00:07:10.190> has<00:07:10.520> to<00:07:10.670> basically

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
end the pinion gear has to basically

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
end the pinion gear has to basically
bump<00:07:11.570> over<00:07:11.840> top<00:07:12.260> of<00:07:12.560> the<00:07:12.770> end<00:07:12.950> of<00:07:13.280> the<00:07:13.780> of<00:07:14.780> the

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
bump over top of the end of the of the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.580 
bump over top of the end of the of the
rack<00:07:15.940> and<00:07:16.940> that<00:07:17.510> threw<00:07:18.230> me<00:07:18.260> for<00:07:18.380> a<00:07:18.530> loop

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
rack and that threw me for a loop

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.730 
rack and that threw me for a loop
because<00:07:18.920> I<00:07:19.040> didn't<00:07:19.370> I<00:07:19.550> couldn't<00:07:19.850> find

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
because I didn't I couldn't find

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.320 
because I didn't I couldn't find
schematics<00:07:21.740> to<00:07:22.370> figure<00:07:22.610> out<00:07:22.700> what<00:07:22.880> was<00:07:23.060> under

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
schematics to figure out what was under

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.360 
schematics to figure out what was under
there<00:07:23.450> and<00:07:23.690> I<00:07:23.720> was<00:07:23.840> trying<00:07:23.990> to<00:07:24.230> figure<00:07:25.190> it<00:07:25.220> out

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
there and I was trying to figure it out

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.800 
there and I was trying to figure it out
by<00:07:25.490> feel<00:07:27.430> but<00:07:28.430> once<00:07:28.730> once<00:07:29.150> we<00:07:29.300> had<00:07:29.420> that<00:07:29.630> you

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:29.810 
by feel but once once we had that you

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.210 
by feel but once once we had that you
know<00:07:29.870> we<00:07:30.050> were<00:07:30.140> just<00:07:30.320> able<00:07:30.440> to<00:07:30.590> just<00:07:30.680> slide<00:07:30.920> it

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.220 
know we were just able to just slide it

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.520 
know we were just able to just slide it
all<00:07:31.340> the<00:07:31.370> way<00:07:31.640> off<00:07:31.910> and<00:07:32.540> support<00:07:33.260> it<00:07:33.350> and<00:07:33.410> that

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530 
all the way off and support it and that

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.380 
all the way off and support it and that
made<00:07:33.680> it<00:07:33.710> the<00:07:33.860> that<00:07:34.610> made<00:07:34.760> the<00:07:34.880> machine<00:07:35.150> a<00:07:35.180> lot

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.390 
made it the that made the machine a lot

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.360 
made it the that made the machine a lot
more<00:07:35.570> manageable<00:07:35.780> to<00:07:36.200> move<00:07:38.920> yeah<00:07:39.920> just<00:07:40.190> let<00:07:40.310> me

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
more manageable to move yeah just let me

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.650 
more manageable to move yeah just let me
know<00:07:40.550> if<00:07:40.640> you<00:07:40.730> have<00:07:40.820> any<00:07:40.940> questions<00:07:41.390> or<00:07:41.540> want
