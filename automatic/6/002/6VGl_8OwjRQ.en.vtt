00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:12.050
 effects let's try to create an effect 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.180

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:30.549
 millisecond let's try to take 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:35.080

 Effect 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:09.280
 for example, decrease the opposite and lose 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:13.359
 okay as you can see we are approaching 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.940
 on the next slide we will try 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:22.810
 swap the beginning and end that is 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.810
 will be the next effect 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:34.850
 on the contrary it was big then it becomes 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:38.530
 small and on the next slide we 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.530
 change the beginning and end 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:48.729

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:16.850
