00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 and today I got home I went to see a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 video use here let's know in the videos is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 play black gaucho but it 's the xbox live 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.730
 that is downloading to be 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 updated is taking so far before 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.789
 to play a little record logo vision 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 To send today, I have already told you 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.079
 I spent the year already going on more on vacation 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.589
 so it 's in the crowd because the hulk is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.350
 green question not so pertinent 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 how much is it because the super heroes 14 in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 up the pants 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 But I believe it's a question. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.820
 cool to bring here to the channel and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.060
 I'll tell you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.630
 First is so highlights It's just going to me. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.630
 we have a shock hub 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 then average actually the hulk turns green 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 because when he is he thought of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 character initially thought of the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.880
 character with gray coloring but is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 started there always gives me the zaga that I had 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 some tones that came out lighter 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.220
 others darker and yet some 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.789
 left - green and when neither was 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.250
 see the outcome of the war who if he 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.440
 saw in some hulk comics and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.330
 greenish and with that he preferred the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.910
 hulk in its color since it adopted the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.299
 our marvel of marvel with color 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.110
 green and until today he is green 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.290
 however there are some of those who stay there 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.940
 gray that it is changing but are 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.100
 official color of today until 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.250
 formerly taking away that thought 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.239
 to make it clear was that the hulk 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.040
 be pretend but until today what is green 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.489
 because the impressions that were coming out 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.769
 greenish medium and install so preferred 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.450
 So that's it folks, it's hoped that you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.140
 thought the video leave in comments 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.359
