00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
design memory craft long so I'm also

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.959 
design memory craft long so I'm also
going<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:45.530> be<00:00:45.649> changing<00:00:46.070> up<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.370> surface<00:00:46.820> i'm

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
going to be changing up the surface i'm

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.660 
going to be changing up the surface i'm
working<00:00:47.329> on<00:00:47.449> me<00:00:48.019> working<00:00:48.409> on<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.860> more<00:00:49.100> textural

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
working on me working on a more textural

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.020 
working on me working on a more textural
board<00:00:50.300> that<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.050> made<00:00:51.320> for<00:00:51.649> pastels<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.550> I've

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
board that is made for pastels and I've

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.540 
board that is made for pastels and I've
already<00:00:53.329> got<00:00:53.690> one<00:00:54.050> set<00:00:54.409> up<00:00:54.530> here<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:55.399> going

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
already got one set up here so I'm going

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.160 
already got one set up here so I'm going
to<00:00:55.610> show<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:55.879> how<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.180> can<00:00:56.390> embellish<00:00:56.780> your

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
to show you how you can embellish your

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.930 
to show you how you can embellish your
work<00:00:57.440> by<00:00:57.739> using<00:00:57.979> the<00:00:58.190> pastel<00:00:58.699> pencil<00:00:59.239> and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
work by using the pastel pencil and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.719 
work by using the pastel pencil and
because<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.239> board<00:01:02.629> has<00:01:02.930> grit<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:04.009> grips<00:01:04.550> the

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
because this board has grit it grips the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.380 
because this board has grit it grips the
pastel<00:01:05.420> pencil<00:01:06.020> quite<00:01:06.890> well<00:01:07.399> and<00:01:07.670> you'll<00:01:08.210> know

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
pastel pencil quite well and you'll know

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.029 
pastel pencil quite well and you'll know
when<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.630> work<00:01:08.869> on<00:01:09.050> paper<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.679> might<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:10.009> a

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
when you work on paper it might be a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.139 
when you work on paper it might be a
more<00:01:10.340> dull<00:01:11.289> line<00:01:12.289> but<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.190> really<00:01:13.640> makes<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
more dull line but this really makes the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.020 
more dull line but this really makes the
product<00:01:14.450> shine<00:01:15.130> they're<00:01:16.130> really<00:01:16.399> easy<00:01:16.429> to<00:01:16.789> use

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
product shine they're really easy to use

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.279 
product shine they're really easy to use
and<00:01:17.210> they're<00:01:17.330> going<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.479> have<00:01:17.660> that<00:01:17.780> textural

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
and they're going to have that textural

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.859 
and they're going to have that textural
surface<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.280> kind<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.090> smooth<00:01:20.479> then

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
surface so you can kind of smooth then

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.249 
surface so you can kind of smooth then
just<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.500> little<00:01:21.530> bit<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.850> get<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.330> slightly

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
just a little bit to get that slightly

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.550 
just a little bit to get that slightly
painterly<00:01:25.039> look<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.479> just<00:01:27.289> kind<00:01:27.440> of

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
painterly look and then just kind of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:40.220 
painterly look and then just kind of
draw<00:01:27.860> with<00:01:28.130> them<00:01:28.310> as<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.490> wish

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.980 

now<00:01:40.800> because<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.430> pastel<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.300> a<00:01:42.360> pencil

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
now because this pastel is in a pencil

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.770 
now because this pastel is in a pencil
it's<00:01:43.440> going<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> bolder<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.880> precise

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it's going to get a bolder more precise

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's going to get a bolder more precise
line<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.730> that<00:01:47.910> line

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
line so I just want to take that line

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.120 
line so I just want to take that line
and<00:01:48.570> blend<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> matches<00:01:49.830> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and blend it in so it matches the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
and blend it in so it matches the
background<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.940> have<00:01:51.150> behind<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.980> it's<00:01:52.980> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
background that I have behind it it's a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.740 
background that I have behind it it's a
nice<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.580> soft<00:01:53.940> bit<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.330> color

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.600 

and<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.380> will<00:01:59.470> blend<00:01:59.680> with<00:01:59.860> any<00:02:00.040> pastel

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
and it will blend with any pastel

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:13.080 
and it will blend with any pastel
product<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.180> work<00:02:01.390> with

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 

you
