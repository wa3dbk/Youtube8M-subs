00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.600 
ready to hit a bull's eye not bad but
Matt<00:01:46.229> thinks<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.100> getting<00:01:47.369> used

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Matt thinks this would take getting used

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
Matt thinks this would take getting used
to<00:01:47.759> he's<00:01:48.390> used<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> leaning<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.320> shooting

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to he's used to leaning in and shooting

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
to he's used to leaning in and shooting
it's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.490> cool<00:01:50.700> option<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.350> being

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's a very cool option I mean being

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's a very cool option I mean being
able<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> film<00:01:52.890> yourself<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.520> pretty

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
able to film yourself it's pretty

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
able to film yourself it's pretty
difficult<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.799> makes<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
difficult and with this it makes it a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
difficult and with this it makes it a
lot<00:01:56.340> easier<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.689> something

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
lot easier I think it's just something

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.600 
lot easier I think it's just something
that<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> practice<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.340> lot

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that I would want to practice with a lot

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
that I would want to practice with a lot
before<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.450> took<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> could<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.890> used

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
before I took it out so I could get used

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.200 
before I took it out so I could get used
to<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> totally<00:02:03.180> different

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.690 
accountable yeah what my timing more
closely<00:03:03.019> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.290> exactly<00:03:04.220> Jim<00:03:04.459> can<00:03:04.609> you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
closely in the exactly Jim can you

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.150 
closely in the exactly Jim can you
believe<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.940> hit<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> target<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.799> target

believe I hit the target right on target
there<00:03:07.549> looks<00:03:07.819> good<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:08.060> guess<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.480> scope<00:03:08.720> works

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
there looks good I guess the scope works

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.290 
there looks good I guess the scope works
pretty<00:03:09.170> well
