about a 28 inch wingspan I think 19
ounces<00:00:13.310> I've<00:00:13.820> got<00:00:14.030> a<00:00:14.060> microchip<00:00:14.570> version<00:00:15.019> 3<00:00:15.320> on

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
ounces I've got a microchip version 3 on

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.859 
ounces I've got a microchip version 3 on
there<00:00:15.769> which<00:00:16.730> is<00:00:16.939> what<00:00:17.119> I<00:00:17.150> had<00:00:17.390> on<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.689> version

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
there which is what I had on the version

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.079 
there which is what I had on the version
2<00:00:18.320> plane<00:00:18.619> and<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.890> wasn't<00:00:19.220> fast<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:19.759> it<00:00:19.880> flew

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
2 plane and it wasn't fast but it flew

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.259 
2 plane and it wasn't fast but it flew
just<00:00:20.269> fine<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:21.070> decided<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.189> go<00:00:22.310> only<00:00:22.699> L<00:00:22.880> Evans

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
just fine I decided to go only L Evans

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
on this as opposed to the V tail so I

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.460 
on this as opposed to the V tail so I
don't<00:00:25.579> have<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:25.880> V<00:00:26.029> tails<00:00:26.300> yet<00:00:26.659> but<00:00:27.050> may<00:00:27.230> add

this<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.500> little<00:00:39.769> launching<00:00:40.280> handle<00:00:40.670> that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
this is a little launching handle that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.669 
this is a little launching handle that
dave<00:00:41.030> was<00:00:41.210> talking<00:00:41.629> about<00:00:41.840> on<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.140> forum<00:00:42.500> so

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
dave was talking about on the forum so

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.610 
dave was talking about on the forum so
you<00:00:42.769> can<00:00:42.949> grab<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:43.250> launched<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.420> out<00:00:44.620> straight

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
you can grab it launched it out straight

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.169 
you can grab it launched it out straight
like<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:46.010> as<00:00:46.250> opposed<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.789> doing<00:00:46.969> the

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
like this as opposed to doing the

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.020 
like this as opposed to doing the
sidesaddle<00:00:47.690> which<00:00:47.960> i<00:00:48.079> used<00:00:48.289> to<00:00:48.469> do<00:00:48.879> from<00:00:49.879> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
sidesaddle which i used to do from the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.689 
sidesaddle which i used to do from the
side<00:00:50.269> here<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.870> old<00:00:51.019> plane<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.699> dave

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
side here with the old plane and dave

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.959 
side here with the old plane and dave
assures<00:00:53.120> us<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.129> there's<00:00:55.129> no<00:00:55.429> risk<00:00:55.670> of

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
assures us that there's no risk of

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.970 
assures us that there's no risk of
hitting<00:00:56.420> your<00:00:56.660> hand<00:00:56.899> on<00:00:57.019> that<00:00:57.170> Prop<00:00:57.499> so<00:00:57.800> we'll

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
hitting your hand on that Prop so we'll

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.220 
hitting your hand on that Prop so we'll
see<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.280> works<00:00:58.489> out<00:00:58.910> I'm<00:00:59.660> sure<00:01:00.050> he's

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
see how that works out I'm sure he's

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.130 
see how that works out I'm sure he's
right<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:01.339> have<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.699> little<00:01:01.879> magnet<00:01:02.480> here<00:01:02.749> on<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
right I have a little magnet here on the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.310 
right I have a little magnet here on the
hatch<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.859> keep<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.420> shut<00:01:05.420> although<00:01:05.900> I'm<00:01:06.050> have

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
hatch to keep it shut although I'm have

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.840 
hatch to keep it shut although I'm have
a<00:01:06.350> feeling<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.980> suction<00:01:07.370> from<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.640> prop

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
a feeling that the suction from the prop

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.180 
a feeling that the suction from the prop
will<00:01:08.030> probably<00:01:08.360> keep<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.600> shut<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:09.980> let's

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
will probably keep that shut so let's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.450 
will probably keep that shut so let's
see<00:01:10.310> how<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.460> does<00:01:10.720> I've<00:01:11.720> got<00:01:12.380> full<00:01:12.710> throws<00:01:13.070> but

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
see how it does I've got full throws but

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.540 
see how it does I've got full throws but
fifty<00:01:13.850> percent<00:01:14.210> expo<00:01:14.690> on<00:01:14.720> here

hey all right here it goes very easy to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
hey all right here it goes very easy to
launch<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.630> opposed<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.230> sidesaddle<00:01:36.860> nice

let's try a loop
Oh<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:53.400> lot<00:01:54.390> easier<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.840> loop<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.470> diversion

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
Oh a lot easier to loop than diversion

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
saying you know dave was saying

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.350 
saying you know dave was saying
something<00:03:44.800> about<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.550> way<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.850> elephant's

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
something about the way the elephant's

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.600 
something about the way the elephant's
are<00:03:46.569> angled<00:03:47.020> on<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.350> claim<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.430> know

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
are angled on this claim and I I know

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.309 
are angled on this claim and I I know
what<00:03:51.880> he's<00:03:51.970> saying<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.480> way<00:03:52.600> they're<00:03:52.840> angled

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
what he's saying the way they're angled

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.980 
what he's saying the way they're angled
you<00:03:54.250> don't<00:03:54.490> get<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.790> scrub<00:03:55.120> off<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.570> speed

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
you don't get the scrub off of speed

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.840 
you don't get the scrub off of speed
like<00:03:56.290> with<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> last<00:03:56.830> plane<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.280> last<00:03:57.490> plane

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
like with the last plane the last plane

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.880 
like with the last plane the last plane
the<00:03:58.350> elephant's<00:03:59.350> were<00:03:59.590> very<00:04:00.120> straight<00:04:01.890> these

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
the elephant's were very straight these

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.050 
the elephant's were very straight these
are<00:04:03.160> angled<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.030> they<00:04:04.570> bleed<00:04:04.959> off<00:04:05.140> less<00:04:05.440> speed

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
are angled so they bleed off less speed

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.559 
are angled so they bleed off less speed
and<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.819> in<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.060> loops<00:04:10.300> the

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
and you can see that in the loops the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.600 
and you can see that in the loops the
version<00:04:11.140> 2<00:04:11.320> plane<00:04:11.590> used<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:11.980> go<00:04:12.130> up<00:04:12.160> into<00:04:12.489> a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
version 2 plane used to go up into a

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.140 
version 2 plane used to go up into a
loop<00:04:12.820> install<00:04:13.300> right<00:04:13.600> about<00:04:13.900> there<00:04:15.150> because

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
loop install right about there because

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.819 
loop install right about there because
it<00:04:16.299> would<00:04:16.450> scrub<00:04:16.780> off<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.200> much<00:04:17.380> speed<00:04:17.620> with

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
it would scrub off so much speed with

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.190 
it would scrub off so much speed with
those<00:04:18.010> elephants<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.540> plane<00:04:19.810> does<00:04:20.019> not

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
those elephants and this plane does not

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.520 
those elephants and this plane does not
do<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.709> it's<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.609> totally<00:04:22.210> different<00:04:22.530> f-117

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
do that it's a totally different f-117

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.790 
do that it's a totally different f-117
than<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> version<00:04:24.430> 2<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:24.880> gotta<00:04:25.210> say<00:04:25.480> that<00:04:25.800> look

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
than the version 2 I gotta say that look

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.940 
than the version 2 I gotta say that look
at<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:26.980> speed<00:04:27.340> with<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.730> microjet

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.600 

those<00:04:37.950> squirrely<00:04:38.520> with<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.730> tail<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.240> there

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
those squirrely with the tail in there

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.760 
those squirrely with the tail in there
this<00:04:41.610> doesn't<00:04:41.880> have<00:04:42.120> thrust<00:04:42.450> vectoring<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.290> it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
this doesn't have thrust vectoring so it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.670 
this doesn't have thrust vectoring so it
does<00:04:43.980> get<00:04:44.190> hit<00:04:44.400> by<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> tailwind<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.680> we'll

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
does get hit by a tailwind and we'll

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:58.760 
does get hit by a tailwind and we'll
need<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.890> little<00:04:47.160> bit<00:04:47.310> more<00:04:47.550> control

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.309 

little<00:04:59.460> high<00:04:59.610> alpha<00:04:59.849> action<00:05:00.509> there<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.900> b2

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
little high alpha action there the b2

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.900 
little high alpha action there the b2
was<00:05:01.560> pretty<00:05:01.800> good<00:05:02.009> at<00:05:02.160> high<00:05:02.340> outfit<00:05:02.789> would

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
was pretty good at high outfit would

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.570 
was pretty good at high outfit would
start<00:05:03.210> wagging<00:05:03.389> its<00:05:03.690> wings<00:05:04.069> once<00:05:05.069> it<00:05:05.250> got<00:05:05.400> to

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
start wagging its wings once it got to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.470 
start wagging its wings once it got to
the<00:05:05.699> limit

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.310 

and<00:05:12.630> like<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.320> dave<00:05:13.920> says<00:05:14.310> in<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:15.450> video

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.410 

when<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.440> plane<00:05:19.680> stalls<00:05:20.100> this<00:05:20.700> plane<00:05:21.030> stalls

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
when the plane stalls this plane stalls

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.380 
when the plane stalls this plane stalls
nose<00:05:22.170> down<00:05:22.610> meaning<00:05:23.610> you've<00:05:23.880> got<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> lot<00:05:24.360> of

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
nose down meaning you've got a lot of

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.410 
nose down meaning you've got a lot of
control<00:05:28.520> rather<00:05:29.520> than<00:05:29.790> having<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.240> wing

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
control rather than having the wing

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.630 
control rather than having the wing
stall<00:05:30.810> on<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.110> tips<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.740> nose<00:05:31.980> stalls<00:05:32.370> and

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
stall on the tips the nose stalls and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.130 
stall on the tips the nose stalls and
then<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.850> nose<00:05:33.030> drops<00:05:33.390> then<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:33.900> gain

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
then the nose drops then you gain

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.780 
then the nose drops then you gain
momentum<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.890> you<00:05:34.950> can<00:05:35.130> recover<00:05:35.520> very

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
momentum and you can recover very

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.840 
momentum and you can recover very
quickly<00:05:36.440> given<00:05:37.440> enough<00:05:38.070> altitude<00:05:40.820> what<00:05:41.820> a

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
quickly given enough altitude what a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.220 
quickly given enough altitude what a
nice<00:05:42.090> slow<00:05:42.390> flyer<00:05:47.390> what<00:05:48.390> a<00:05:48.420> beautiful<00:05:48.780> looking

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
nice slow flyer what a beautiful looking

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.170 
nice slow flyer what a beautiful looking
plane<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.680> definitely<00:05:50.160> is<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> nicest<00:05:51.030> looking

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
plane it definitely is a nicest looking

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:04.450 
plane it definitely is a nicest looking
plane

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.040 

nice<00:06:05.870> very<00:06:06.870> nice<00:06:08.090> one<00:06:09.090> thing<00:06:09.270> we<00:06:09.390> could<00:06:09.630> use<00:06:09.810> is

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
nice very nice one thing we could use is

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.370 
nice very nice one thing we could use is
