the bolts out lowered the rear end down

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.729 
the bolts out lowered the rear end down
actually<00:00:32.540> blocked<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:34.940> underneath

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
actually blocked it up underneath

you just have to be careful when doing
that<00:00:52.800> there's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.530> couple<00:00:55.530> lines<00:00:55.920> throughout

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
that there's a couple lines throughout

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.010 
that there's a couple lines throughout
they're<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:59.180> flexible<00:01:00.180> enough<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> allow<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
they're all flexible enough to allow it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
they're all flexible enough to allow it
to<00:01:01.289> drop<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> drop<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to drop you just don't want to drop it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.210 
to drop you just don't want to drop it
too<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.799> dropped<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
too much as you see we just dropped it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.320 
too much as you see we just dropped it
enough<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> bolts

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
enough to be able to get to the bolts

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.830 
enough to be able to get to the bolts
I'll<00:01:09.330> show<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:09.990> side<00:01:11.840> we

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
I'll show you on the other side we

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.880 
I'll show you on the other side we
obviously<00:01:13.020> took<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> wheels<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
obviously took the wheels off this is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.530 
obviously took the wheels off this is
the<00:01:17.009> machine<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> an<00:01:19.740> 89<00:01:21.020> case<00:01:22.020> 5<00:01:22.470> ATK

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
the machine here it's an 89 case 5 ATK

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.719 
the machine here it's an 89 case 5 ATK
real<00:01:24.540> good<00:01:24.720> machine<00:01:25.140> IRS<00:01:25.920> bro<00:01:26.340> hires<00:01:27.080> but

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
real good machine IRS bro hires but

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
real good machine IRS bro hires but
don't<00:01:29.729> need<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> spend<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> money<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
don't need to spend a lot of money to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
don't need to spend a lot of money to
get<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> same<00:01:32.299> effect<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:35.060> both

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
get the same effect as you can see both

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
get the same effect as you can see both
outrages<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.880> there's<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> tire<00:01:41.420> here's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
outrages right there's the tire here's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.980 
outrages right there's the tire here's
the<00:01:42.570> other<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:42.990> holes<00:01:44.659> where<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.780> had<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the other two holes where we had to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.490 
the other two holes where we had to
remove<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> bolts<00:01:46.829> here<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:49.229> order

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
remove the bolts here and here in order

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030 
remove the bolts here and here in order
to<00:01:49.680> allow<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.189> come<00:01:50.310> down<00:01:50.579> over<00:01:51.560> here<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to allow that to come down over here you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.090 
to allow that to come down over here you
can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.750> I've<00:01:54.750> already<00:01:54.960> unbolted<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> axle

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
can see I've already unbolted the axle

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.719 
can see I've already unbolted the axle
from<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> housing<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.509> slid<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.729> when

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
from the housing and slid it out when

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
from the housing and slid it out when
lowering<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.180> down<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.390> had<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.719> disconnect<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
lowering it down I had to disconnect the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.330 
lowering it down I had to disconnect the
linkage<00:02:03.320> because<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> lake<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.619> knocks<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
linkage because the lake is knocks it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.029 
linkage because the lake is knocks it
into<00:02:06.119> gear<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.380> lowering<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
into gear when you're lowering when you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.869 
into gear when you're lowering when you
lifted<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> machine<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.440> which

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
lifted a machine back up which

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.940 
lifted a machine back up which
the<00:02:11.269> rear<00:02:11.480> end<00:02:11.659> stays<00:02:11.900> down<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.469> machine<00:02:12.799> goes

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
the rear end stays down the machine goes

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.300 
the rear end stays down the machine goes
up<00:02:13.189> is<00:02:13.340> kinda<00:02:13.610> like<00:02:13.670> lowering<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:15.069> we<00:02:16.069> got<00:02:16.219> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
up is kinda like lowering it we got to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.979 
up is kinda like lowering it we got to
remove<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.670> linkage<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.359> doesn't<00:02:17.689> pop<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
remove the linkage so it doesn't pop it

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.569 
remove the linkage so it doesn't pop it
out<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.200> gear<00:02:18.379> because<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.769> won't<00:02:19.040> start<00:02:19.340> back

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
out of gear because it won't start back

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:32.309 
out of gear because it won't start back
up<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:20.030> lower<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:23.560> also<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:28.420> remove<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.629> pin

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.440 

from<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.560> linkage<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.700> puts<00:02:34.939> it<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.359> out

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
from this linkage it puts it in and out

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.539 
from this linkage it puts it in and out
of<00:02:35.599> gear<00:02:39.849> right<00:02:40.849> there<00:02:40.879> there's<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.870> pin

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
of gear right there there's a pin

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.080 
of gear right there there's a pin
there's<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.730> pin<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.750> anything<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.139> removed<00:02:45.590> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
there's the pin so anything I removed I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.940 
there's the pin so anything I removed I
removed<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.209> pin<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.780> allow<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.230> state

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
removed that pin and allow the state

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.080 
removed that pin and allow the state
running<00:02:52.310> well<00:02:53.269> restart<00:02:53.870> actually<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:55.760> anyhow

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.379 
running well restart actually but anyhow
I<00:02:56.419> was<00:02:57.379> going<00:02:57.650> on<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.889> road<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.370> just<00:02:58.639> gone<00:02:59.120> down

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
I was going on the road I just gone down

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.580 
I was going on the road I just gone down
a<00:02:59.419> steep<00:02:59.810> hill<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.909> I<00:03:01.909> was<00:03:01.939> in<00:03:02.329> 4th<00:03:03.169> gear<00:03:03.439> on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
a steep hill and I was in 4th gear on

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.429 
a steep hill and I was in 4th gear on
the<00:03:03.709> level<00:03:04.269> when<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.359> right<00:03:05.569> wheel<00:03:05.840> locked<00:03:06.169> up

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
the level when the right wheel locked up

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.629 
the level when the right wheel locked up
it<00:03:07.340> was<00:03:07.489> plenty<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.879> oil<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.239> there<00:03:09.519> there<00:03:10.519> was

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
it was plenty of oil in there there was

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.140 
it was plenty of oil in there there was
no<00:03:10.819> real<00:03:11.060> signs<00:03:11.389> like<00:03:12.379> I<00:03:12.470> said<00:03:12.709> it's<00:03:13.700> old<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
no real signs like I said it's old the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.240 
no real signs like I said it's old the
machines<00:03:14.540> old<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.199> see<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> parts<00:03:15.889> that<00:03:15.979> came

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
machines old you see the parts that came

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.809 
machines old you see the parts that came
out<00:03:20.530> whenever<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:22.159> tore<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.669> apart<00:03:24.430> as<00:03:25.430> high

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
out whenever I tore that apart as high

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.300 
out whenever I tore that apart as high
hours<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.510> lot<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.959> hours<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.379> machine<00:03:27.709> our

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
hours a lot of hours on the machine our

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.949 
hours a lot of hours on the machine our
meter<00:03:28.760> quit<00:03:29.090> at<00:03:29.209> 7,000<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.349> we<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.579> guess

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
meter quit at 7,000 so we can just guess

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.199 
meter quit at 7,000 so we can just guess
as<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.139> can<00:03:33.319> see<00:03:33.530> here<00:03:34.659> the<00:03:35.659> ring<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.500> broken

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
as you can see here the ring is broken

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.830 
as you can see here the ring is broken
was<00:03:38.209> actually<00:03:38.750> doubled<00:03:39.199> over<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:40.840> which

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
was actually doubled over here which

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.189 
was actually doubled over here which
really<00:03:42.319> put<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.859> on<00:03:42.979> a<00:03:43.010> wedge<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:45.019> see

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
really put it on a wedge you can see

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.589 
really put it on a wedge you can see
that<00:03:45.349> other<00:03:45.530> gear<00:03:45.949> in<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.250> back<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:47.269> part<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
that other gear in the back the part of

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.899 
that other gear in the back the part of
the<00:03:47.690> ring<00:03:47.870> gear<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:51.609> planetaries<00:03:52.609> are<00:03:52.699> put

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
the ring gear the planetaries are put

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.089 
the ring gear the planetaries are put
this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.209> all<00:03:53.359> planetary<00:03:53.959> pretty<00:03:54.919> well<00:03:55.069> shot

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
this is all planetary pretty well shot

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.349 
this is all planetary pretty well shot
you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.909> see<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:58.280> crack<00:03:58.639> in<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.060> case<00:03:59.720> there

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
you can see the crack in the case there

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.429 
you can see the crack in the case there
and

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:13.640 

another<00:04:07.439> crack<00:04:08.959> right<00:04:09.959> there<00:04:10.909> so<00:04:12.650> it's

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
another crack right there so it's

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.060 
another crack right there so it's
probably<00:04:14.129> not<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.370> good<00:04:14.640> idea<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.180> well<00:04:15.360> does

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.860 

that<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.579> ring<00:04:20.910> should<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.209> pressed<00:04:21.630> in

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
that that ring should be pressed in

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.150 
that that ring should be pressed in
there<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:23.539> that<00:04:24.539> may<00:04:24.780> have<00:04:24.900> spread<00:04:25.259> case<00:04:25.710> just

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
there so that may have spread case just

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.890 
there so that may have spread case just
enough<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.669> allow<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.060> not<00:04:29.750> press<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:31.020> tight

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
enough to allow it to not press in tight

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.540 
enough to allow it to not press in tight
if<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.139> loose<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.889> do<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.310> same

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
if it's loose it's going to do the same

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.300 
if it's loose it's going to do the same
thing<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.970> thing<00:04:39.240> called<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:39.600> Sun<00:04:40.310> Sun

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
brake disc this is the brake ring there

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.060 
brake disc this is the brake ring there
it's<00:05:09.449> not<00:05:09.690> bad<00:05:09.990> but<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.260> got<00:05:10.440> chewed<00:05:10.680> up<00:05:10.800> in

also we're gonna see what we could do
get<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.669> new<00:05:26.789> parts<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.870> we<00:05:27.990> can<00:05:28.169> get<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.380> back

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
get the new parts so we can get it back

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.320 
get the new parts so we can get it back
together<00:05:28.770> here<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.020> get<00:05:31.020> back<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.440> digging

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
together here and get back to digging

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.170 
together here and get back to digging
it's<00:05:33.330> not<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> whole<00:05:33.690> lot<00:05:33.900> on<00:05:34.080> YouTube<00:05:35.180> showing

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
it's not a whole lot on YouTube showing

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.960 
it's not a whole lot on YouTube showing
you<00:05:36.449> any<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.690> this<00:05:36.780> work<00:05:37.080> but<00:05:37.710> as<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.760> just

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
you any of this work but as I just

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.770 
you any of this work but as I just
showed<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.180> son<00:05:39.630> it's<00:05:40.229> just<00:05:40.440> time<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:41.780> probably

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
showed you son it's just time I probably

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.390 
showed you son it's just time I probably
spent<00:05:43.110> more<00:05:43.260> time<00:05:43.320> getting<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.889> wheels<00:05:44.099> off

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
spent more time getting the wheels off

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.779 
spent more time getting the wheels off
the<00:05:45.030> lug<00:05:45.210> nuts<00:05:46.310> probably<00:05:47.310> than<00:05:47.460> I<00:05:47.550> did

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
the lug nuts probably than I did

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.610 
the lug nuts probably than I did
anything<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:50.010> four<00:05:50.280> bolts<00:05:50.669> here<00:05:51.409> that<00:05:52.409> allow

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
anything the four bolts here that allow
