great to photograph and there's just so
many<00:00:10.019> beautiful<00:00:10.260> effects<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.070> get<00:00:11.460> when

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
many beautiful effects you can get when

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.370 
many beautiful effects you can get when
you<00:00:12.150> use<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> proper<00:00:12.870> equipment<00:00:12.960> and

you need are a camera you need a good

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.939 
you need are a camera you need a good
tripod<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.880> keep<00:00:21.029> things<00:00:21.330> steady<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
tripod so you can keep things steady and

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.750 
tripod so you can keep things steady and
something<00:00:22.949> else<00:00:23.070> you're<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.519> need<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
something else you're going to need that

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.310 
something else you're going to need that
I<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.029> suggest<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.570> couple<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.960> things<00:00:25.170> are

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
I would suggest a couple of things are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.890 
I would suggest a couple of things are
going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.740> help<00:00:26.010> our<00:00:26.310> an<00:00:26.849> ND<00:00:27.630> or

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
going to really help our an ND or

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to really help our an ND or
neutral<00:00:28.260> density<00:00:28.380> filter<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.420> a<00:00:30.420> polarizing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
neutral density filter and a polarizing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.190 
neutral density filter and a polarizing
filter<00:00:31.969> now<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> reason<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:33.989> two

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
filter now the reason you want these two

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
filter now the reason you want these two
items<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> sort<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.610> explain<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
items is I'm going to sort of explain it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
items is I'm going to sort of explain it
now<00:00:36.270> why<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.380> shot<00:00:37.620> you're<00:00:37.829> seeing<00:00:38.100> right

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
now why the shot you're seeing right

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
now why the shot you're seeing right
here<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:38.670> shot<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> 50th<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
here was shot at a bit of 50th of a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.860 
here was shot at a bit of 50th of a
second<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.640> using<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.540> ND

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
second and it was not using the ND

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.500 
second and it was not using the ND
filter<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.530> polarizing<00:00:44.190> filter<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> as

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
filter and the polarizing filter and as

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.990 
filter and the polarizing filter and as
you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> shot<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.670> almost

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you can see when I shot it it's almost

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
you can see when I shot it it's almost
the<00:00:48.149> same<00:00:48.329> effect<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> flash

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the same effect as when you have a flash

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
the same effect as when you have a flash
that<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.550> water<00:00:50.820> everything<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.780> well

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that the water everything is pretty well

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.040 
that the water everything is pretty well
pretty<00:00:52.559> well<00:00:52.800> frozen<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> time<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.780> not

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pretty well frozen in time and it's not

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.500 
pretty well frozen in time and it's not
the<00:00:55.289> effect<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.920> looking<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:57.360> by

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the effect i was looking for but by

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.959 
the effect i was looking for but by
using<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.079> ND<00:00:58.440> filter<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> polarizing

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
using the ND filter and the polarizing

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.330 
using the ND filter and the polarizing
filter<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.199> would<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> in

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
filter what that would do is that in

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.149 
filter what that would do is that in
effect<00:01:02.510> change<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.989> shutter<00:01:04.350> speed<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.769> kept<00:01:05.010> my

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
effect change my shutter speed i kept my

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
effect change my shutter speed i kept my
aperture<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.939> small<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.420> possible<00:01:06.710> but<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
aperture as small as possible but when I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
aperture as small as possible but when I
put<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> shutter<00:01:08.640> speed<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> put<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
put the shutter speed when I put the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.859 
put the shutter speed when I put the
filter<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> polarizing<00:01:11.189> filter<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
filter and the polarizing filter on it

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.179 
filter and the polarizing filter on it
what<00:01:12.869> happened<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
what happened is now you can see what

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
what happened is now you can see what
the<00:01:14.280> shot<00:01:14.520> looks<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> did

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the shot looks like because what it did

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
the shot looks like because what it did
it<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> effect<00:01:17.220> changed<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:17.759> shutter<00:01:18.030> speed

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it in effect changed my shutter speed

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.590 
it in effect changed my shutter speed
from<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> 50<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> second<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.310> 1.2<00:01:21.119> seconds

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
from a 50 to the second to 1.2 seconds

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050 
from a 50 to the second to 1.2 seconds
it<00:01:22.140> almost<00:01:22.369> doubled<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> amount<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.790> time

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it almost doubled the amount of time

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.990 
it almost doubled the amount of time
that<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.360> shutter<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.869> open<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:26.000> with

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that the shutter was open and with

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
that the shutter was open and with
having<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> tripod<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.110> anything

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
having the tripod have anything

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
having the tripod have anything
everything<00:01:28.650> nice<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.860> steady<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:30.270> long

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
everything nice and steady that long

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
everything nice and steady that long
shutter<00:01:30.990> speed<00:01:31.380> gets<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> beautiful<00:01:32.430> silky

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
shutter speed gets that beautiful silky

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
shutter speed gets that beautiful silky
effect<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> water<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> exactly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
effect to the water which is exactly

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.370 
effect to the water which is exactly
what<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.100> looking<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.750> again<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> way

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
what I was looking for so again the way

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
what I was looking for so again the way
you're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.130> effects<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
you're going to get these effects is you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
you're going to get these effects is you
want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.869> first<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.220> slow

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
want to have first of all a very slow

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.090 
want to have first of all a very slow
shutter<00:01:41.820> speed<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> camera<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.860> want

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
shutter speed with the camera you want

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
shutter speed with the camera you want
it<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> half<00:01:45.329> second<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:45.930> slower<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it about a half second or slower for it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069 
it about a half second or slower for it
to<00:01:46.770> work<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> ways<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> good<00:01:48.840> things

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to work now the ways this is good things

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.330 
to work now the ways this is good things
are<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> happen<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.860> effects<00:01:50.220> are

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
are going to happen these effects are

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.800 
are going to happen these effects are
going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> happen<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.420> talked<00:01:51.689> about

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
going to happen is as I talked about

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
going to happen is as I talked about
putting<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.860> two<00:01:53.100> filters<00:01:53.430> combined<00:01:54.119> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
putting the two filters combined in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
putting the two filters combined in
front<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.869> lens<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.829> certainly

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
front of your lens that's certainly

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.679 
front of your lens that's certainly
going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> reduce<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.149> amount<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.479> light

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
going to reduce the amount of light

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
going to reduce the amount of light
getting<00:01:57.990> into<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> camera<00:01:58.649> other<00:01:59.520> things

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
getting into the camera other things

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
getting into the camera other things
that<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.119> help<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> shoot

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that would help is you want to shoot

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289 
that would help is you want to shoot
this<00:02:01.710> earlier<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> morning<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.060> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this earlier in the morning if you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
this earlier in the morning if you can
when<00:02:03.570> there's<00:02:03.750> less<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> light<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.829> not

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
when there's less when the light is not

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
when there's less when the light is not
as<00:02:05.310> intense<00:02:05.689> shoot<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> evening<00:02:07.409> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
as intense shoot it in the evening you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
as intense shoot it in the evening you
know<00:02:07.740> obviously<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.310> opposite<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> shooting

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
know obviously the opposite of shooting

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.150 
know obviously the opposite of shooting
in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> morning<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.770> shoot<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
in the morning if you can shoot on a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
in the morning if you can shoot on a
cloudy<00:02:11.550> day<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.360> make<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> difference

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
cloudy day that will make a difference

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.430 
cloudy day that will make a difference
as<00:02:13.170> well

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
as well

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230 
as well
I'll<00:02:13.500> less<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.430> getting<00:02:14.820> into<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
I'll less like getting into the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.870 
I'll less like getting into the
waterfall<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> also<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.370> waterfall

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
waterfall and also if the waterfall

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.090 
waterfall and also if the waterfall
happens<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> shade<00:02:18.990> all<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.950> these

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
happens to be in the shade all of these

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.470 
happens to be in the shade all of these
factors<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.910> contribute<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
factors are going to contribute to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.870 
factors are going to contribute to
having<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.870> nice<00:02:22.020> slow<00:02:22.380> shutter<00:02:22.740> speed<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.340> get

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
having a nice slow shutter speed to get

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630 
having a nice slow shutter speed to get
this<00:02:24.030> beautiful<00:02:24.270> movement<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.020> water<00:02:25.640> you

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
this beautiful movement of the water you

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
this beautiful movement of the water you
also<00:02:26.820> want<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.270> set<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.570> camera<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
also want to set your camera for the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.550 
also want to set your camera for the
lowest<00:02:28.650> ISO<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.000> well<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.570> again<00:02:31.260> less

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
lowest ISO you can as well so again less

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
lowest ISO you can as well so again less
life<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:31.980> getting<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.720> set<00:02:33.720> your<00:02:33.900> aperture

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
life is getting in and set your aperture

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.260 
life is getting in and set your aperture
as<00:02:34.500> low<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.070> high<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> can<00:02:35.610> at<00:02:35.940> f/16

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
as low as you as high as you can at f/16

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.290 
as low as you as high as you can at f/16
or<00:02:36.720> f-22<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.760> these<00:02:39.030> things

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
or f-22 so that all these things

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.950 
or f-22 so that all these things
combined<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.590> give<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> nice<00:02:41.520> slow<00:02:42.300> shutter

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
combined to give you a nice slow shutter

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.020 
combined to give you a nice slow shutter
speed<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.520> makes<00:02:44.700> all<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
speed and that's what makes all the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.280 
speed and that's what makes all the
difference<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> world<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.930> getting<00:02:46.230> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
difference in the world in getting a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.520 
difference in the world in getting a
shot<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:47.690> now<00:02:48.690> even<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.110> you're<00:02:49.260> doing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
shot like this now even if you're doing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
shot like this now even if you're doing
when<00:02:49.770> you're<00:02:49.860> shooting<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.430> when<00:02:51.150> you're<00:02:51.270> doing

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
when you're shooting a when you're doing

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.630 
when you're shooting a when you're doing
a<00:02:51.510> waterfall<00:02:52.020> obviously<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> water<00:02:53.340> has<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
a waterfall obviously the water has to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.370 
a waterfall obviously the water has to
go<00:02:53.850> somewhere<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.720> usually<00:02:55.020> flowing

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
go somewhere and it's usually flowing

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.520 
go somewhere and it's usually flowing
with<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.650> stream<00:02:56.010> down<00:02:57.050> below<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.200> waterfall

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with a stream down below the waterfall

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.350 
with a stream down below the waterfall
and<00:02:58.980> that's<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.430> happened<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.330> show

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and that's what happened here I can show

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.510 
and that's what happened here I can show
you<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> same<00:03:00.930> effect<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.440> happens<00:03:01.860> this

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
you the same effect that happens this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.270 
you the same effect that happens this
shot<00:03:02.820> was<00:03:03.030> taken<00:03:03.140> no<00:03:04.140> filters<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.890> camera

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
shot was taken no filters on the camera

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.880 
shot was taken no filters on the camera
and<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.940> was<00:03:06.030> shot<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.540> about<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.960> 40th<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.800> a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and it was shot at about a 40th of a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.070 
and it was shot at about a 40th of a
second<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.360> everything<00:03:09.960> is

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
second and as you can see everything is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080 
second and as you can see everything is
pretty<00:03:10.380> pretty<00:03:10.860> well<00:03:11.100> frozen<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> bit

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
pretty pretty well frozen there's a bit

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.390 
pretty pretty well frozen there's a bit
of<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.330> movement<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.840> water<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> lot

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
of a movement to the water but not a lot

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
of a movement to the water but not a lot
because<00:03:14.970> again<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.600> was<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.320> lot<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.800> light<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
because again I was a lot of light a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.350 
because again I was a lot of light a
fair<00:03:17.310> amount<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.640> light<00:03:17.820> was<00:03:17.970> getting<00:03:18.270> in

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360
