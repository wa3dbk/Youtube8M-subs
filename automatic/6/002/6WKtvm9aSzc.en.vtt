00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
we don't want to make any mistakes it's
almost<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.189> say<00:01:23.670> anything<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.710> we

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
almost like we can say anything but we

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.760 
almost like we can say anything but we
don't<00:01:26.100> necessarily<00:01:26.479> better<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.900> though<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
don't necessarily better not though is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160 
don't necessarily better not though is
but<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.180> following<00:01:30.600> through

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
but we don't but following through

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.100 
but we don't but following through
becomes<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.670> difficult<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:33.540> dealing<00:01:33.810> with

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
becomes more difficult or dealing with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
becomes more difficult or dealing with
the<00:01:34.229> after-effects<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.400> together<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the after-effects we're together to the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140 
the after-effects we're together to the
problem<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> prom<00:01:37.439> there's<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.490> mean<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
problem to the prom there's I mean it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
problem to the prom there's I mean it's
it's<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.350> first<00:01:40.680> step<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.280> bold

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's like the the first step the bold

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.050 
it's like the the first step the bold
part<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.210> easy<00:01:43.049> until<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.880> we're

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
part is easy until we do it so we're

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.399 
part is easy until we do it so we're
going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> tell<00:01:45.479> them<00:01:45.630> tomorrow<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.350> to

going to tell them tomorrow is going to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.340 
going to tell them tomorrow is going to
be<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> greatest<00:01:47.130> planet<00:01:47.790> pulse<00:01:48.090> show<00:01:48.720> they
