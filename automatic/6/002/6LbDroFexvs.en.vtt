decent<00:01:11.369> hair<00:01:11.549> 1.73<00:01:12.539> why<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.009> will

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
decent hair 1.73 why is that and will

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
decent hair 1.73 why is that and will
you<00:01:14.219> take<00:01:14.429> that<00:01:14.609> bet<00:01:15.049> well<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> was

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you take that bet well when I was

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
you take that bet well when I was
looking<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.770> found<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.219> few<00:01:17.369> jobs<00:01:17.670> around

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
looking actually found a few jobs around

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.769 
looking actually found a few jobs around
1.6<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.929> which<00:01:19.109> I<00:01:19.229> thought<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.590> too<00:01:19.859> low<00:01:20.779> 1.73

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:21.779 
1.6 one which I thought was too low 1.73

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.019 
1.6 one which I thought was too low 1.73
yeah<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:22.679> getting<00:01:23.459> more<00:01:23.609> towards<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:24.029 
yeah that's getting more towards the

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.300 
yeah that's getting more towards the
arrow<00:01:24.179> I'd<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.599> I<00:01:24.779> think<00:01:25.469> people<00:01:25.829> are<00:01:26.039> looking

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
arrow I'd one I think people are looking

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
arrow I'd one I think people are looking
at<00:01:26.399> by<00:01:26.549> Munich<00:01:26.880> strong<00:01:27.119> defense<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.779> seeing

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
at by Munich strong defense and seeing

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
at by Munich strong defense and seeing
some<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.829> injury<00:01:29.130> problems<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
some of the injury problems that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
some of the injury problems that
Manchester<00:01:30.779> City<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.499> their<00:01:31.649> last<00:01:31.829> game

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
Manchester City have in their last game

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.709 
Manchester City have in their last game
they<00:01:32.759> didn't<00:01:32.999> because<00:01:33.119> though<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.509> could

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
they didn't because though they could

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.129 
they didn't because though they could
really<00:01:34.139> keep<00:01:35.069> a<00:01:35.219> clean<00:01:35.429> sheet<00:01:35.459> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.659> think

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
really keep a clean sheet so I think

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.870 
really keep a clean sheet so I think
they<00:01:37.319> might<00:01:37.499> be<00:01:37.799> thinking<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.549> minute

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
they might be thinking that by minute

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.339 
they might be thinking that by minute
can<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> win<00:01:39.539> here<00:01:39.749> and<00:01:39.899> keep<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.139> clean

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:40.349 
can get a win here and keep the clean

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.440 
can get a win here and keep the clean
sheet<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.039> keep<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.639> game<00:01:41.789> india<00:01:42.119> under<00:01:42.209> that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
sheet so keep the game india under that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.809 
sheet so keep the game india under that
way<00:01:42.619> okay<00:01:43.619> interesting<00:01:43.859> because<00:01:44.429> i<00:01:44.639> actually

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
way okay interesting because i actually

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.609 
way okay interesting because i actually
like<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.209> bet<00:01:45.359> both<00:01:45.539> teams<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.139> score<00:01:46.169> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
like the bet both teams to score and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
like the bet both teams to score and
that's<00:01:46.679> priced<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.279> point<00:01:47.459> seven<00:01:48.149> three

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's priced at one point seven three

too<00:02:14.400> good<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.790> me<00:02:14.880> i'm<00:02:15.000> quite<00:02:15.390> happy<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.690> us

too good for me i'm quite happy with us
and<00:02:16.110> i<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.530> by<00:02:16.710> marek<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> strong

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and i think that by marek have a strong

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.610 
and i think that by marek have a strong
defense<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.450> very<00:02:18.630> strong<00:02:18.870> goalkeeper<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
defense and a very strong goalkeeper and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.930 
defense and a very strong goalkeeper and
i<00:02:20.100> think<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.580> be<00:02:20.670> enough<00:02:20.760> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
i think that's going to be enough to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.610 
i think that's going to be enough to
keep<00:02:21.030> man<00:02:21.240> city<00:02:21.450> out<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:22.170> right<00:02:22.410> wonderful
