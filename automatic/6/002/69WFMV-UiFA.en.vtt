00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rusty bottle caps but it was this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
rusty bottle caps but it was this
particular<00:00:56.820> garbage<00:00:57.629> area<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> caught

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
particular garbage area here that caught

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
particular garbage area here that caught
our<00:00:59.160> attention<00:00:59.300> it<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.449> rained<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.960> night

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
our attention it had rained the night

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.439 
our attention it had rained the night
before<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.309> top<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.820> we've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.210> some

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
before and on top of that we've got some

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.260 
before and on top of that we've got some
trapped<00:01:03.750> moisture<00:01:04.430> inside<00:01:05.430> these<00:01:05.640> bags<00:01:06.000> which

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
trapped moisture inside these bags which

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.980 
trapped moisture inside these bags which
are<00:01:06.450> blue

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
are blue

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
are blue
happen<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.619> some<00:01:08.040> red<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
happen to have some red as well as the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
happen to have some red as well as the
blue<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
blue that you see here and now the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
blue that you see here and now the
question<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.689> technically<00:01:13.350> probably<00:01:14.130> going

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
question is technically probably going

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.810 
question is technically probably going
to<00:01:14.340> pull<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.670> off<00:01:14.820> well

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
to pull that off well

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.700 
to pull that off well
a<00:01:15.850> lot<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.270> depth<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.690> field<00:01:16.870> as<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.560> case

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
a lot of depth of field as is the case

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.310 
a lot of depth of field as is the case
with<00:01:17.770> most<00:01:18.130> macro<00:01:18.610> shots<00:01:18.909> so<00:01:19.630> I'm<00:01:19.750> already<00:01:19.930> at

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
with most macro shots so I'm already at

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.310 
with most macro shots so I'm already at
f-22<00:01:20.979> because<00:01:21.610> I'm<00:01:21.760> not<00:01:21.940> in<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.780> case

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
f-22 because I'm not in this case

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.680 
f-22 because I'm not in this case
shooting<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.130> flat<00:01:24.400> subject<00:01:24.970> got<00:01:25.090> bagged<00:01:25.390> that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
shooting a flat subject got bagged that

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.540 
shooting a flat subject got bagged that
we<00:01:25.780> see<00:01:26.020> here<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.350> somewhat<00:01:26.830> tilted<00:01:27.370> like<00:01:27.520> a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
we see here is somewhat tilted like a

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.490 
we see here is somewhat tilted like a
little<00:01:27.820> bit<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.090> mountain<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:28.930> from<00:01:29.410> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
little bit of a mountain so from the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.680 
little bit of a mountain so from the
mountain<00:01:29.800> top<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.250> down<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.760> side<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.630> you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
mountain top on down to the side as you

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.870 
mountain top on down to the side as you
can<00:01:31.990> see<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.650> I<00:01:32.920> need<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.430> lot<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.700> depth

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
can see like so I need a lot of depth

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.600 
can see like so I need a lot of depth
appeal<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.140> overcast<00:01:35.560> there<00:01:36.160> for<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
appeal it is overcast there for the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.460 
appeal it is overcast there for the
exposure<00:01:37.119> on<00:01:37.300> this<00:01:37.600> could<00:01:37.780> easily<00:01:37.900> be<00:01:38.110> done<00:01:38.320> in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
exposure on this could easily be done in

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.800 
exposure on this could easily be done in
aperture<00:01:38.710> priority<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:40.030> being<00:01:40.300> a<00:01:40.450> manual
