00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
December to March of next year so that

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
doesn't make any damn bit of sense I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.060 
doesn't make any damn bit of sense I
mean<00:03:28.140> there's<00:03:28.440> still<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.620> bunch<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.860> stuff

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
mean there's still a bunch of stuff

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.800 
mean there's still a bunch of stuff
going<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.430> there<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.910> then<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.540> about<00:03:30.780> I

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
going on there and then to think about I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.229 
going on there and then to think about I
got<00:03:30.989> stuff<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.709> get<00:03:31.800> rid<00:03:31.980> of

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
got stuff on there I got to get rid of

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.420 
got stuff on there I got to get rid of
so<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:34.230> seems<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.680> pointless<00:03:34.860> after<00:03:35.310> all

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
so it seems kind of pointless after all

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.340 
so it seems kind of pointless after all
these<00:03:35.580> years<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.180> people<00:03:36.330> grinding<00:03:37.170> their
