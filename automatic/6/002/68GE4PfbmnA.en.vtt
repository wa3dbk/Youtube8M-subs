00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 Welcome to the export if I am again 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 Here are there live in 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 conception of the game plan itself 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.430
 around the whole series in short videos 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 to hold and no long lectures too 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 we are still looking at the specifications 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 at times we have 120 repetitions per 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.349
 week for the big muscle groups 70 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 for the small weekly we want that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.460
 all of two times per week, we make time 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.800
 a 48 hour regeneration for the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 muscle groups in themselves we want in 48 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 hours then growth and we have in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.379
 combination as we want a lot 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.200
 combine synergy effects 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.820
 So muscle groups play together 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.649
 to let 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.030
 If, for example, we have the parapet 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.890
 we'll be on the triceps so well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.780
 It makes perfect sense the triceps with it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.440
 to purify 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 Of course you can, of course 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.320
 the tips against the biceps then too 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.480
 exchange part 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 one does not come with the regeneration 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 more like still growing maybe 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.070
 no longer that way and we want 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.830
 Of course as often as possible into a workout 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 which is just by our twice per 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 week once or twice a week 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 want because the muscle groups appeal 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.509
 that is actually already got by it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.830
 that means we want to and have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.020
 I already said at the beginning it works 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 to have a threefold split means we have 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.520
 one day a day b and c begins 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:35.020
 now just before that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 we are still off on the day and c 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.369
 as I said we actually want the 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.200
 Muscles such a part that was nice 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.110
 growth have unsightly regeneration 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.369
 we actually have, so to speak 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:55.280
 still tag.de and this day de is just 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:58.130
 many will say our break now 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.630
 man this break three days 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.640
 one after the other into the workout go the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.739
 one reads often one is not even that way 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.630
 was allowed because of the central nervous system 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.610
 we already take care of the central 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.060
 Nervous system by simply the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.920
 Repeat these 120 or 70 levels 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.209
 through these two divide and the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.190
 burden on the central nervous system 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.079
 of course keep accordingly low 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.730
 because, of course, ten sentences h12 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.890
 repetitions 12 sentences year ten 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.269
 Repeats to my chest knocks 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.340
 then of course we have to 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.140
 central nervous system every two three days 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.200
 or every two days actually one 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.350
 give a break and then or can 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 triceps that means who conceptualize a 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.540
 b and c we have these three days like this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.230
 now at this 48 hour regeneration 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.769
 We 're still growing 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.519
 actually 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.519
 hk 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.420
 Breast shoulder and triceps says b the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.310
 legs 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.220
 Of course, doing the legs was not 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.960
 the legs hurt sake or legs 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.190
 because of course, but we do that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.870
 whole but for the hormone release 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.070
 and allowed for our upper body 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.810
 then there was a chamber at the legs 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.840
 basic exercises very well accommodate 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.490
 on on upper body naturally meat 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.590
 the lips bring muscles 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:36.990
 That's what we're down here for now 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:39.840
 contribution cvc is still in our favor 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.040
 The biceps and I just take it now 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.830
 the belly with purely 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.420
 you can do it but you do not have that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.900
 means to always deliver with the basic exercises 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.459
 to have 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.110
 that is, if you have a lot of dumbbells 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.490
 was able to do long exercises 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.250
 actually get on the belly because of the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.840
 stabilize and you will then 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.870
 we see that every single day 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.209
 of course split up accordingly 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.610
 will you see that chest and shoulder 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.489
 that was also in the back on these days 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.780
 maybe one or the other 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.489
 there will be a discussion topic here 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.150
 the shoulder was the shoulder is very much 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.410
 very very monotonous to worry about 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.550
 it will turn away a bit 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.940
 the basic exercises against the one yes 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.950
 actually you actually wanted 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.080
 But the chest and the back takes 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.590
 actually very much at the shoulder 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.970
 very much away so that will be our view 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:34.290
 are giving the next weeks 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:40.020
 fact is break and then it goes event 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.570
 again of course with ab and c of course 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.890
 Continue accordingly, perhaps 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.560
 but a bit atypical was the three 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.810
 have days in a row but we have 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.790
 Six days, so to speak, during the week 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.220
 train the week at the vae and five 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.110
 days depending on how the breaks are 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.680
 means we want yes and that is life 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.479
 the story often goes into training 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.090
 we still see the basic exercises world 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:06.050
 combine the whole story breast 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.410
 So shoulder triceps up a pool 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.870
 puzzle together push pull split with the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.970
 Cry we have it twice 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.070
 week or one and a half times 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.360
 actually on average we have the 48th 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.150
 hours of regeneration in there for 48 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.940
 hours and another 48 hours 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.300
 that 's definitely in here we have 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.380
 48 hours and 48 hours of growth 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.210
 we combine 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.180
 twice a week and this one 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:39.560
 repetition numbers and just the height 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.690
 what will you do accordingly? 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.120
 see and that will be the next videos 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.009
 then pray and contract his contract there 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.639
 shape and see you again 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.639
 which works well
