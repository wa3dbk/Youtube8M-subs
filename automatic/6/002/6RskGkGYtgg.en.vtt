hey what is up guys I'm QB HD here and
the<00:00:06.089> idea<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.660> video<00:00:06.839> came<00:00:07.259> from<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
the idea for this video came from a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.350 
the idea for this video came from a
bunch<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.919> test<00:00:08.280> footage<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.639> shot<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
bunch of test footage I shot so it's a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240 
bunch of test footage I shot so it's a
little<00:00:09.570> bit<00:00:09.660> short<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
little bit short but I really like the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.709 
little bit short but I really like the
footage<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.759> wanted<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> upload<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.420> anyway

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
footage so I wanted to upload it anyway

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.509 
footage so I wanted to upload it anyway
or<00:00:12.960> at<00:00:13.080> least<00:00:13.230> include<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> video<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
or at least include it in the video so

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
or at least include it in the video so
this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.030> everything<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.870> need<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> know

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this is everything you need to know

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
this is everything you need to know
about<00:00:16.500> open-back<00:00:17.160> headphones<00:00:17.369> there<00:00:17.789> are

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
about open-back headphones there are

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.490 
about open-back headphones there are
only<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.210> two<00:00:18.359> types<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.900> headphones<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
only really two types of headphones and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.570 
only really two types of headphones and
if<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> market<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.220> make<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
if you're in the market to make a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.400 
if you're in the market to make a
decision<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.720> pretty<00:00:21.900> good<00:00:22.050> idea<00:00:22.230> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
decision it's a pretty good idea to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
decision it's a pretty good idea to
understand<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> basic<00:00:23.279> differences<00:00:23.670> between

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
understand the basic differences between

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
understand the basic differences between
the<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.840> there's<00:00:25.050> closed<00:00:25.350> back

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the two so there's closed back

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.560 
the two so there's closed back
headphones<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> open-back<00:00:27.000> headphones<00:00:27.240> so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
headphones and open-back headphones so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
headphones and open-back headphones so
most<00:00:27.750> headphones<00:00:27.900> you'll<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.680> closed

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
most headphones you'll see are closed

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.650 
most headphones you'll see are closed
back<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.210> most<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> us

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
back and that's because most of us

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.870 
back and that's because most of us
listen<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> headphones<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.460> hear<00:00:32.730> our

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
listen to headphones to just hear our

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
listen to headphones to just hear our
music<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.930> anything<00:00:34.230> else<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.800> whether

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
music and not anything else so whether

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.500 
music and not anything else so whether
we're<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> commute<00:00:35.760> or<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.090> working<00:00:36.360> out

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

or whatever we're doing listening music

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
or whatever we're doing listening music

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we just want to hear the audio and not

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
we just want to hear the audio and not
our<00:00:40.860> environment<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.000> closed<00:00:42.450> back

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
our environment so closed back

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.209 
our environment so closed back
headphones<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.290> by<00:00:43.410> creating<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.890> seal

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
headphones do this by creating a seal

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
headphones do this by creating a seal
around<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.670> ear<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.210> isolate<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> noise<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
around your ear to isolate the noise and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.860 
around your ear to isolate the noise and
separate<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> inside<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> outside<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
separate the inside from the outside a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
separate the inside from the outside a

the headphones on my list which was the

monitor and they are closed back

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.550 
monitor and they are closed back
headphones<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.510> isolate<00:01:10.080> your

other quiet solo listening environment

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
other quiet solo listening environment
you<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.340> need<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> isolation<00:01:18.360> between

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you don't need that isolation between

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
you don't need that isolation between
yourself<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> outside<00:01:19.530> noise<00:01:19.680> because

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
yourself and the outside noise because

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800 
yourself and the outside noise because
there<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> no<00:01:20.430> outside<00:01:20.580> noise<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.659> when

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there is no outside noise so that's when

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
there is no outside noise so that's when
you<00:01:21.900> might<00:01:22.020> explore<00:01:22.439> open-back<00:01:23.040> headphones

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you might explore open-back headphones

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
you might explore open-back headphones
so<00:01:23.970> open<00:01:24.299> back<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> name<00:01:25.140> implies<00:01:25.470> means

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so open back as the name implies means

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
so open back as the name implies means
the<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> headphones<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.479> literally

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the back of the headphones are literally

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.390 
the back of the headphones are literally
open<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:28.500> barrier<00:01:28.920> between<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
open there's no barrier between the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.179 
open there's no barrier between the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
natural sound where it sounds like the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
natural sound where it sounds like the
music<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.220> coming<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.149> room<00:01:48.390> around<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
music is coming from the room around you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
music is coming from the room around you
instead<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.829> being<00:01:50.070> played<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.060> head

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
instead of being played into your head

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
instead of being played into your head
this<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.570> what's<00:01:51.750> called<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.140> wider<00:01:52.530> soundstage

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this is what's called a wider soundstage

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.560 
this is what's called a wider soundstage
where<00:01:53.729> essentially<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> stronger<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
where essentially the stronger this

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
where essentially the stronger this
effect<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:55.530> it'll<00:01:55.680> sound<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
effect is the more it'll sound like the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
effect is the more it'll sound like the
sound<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> coming<00:01:56.790> from<00:01:56.969> further<00:01:57.810> away<00:01:58.200> from

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
sound is coming from further away from

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
sound is coming from further away from
you<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> more<00:01:58.799> separation<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.909> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you the more separation there is so it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
you the more separation there is so it
might<00:02:00.119> sound<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.869> guitar<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.290> back

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
might sound like the guitar is back

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.200 
might sound like the guitar is back
there<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> drums<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:02.579> over<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the bass is over there and the vocals

the bass is over there and the vocals
are<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.420> immersive

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
are up there it can be really immersive

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.940 
are up there it can be really immersive
and<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.020> pretty<00:02:07.170> cool<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> another<00:02:07.710> thing

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and that's pretty cool and another thing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
and that's pretty cool and another thing
that<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.220> considered<00:02:08.640> either<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> pro<00:02:09.300> or

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that can be considered either a pro or

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.080 
that can be considered either a pro or
con<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.080> real<00:02:10.860> world<00:02:11.129> sound<00:02:11.489> gets<00:02:11.760> mixed

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
con is that real world sound gets mixed

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
con is that real world sound gets mixed
in<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.690> audio<00:02:12.989> sound<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
in with your audio sound so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.980 
in with your audio sound so
and<00:02:13.590> back<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.400> room<00:02:14.700> noise<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.270> opposed

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and back you get room noise as opposed

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.960 
and back you get room noise as opposed
to<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.440> totally<00:02:16.800> silent<00:02:17.040> isolated<00:02:17.760> noise

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to just a totally silent isolated noise

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.330 
to just a totally silent isolated noise
from<00:02:18.120> closed<00:02:18.390> back<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.020> you'll<00:02:19.260> feel<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
from closed back so you'll feel like you

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.010 
from closed back so you'll feel like you
can<00:02:20.490> snap<00:02:20.790> along<00:02:21.030> with<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.300> music<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.780> hear

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
can snap along with the music and hear

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.870 
can snap along with the music and hear
yourself<00:02:22.440> snapping<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.850> a

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
yourself snapping you can have a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.310 
yourself snapping you can have a
conversation<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.630> person<00:02:24.900> next<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
conversation with the person next to you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.290 
conversation with the person next to you
as<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.680> they're<00:02:25.860> sitting<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> room<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
as if they're sitting in the room and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.090 
as if they're sitting in the room and
they<00:02:27.570> can't<00:02:27.840> hear<00:02:28.080> your<00:02:28.260> music<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.920> can

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
they can't hear your music but you can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
they can't hear your music but you can
still<00:02:29.280> hear<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.000> talk<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.480> it's

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
still hear them if they talk to you it's

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.090 
still hear them if they talk to you it's
pretty<00:02:30.810> interesting<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.860> could<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
pretty interesting again that could be a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.520 
pretty interesting again that could be a
pro<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.760> con<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> real<00:02:33.690> downside<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.260> open

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
pro or con but the real downside of open

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.100 
pro or con but the real downside of open
back<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:34.950> definitely<00:02:35.700> sound<00:02:36.120> leak<00:02:36.420> because

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
back is definitely sound leak because

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.390 
back is definitely sound leak because
there's<00:02:37.290> no<00:02:37.410> barrier<00:02:37.770> between<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.130> inside

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
there's no barrier between the inside

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.890 
there's no barrier between the inside
and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.550> outside<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.209> vibration<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and the outside the vibration of the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.140 
and the outside the vibration of the
diaphragm<00:02:40.410> pushes<00:02:40.650> audio<00:02:41.130> both<00:02:41.400> inward<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
diaphragm pushes audio both inward and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
diaphragm pushes audio both inward and
outward<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.740> if<00:02:44.070> someone's<00:02:44.490> sitting<00:02:44.730> next<00:02:44.850> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
outward so if someone's sitting next to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.340 
outward so if someone's sitting next to
you<00:02:45.150> it'll<00:02:45.390> sound<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.630> you're<00:02:45.870> wearing<00:02:46.020> mini

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
you it'll sound like you're wearing mini

you it'll sound like you're wearing mini
speakers<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.010> head<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.310> something

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.070 
speakers on your head or something
they'll<00:02:47.700> ibly<00:02:48.000> hear<00:02:48.300> everything<00:02:48.959> you're

they'll ibly hear everything you're

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.930 
they'll ibly hear everything you're
listening<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.770> studio<00:02:50.070> or<00:02:50.160> alone<00:02:50.700> this

listening to in a studio or alone this
might<00:02:51.090> not<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.270> such<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> big<00:02:51.810> deal<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.470> if

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
might not be such a big deal but if
