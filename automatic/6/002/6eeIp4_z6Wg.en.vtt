the secondary colored laces which match
the<00:02:43.790> sheer<00:02:44.300> are<00:02:44.420> great<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.990> way<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.200> don't

the sheer are great that way you don't

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.900 
the sheer are great that way you don't
have<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.590> chase<00:02:45.860> them<00:02:46.040> down<00:02:46.100> if<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.550> decide

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
have to chase them down if you decide

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.860 
have to chase them down if you decide
you're<00:02:47.090> gonna<00:02:47.180> go<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.140> color

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you're gonna go with just that color

perfect match already set up which we

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.300 
perfect match already set up which we
should<00:02:53.510> see<00:02:54.020> with<00:02:54.170> syndicate<00:02:54.650> style<00:02:54.950> shoes

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
should see with syndicate style shoes

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.730 
should see with syndicate style shoes
because<00:02:55.820> they're<00:02:56.060> more<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.570> elite<00:02:56.990> style

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
I wasn't happy with a couple of the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.250 
I wasn't happy with a couple of the
sellers<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> saw<00:03:01.670> who<00:03:02.600> took<00:03:02.630> their<00:03:02.990> pairs

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
sellers that I saw who took their pairs

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.460 
sellers that I saw who took their pairs
and<00:03:03.530> rather<00:03:03.680> than<00:03:03.920> selling<00:03:04.340> them<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.640> shop

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and rather than selling them at the shop

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
and rather than selling them at the shop
took<00:03:06.470> him<00:03:06.590> straight<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:07.040> ebay<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.700> think<00:03:08.210> that

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
took him straight to ebay I think that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.380 
took him straight to ebay I think that
when<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.830> van's<00:03:10.100> allows<00:03:10.460> syndicate<00:03:11.090> dealers

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
when the van's allows syndicate dealers

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.950 
when the van's allows syndicate dealers

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
as an elite type operation to sell they

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.480 
as an elite type operation to sell they
shouldn't<00:03:15.350> go<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.500> ebay<00:03:15.920> they<00:03:16.100> should<00:03:16.310> go<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
shouldn't go to ebay they should go to
