00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
digital camera that I'm recording with

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.570 
digital camera that I'm recording with
but<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.440> rusted<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.680> cracked<00:02:18.370> yeah<00:02:19.320> um

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580

don't<00:02:21.580> even<00:02:21.640> ask<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.210> think<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.840> sweat

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
don't even ask I think it's just a sweat

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.710 
don't even ask I think it's just a sweat
and<00:02:23.490> just<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.580> sweat<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> fact<00:02:25.240> I've<00:02:25.390> had<00:02:25.570> it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and just a sweat in the fact I've had it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
for six years um I guess it just must

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.860 
for six years um I guess it just must
have<00:02:28.870> got<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.130> got<00:02:30.640> rusty<00:02:31.270> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
