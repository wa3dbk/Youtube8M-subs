00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
fourth share of power now that I've been

fourth share of power now that I've been
racing<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.519> two-stroke<00:01:01.939> for<00:01:02.119> the<00:01:02.180> past

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630

season but I feel like I'm pretty
qualified<00:01:05.869> to<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.319> this<00:01:06.470> review<00:01:06.649> because<00:01:06.920> I've

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
qualified to do this review because I've

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.980 
qualified to do this review because I've
I've<00:01:09.350> written<00:01:09.850> both<00:01:10.850> bikes<00:01:11.149> at<00:01:11.420> least<00:01:11.600> 60

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
I've written both bikes at least 60

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.590 
I've written both bikes at least 60
hours<00:01:12.289> each<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.850> I've<00:01:13.850> got<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> lot<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.210> time<00:01:14.420> on

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
hours each and I've got a lot of time on

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.809 
hours each and I've got a lot of time on
both<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.840> them<00:01:14.929> so<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.350> I've<00:01:16.130> raced<00:01:16.429> them<00:01:16.640> both

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
both of them so and I've raced them both

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.440 
both of them so and I've raced them both
a<00:01:17.090> whole<00:01:17.270> lot<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.610> not<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:19.819> practice<00:01:20.000> tracks

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
a whole lot so not just practice tracks

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.660 
a whole lot so not just practice tracks
not<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:21.220> goofing<00:01:22.220> around<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:22.580> I've

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
not just goofing around but I've

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.059 
not just goofing around but I've
actually<00:01:22.759> raced<00:01:23.149> them<00:01:23.360> both<00:01:23.600> almost<00:01:24.590> equally

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
actually raced them both almost equally

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.990 
actually raced them both almost equally
and<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:26.679> feel<00:01:27.679> like<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.920> helps<00:01:28.069> me<00:01:28.280> out<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.580> do

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
and I feel like that helps me out to do

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.139 
and I feel like that helps me out to do
this<00:01:29.119> shootout<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.799> track<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.399> going<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.940> be

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
this shootout this track is going to be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.149 
this shootout this track is going to be
kind<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.810> short<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.409> don't<00:01:33.830> think<00:01:33.950> it's<00:01:34.069> going

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
kind of short I don't think it's going

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.919 
kind of short I don't think it's going
to<00:01:34.220> be<00:01:34.340> particularly<00:01:35.000> biased<00:01:35.450> towards<00:01:35.750> either

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
to be particularly biased towards either

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.450 
to be particularly biased towards either
by<00:01:36.110> bus<00:01:36.380> I'm<00:01:36.560> really<00:01:36.770> comfortable<00:01:37.069> here<00:01:37.340> I've

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
by bus I'm really comfortable here I've

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.090 
by bus I'm really comfortable here I've
written<00:01:37.579> here<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> lot<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.950> there's<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.070> a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
written here a lot so there's not a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.639 
written here a lot so there's not a
whole<00:01:40.280> lot<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.630> other<00:01:41.630> variables<00:01:42.140> besides<00:01:42.320> the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
whole lot of other variables besides the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.280 
whole lot of other variables besides the
bikes

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.920 

so<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.060> results<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.599> in<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:17.690> been<00:03:17.900> a

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
so the results are in and it's been a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.240 
so the results are in and it's been a
pretty<00:03:18.470> big<00:03:18.709> surprise

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
pretty big surprise

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.589 
pretty big surprise
I<00:03:20.650> was<00:03:22.180> consistently<00:03:24.370> at<00:03:25.370> least<00:03:25.849> 2<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.360> 3

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
I was consistently at least 2 to 3

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.949 
I was consistently at least 2 to 3
seconds<00:03:26.989> faster<00:03:27.700> per<00:03:28.700> lap<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.330> 350<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.340> a

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
seconds faster per lap on the 350 and a

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.059 
seconds faster per lap on the 350 and a
little<00:03:32.959> course<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.379> was<00:03:33.410> doing<00:03:33.709> was<00:03:33.830> only

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
little course that I was doing was only

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.110 
little course that I was doing was only
about<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.310> minute<00:03:34.519> long<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:37.519> 350<00:03:37.940> was<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
about a minute long and the 350 was the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.390 
about a minute long and the 350 was the
only<00:03:38.299> one<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.599> was<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.980> was<00:03:40.099> able<00:03:40.280> to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
only one that I was that was able to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.710 
only one that I was that was able to
break<00:03:40.579> under<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:40.970> minute<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:43.540> don't<00:03:44.540> know

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
break under a minute and I don't know

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.309 
break under a minute and I don't know
it's<00:03:44.870> pretty<00:03:44.989> surprising<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:47.200> wasn't<00:03:48.200> really

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
it's pretty surprising I wasn't really

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.190 
it's pretty surprising I wasn't really
expecting<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.950> but<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:50.420> thing<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:50.629> can<00:03:50.840> say<00:03:50.870> is

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
expecting it but one thing I can say is

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.160 
expecting it but one thing I can say is
the<00:03:51.379> 350<00:03:51.799> tires<00:03:52.040> me<00:03:52.250> out<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> lot<00:03:52.579> more<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.170> I

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the 350 tires me out a lot more and I

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.210 
the 350 tires me out a lot more and I
don't<00:03:54.319> know<00:03:54.440> if<00:03:54.500> that's<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:54.680> because<00:03:55.040> I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
don't know if that's just because I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.619 
don't know if that's just because I
haven't<00:03:55.400> been<00:03:55.579> riding<00:03:55.760> at<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.090> season<00:03:56.450> much

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
haven't been riding at this season much

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.869 
haven't been riding at this season much
and<00:03:56.900> just<00:03:57.829> not<00:03:58.010> used<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.430> ever<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:58.700> really

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
and just not used to it ever it's really

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.849 
and just not used to it ever it's really
just<00:03:58.970> because<00:03:59.269> it's<00:03:59.420> heavy<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.840> mean<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.709> does

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
just because it's heavy I mean it does

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.650 
just because it's heavy I mean it does
feel<00:04:01.190> heavy<00:04:01.579> but<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:03.260> tracks<00:04:03.709> so<00:04:04.310> well

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
feel heavy but it it tracks so well

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.140 
feel heavy but it it tracks so well
coming<00:04:05.660> out<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.989> corners<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:06.940> like<00:04:07.940> there's

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
coming out of corners and like there's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.360 
coming out of corners and like there's
as<00:04:08.540> you've<00:04:09.260> seen<00:04:09.590> in<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.799> GoPro<00:04:10.069> videos

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
as you've seen in the GoPro videos

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.550 
as you've seen in the GoPro videos
there's<00:04:10.579> like<00:04:10.760> some<00:04:11.390> really<00:04:11.750> abrupt<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.319> hills

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
there's like some really abrupt up hills

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.589 
there's like some really abrupt up hills
and<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.890> was<00:04:13.090> where<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.180> four-stroke

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
and that was where the four-stroke

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.879 
and that was where the four-stroke
really<00:04:14.930> shined<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:16.039> two-stroke<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.639> felt<00:04:16.940> was

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
really shined the two-stroke I felt was

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.500 
really shined the two-stroke I felt was
more<00:04:18.889> nimble<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.489> some<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.820> tighter<00:04:20.060> areas

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
more nimble in some of the tighter areas

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.500 
more nimble in some of the tighter areas
but<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.799> lost<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.669> lost<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.940> advantage<00:04:23.360> when

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
but it lost it lost the advantage when

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.150 
but it lost it lost the advantage when
it<00:04:23.630> came<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.960> accelerating<00:04:24.620> out<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> corners

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
it came to accelerating out of corners

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.219 
it came to accelerating out of corners
and<00:04:25.310> stuff<00:04:25.490> like<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.720> guess<00:04:27.080> that's

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
and stuff like that and I guess that's

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.190 
and stuff like that and I guess that's
where<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.770> lost<00:04:28.520> all<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.849> time<00:04:29.200> pretty

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
where I lost all the time pretty

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.650 
where I lost all the time pretty
surprising<00:04:30.650> considering<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:32.060> amount<00:04:32.510> of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
surprising considering the amount of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.129 
surprising considering the amount of
time<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.110> I've<00:04:33.229> had<00:04:33.320> on<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.560> 250<00:04:34.010> lately<00:04:34.430> but

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
time that I've had on the 250 lately but

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.660 
time that I've had on the 250 lately but
that's<00:04:36.139> why<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.349> did<00:04:36.560> this<00:04:36.680> test

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.860 

okay<00:04:43.670> now<00:04:43.910> I'm<00:04:44.030> gonna<00:04:44.150> talk<00:04:44.420> about<00:04:44.450> how<00:04:44.840> I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
okay now I'm gonna talk about how I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.630 
okay now I'm gonna talk about how I
tested<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.530> bikes<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.070> how<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.190> got<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> lot<00:04:46.610> of

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
tested the bikes and how I got a lot of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.140 
tested the bikes and how I got a lot of
times<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.330> gave<00:04:47.960> myself<00:04:48.200> two<00:04:48.950> laps<00:04:49.310> on<00:04:49.850> each

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
times I gave myself two laps on each

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.930 
times I gave myself two laps on each
bike<00:04:50.540> before<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.620> went<00:04:51.920> out<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.160> did<00:04:52.280> four<00:04:52.670> lap

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
bike before I went out and did four lap

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.830 
bike before I went out and did four lap
sprints<00:04:54.670> during<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.760> four<00:04:55.970> laps<00:04:56.150> Springs<00:04:56.540> my

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
sprints during the four laps Springs my

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.390 
sprints during the four laps Springs my
mom<00:04:57.050> was<00:04:57.290> taking<00:04:57.500> left<00:04:57.980> her<00:04:58.420> iPhone<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.800> um

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
mom was taking left her iPhone so um

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.790 
mom was taking left her iPhone so um
but<00:05:01.850> she<00:05:02.030> had<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.450> know<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.870> really<00:05:03.140> good<00:05:03.380> start

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
but she had you know a really good start

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.660 
but she had you know a really good start
and<00:05:04.190> stop<00:05:04.460> point<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:06.100> but<00:05:07.100> like<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.460> said<00:05:07.610> I

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
and stop point and but like I said I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.820 
and stop point and but like I said I
gave<00:05:07.820> myself<00:05:07.970> two<00:05:08.360> laps<00:05:08.570> each<00:05:08.930> time<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.500> got<00:05:09.710> on

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
gave myself two laps each time I got on

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.340 
gave myself two laps each time I got on
a<00:05:09.860> different<00:05:10.160> bike<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.670> gave<00:05:11.480> myself<00:05:11.660> two<00:05:12.110> laps

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
a different bike I gave myself two laps

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.960 
a different bike I gave myself two laps
of<00:05:12.590> getting<00:05:12.830> used<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.430> then<00:05:13.550> did<00:05:13.730> for

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
of getting used to it and then did for

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.010 
of getting used to it and then did for
Sprint<00:05:14.300> laps<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.950> I<00:05:16.400> mean<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:17.120> was<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.990> same

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
Sprint laps so I mean it was the same

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.170 
Sprint laps so I mean it was the same
for<00:05:18.500> each<00:05:18.560> bike<00:05:18.830> there<00:05:19.160> weren't<00:05:19.370> no<00:05:19.790> bike<00:05:20.000> was

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
for each bike there weren't no bike was

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.600 
for each bike there weren't no bike was
given<00:05:20.540> more<00:05:21.140> time<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.830> 350

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
given more time so the the the 350

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.800 
given more time so the the the 350
clearly<00:05:29.060> won<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.950> I'm<00:05:31.300> really<00:05:32.300> surprised<00:05:32.690> by

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
clearly won and I'm really surprised by

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.830 
clearly won and I'm really surprised by
that<00:05:32.990> as<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.290> talked<00:05:33.590> about<00:05:33.650> before<00:05:33.800> but<00:05:34.840> one

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
that as I talked about before but one

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.659 
that as I talked about before but one
thing<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.080> will<00:05:36.290> say<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:36.800> if<00:05:37.280> we<00:05:37.430> could<00:05:37.580> do

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
thing I will say is that if we could do

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.340 
thing I will say is that if we could do
tired<00:05:37.910> me<00:05:38.180> out<00:05:38.210> more<00:05:38.510> which<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.900> already<00:05:39.020> said

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
tired me out more which I already said

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.890 
tired me out more which I already said
and<00:05:40.960> previous<00:05:41.960> stuff<00:05:42.230> but<00:05:42.440> uh<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:43.419> think<00:05:44.419> that's

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
and previous stuff but uh I think that's

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.360 
and previous stuff but uh I think that's
kind<00:05:45.290> of<00:05:45.380> just<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:45.860> haven't<00:05:46.160> been

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
kind of just because I haven't been

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.750 
kind of just because I haven't been
riding<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:47.020> but<00:05:48.020> I<00:05:48.260> do<00:05:48.620> think<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:49.040> 350<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.580> not

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
riding it but I do think the 350 is not

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.670 
riding it but I do think the 350 is not
going<00:05:49.970> to<00:05:50.090> be<00:05:50.150> better<00:05:50.360> all<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.900> time<00:05:51.050> just

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
going to be better all of the time just

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.300 
going to be better all of the time just
some<00:05:51.919> of<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.100> time<00:05:53.050> for<00:05:54.050> long<00:05:54.320> races<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:55.040> really

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
some of the time for long races I really

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.740 
some of the time for long races I really
do<00:05:55.460> think<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:55.790> those<00:05:55.940> who<00:05:56.000> stroke<00:05:56.479> is

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
do think that those who stroke is

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.710 
do think that those who stroke is
sometimes<00:05:57.590> a<00:05:57.740> better<00:05:57.919> choice<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.970> mean

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
sometimes a better choice and I mean

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.060 
sometimes a better choice and I mean
obviously<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:00.200> think<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.590> that's<00:06:00.800> why<00:06:00.950> I'm

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
obviously I think that that's why I'm

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.840 
obviously I think that that's why I'm
racing<00:06:01.669> one<00:06:01.820> currently<00:06:02.240> but<00:06:03.010> yeah<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.130> 350<00:06:04.760> is

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
racing one currently but yeah a 350 is

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.240 
racing one currently but yeah a 350 is
still<00:06:05.030> a<00:06:05.060> great<00:06:05.270> bike<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:05.890> if<00:06:06.890> you're<00:06:07.220> a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
still a great bike and if you're a

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.400 
still a great bike and if you're a
four-stroke<00:06:07.940> rider<00:06:08.180> then<00:06:08.450> ride<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.780> 350<00:06:09.290> if

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
four-stroke rider then ride the 350 if

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.750 
four-stroke rider then ride the 350 if
you're<00:06:09.590> a<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.800> strip<00:06:10.040> rider<00:06:10.250> then<00:06:10.460> ride<00:06:10.610> the
