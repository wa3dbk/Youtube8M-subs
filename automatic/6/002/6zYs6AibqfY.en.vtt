being<00:01:52.140> made<00:01:52.260> almost<00:01:52.770> daily<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.550> now<00:01:53.750> you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
being made almost daily even now you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.710 
being made almost daily even now you
will<00:01:54.930> find<00:01:55.230> that<00:01:55.350> once<00:01:56.220> again<00:01:56.580> your<00:01:57.270> inner<00:01:57.480> and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
will find that once again your inner and

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.190 
will find that once again your inner and
outer<00:01:57.870> worlds<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.650> parallel

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
outer worlds will be parallel

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.679 
outer worlds will be parallel
as<00:02:00.259> humans<00:02:00.680> also<00:02:00.920> many<00:02:01.820> inner<00:02:02.060> breakthroughs

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
as humans also many inner breakthroughs

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.870 
as humans also many inner breakthroughs
are<00:02:02.869> already<00:02:03.259> being<00:02:03.500> made<00:02:03.590> almost<00:02:04.130> daily<00:02:04.579> even

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
are already being made almost daily even

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.050 
are already being made almost daily even
now<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:06.110> don't<00:02:06.380> often<00:02:06.590> hear<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.189> yet<00:02:07.430> but

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
now you don't often hear of it yet but

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.320 
now you don't often hear of it yet but
soon<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.509> will<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.950> meantime<00:02:10.120> be<00:02:11.120> your

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
proportions of a tidal wave we see that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440 
proportions of a tidal wave we see that
