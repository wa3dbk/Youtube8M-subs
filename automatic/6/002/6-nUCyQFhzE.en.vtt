00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello everyone, as you probably know, we 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 were among the first in the world to whom 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
 managed to live to see take a picture 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 white meizu mx2 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 here i have a black sample and white in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 box acquaintance with white mx2 happened 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.600
 june and showed it to us 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.480
 CEO of the company within 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.119
 trips to the factory and 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 an interview on the new meizu which will be released 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.510
 In the fall, the telephone begins to flow into 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.239
 sale and came to us where is my sample 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 let's show the box behind the inscription 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 meizu mx2 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.079
 model m 040 for car white 16 gigabyte 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.649
 box damaged during transport 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 such here we have a courier but the contents 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.510
 fortunately did not suffer let me take off 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.309
 cover and show what's inside 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.149
 after 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.129
 I will tell about differences from black weight 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.809
 inside instruction in Russian as 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.260
 start work you need to remove the cover 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:14.970
 insert a sim sim card on the right 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 charging compartment european plug 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.770
 the output of her 1 amp next comes the book 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 I really like this design 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.650
 set 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.140
 such a thick book is heavy 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 weighty main chips here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.329
 devices about the screen pro OSes about 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 materials 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.659
 behind which is a pencil case 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 additional accessories and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.320
 accessories 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.439
 hard to get 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.439
 here he is 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:03.259
 all white this mediators in order 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:07.899
 to remove the cable cover long 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:13.209
 everywhere microusb is very necessary and useful 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:20.690
 the subject of the household phone lies 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:27.459
 compartment in the book under him a guide to 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:31.190
 operation in Russian course 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.560
 here are the mini sindo trim stickers 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.650
 state micro sim 2 pieces 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 in reserve 1 inclusion happened 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.680
 fast enough 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.730
 let's look at the differences white mx2 without 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 peeled off the films 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.400
 in order not to damage anything when 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.400
 transportation can take them off 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.180
 and now 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.180
 neatly 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.480
 let's see now the difference is they 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.180
 there is the first thing that catches your eye 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.880
 sensor hole 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.850
 lighting and distance from black 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.560
 almost invisible they are holes 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:30.020
 for the camera a little overflow pay 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.080
 attention to the difference in the lattices 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.140
 conversational dynamics in black is 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.140
 when such a thick plate and white 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.400
 thin lattice stylish difference 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.440
 there are plugs under the gps case with black 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.470
 modifications it has many users 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.370
 clambered here you see me here 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.560
 a little paint peeled off just red 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.810
 plastic about white modification 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.850
 there is no need for paint 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.850
 silicone insert translucent 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:12.140
 the ring of black is better expressed in white 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.140
 she is not so striking 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.140
 Further, the main difference is well apart from 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.280
 own front panel it 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.220
 metal frame around the perimeter of 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.920
 black is painted metal 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:35.180
 white metal bezel is not painted and 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.180
 just so polished 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.640
 metal detail is very nice on 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 touch and she does not pour in no case 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.560
 scientists models some users 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.600
 there are chips are they when not very 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.480
 neatly washed neatly handled not 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.870
 understandable if I notice this here 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.230
 here are a few chips at the bottom 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.760
 white model cheekbones excluded because 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.900
 it's just here 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.910
 metal if it appears 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.389
 something is not chipped paint but just 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.539
 dents but it will be no problem 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.240
 production your problems because you 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.669
 appearance of very neat users 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.830
 the last difference is probably the last 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:29.210
 I can judge so much this color 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:33.160
 loudspeaker grill black black 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.810
 and the white is white, that is, the white cap 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.699
 almost completely off the white model 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.949
 almost completely notices the white behind 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.430
 except for you up to the camera but apparently 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.750
 white 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.840
 no way can be done otherwise the light will be 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:52.760
 getting on the sensor will be very bad 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.699
 get a photograph also me 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.820
 it seems that the cover is in the white version on the left 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.970
 A bit whiter than the black version but 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.099
 I have a black version of it from the earliest 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.800
 first batches therefore I do not exclude that 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.630
 on the production of the cap was over time 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.599
 somehow modified as now in 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:15.610
 fresh black versions and the same light 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:18.169
 and I noticed the next moment 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:24.280
 microphones in the white version they 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.280
 light and above and below 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.500
 actually here is a white sample 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.650
 hardware characteristics they have 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.389
 are identical and all the difference is obtained in 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.110
 design 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:41.260
 see what is better for you about how you 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.710
 fix 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.710
 it's in front 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.080
 left end 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:07:04.860
 top right bottom and back and repeat 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.319
 that the white version will appear in Russia in 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.970
 limited quantities and owners 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:16.240
 This device will have some 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.430
 such a limited gadget thanks for
