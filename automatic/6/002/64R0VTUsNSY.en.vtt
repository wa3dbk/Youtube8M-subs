supercar

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.620 

so<00:00:24.980> we<00:00:25.070> have<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.189> look<00:00:25.310> inside<00:00:25.519> our<00:00:25.849> booth<00:00:26.060> it's

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
so we have a look inside our booth it's

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.060 
so we have a look inside our booth it's
it's<00:00:27.140> pretty<00:00:27.289> empty<00:00:27.439> you<00:00:27.650> can<00:00:27.800> fit<00:00:27.949> the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
it's pretty empty you can fit the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.150 
it's pretty empty you can fit the
groceries<00:00:28.400> in<00:00:28.520> it<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.449> there's<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.720> 75<00:00:30.380> litre

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
groceries in it so there's a 75 litre

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.549 
groceries in it so there's a 75 litre
fuel<00:00:31.640> bladder<00:00:32.029> under<00:00:32.480> there<00:00:32.599> 75<00:00:33.140> liter<00:00:33.379> is

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
fuel bladder under there 75 liter is

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.260 
fuel bladder under there 75 liter is
regulated<00:00:34.160> by<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.340> sport<00:00:34.699> so<00:00:34.879> everyone<00:00:35.150> has

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
regulated by the sport so everyone has

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.000 
regulated by the sport so everyone has
to<00:00:35.300> have<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.570> same<00:00:35.809> amount<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.710> same

battery that's actually won us a few
races<00:00:52.339> you'll<00:00:53.000> also<00:00:53.150> see<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.170> brake

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
races you'll also see that the brake

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.369 
races you'll also see that the brake
water<00:00:54.920> tank<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:56.059> front<00:00:56.359> brakes<00:00:56.660> run<00:00:57.020> that<00:00:57.199> hot

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
water tank the front brakes run that hot

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.959 
water tank the front brakes run that hot
that<00:00:57.590> we<00:00:57.680> have<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.949> spray<00:00:58.219> water<00:00:58.460> on<00:00:58.699> them<00:00:58.850> to

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
that we have to spray water on them to

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.910 
that we have to spray water on them to
try<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.270> drop<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.989> temperature<00:01:00.350> now<00:01:00.530> it

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
try and drop the temperature now it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920 
try and drop the temperature now it
doesn't<00:01:01.190> do<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.399> lot<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.120> takes<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.840> edge

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
doesn't do a lot but it takes the edge

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.630 
doesn't do a lot but it takes the edge
off<00:01:03.079> them<00:01:03.230> if<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.859> if<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.160> come<00:01:04.339> around<00:01:04.430> and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
off them if you if you come around and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.279 
off them if you if you come around and
look<00:01:04.850> right<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.239> here<00:01:05.390> you'll<00:01:05.570> see<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:05.960> valve

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
look right in here you'll see this valve

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.370 
look right in here you'll see this valve
sitting<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:06.830> top<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.009> filler<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:08.380> obviously

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
sitting on top of filler to obviously

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.840 
sitting on top of filler to obviously
when<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.649> use<00:01:09.770> fuel<00:01:10.100> you're<00:01:10.250> sucking<00:01:10.580> out<00:01:10.700> out

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
when you use fuel you're sucking out out

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.820 
when you use fuel you're sucking out out
of<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.149> bag<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.539> you<00:01:12.140> have<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.410> replace<00:01:12.679> it

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
of the bag and you have to replace it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.230 
of the bag and you have to replace it
with<00:01:12.920> air<00:01:13.039> so<00:01:13.220> that's<00:01:13.340> your<00:01:13.490> valve<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:13.910> let<00:01:13.970> air

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
with air so that's your valve to let air

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880 
with air so that's your valve to let air
in<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.780> rollover<00:01:15.140> valve<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.770> if

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
in but it's a rollover valve so that if

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.639 
in but it's a rollover valve so that if
the<00:01:16.070> car<00:01:16.310> rolls<00:01:16.970> over<00:01:17.240> fuel<00:01:18.200> won't<00:01:18.440> be

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
the car rolls over fuel won't be

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.380 
the car rolls over fuel won't be
spilling<00:01:19.130> out<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.490> valve<00:01:19.759> if<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.210> walk

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
spilling out of that valve if you walk

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.510 
spilling out of that valve if you walk
to<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.600> side<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.140> car<00:01:21.380> when<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.130> look<00:01:22.369> in

to the side of the car when you look in
the<00:01:22.550> pit<00:01:22.789> stops<00:01:23.090> you'll<00:01:23.720> you'll<00:01:24.259> see<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.679> fuel

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the pit stops you'll you'll see the fuel

stat ones to vent we'll have a look at

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.690 
stat ones to vent we'll have a look at

the fuel rigs and the heads to see them

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.620 
the fuel rigs and the heads to see them
the<00:01:38.600> fuel<00:01:39.380> there's<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.890> restrictor<00:01:40.369> net<00:01:40.630> to

the fuel there's a restrictor net to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.450 
the fuel there's a restrictor net to
control<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.259> flow<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:42.680> don't<00:01:42.920> go<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.250> as

dangerous<00:01:46.549> enough<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.030> let<00:01:47.329> alone<00:01:47.360> with

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
dangerous enough as it is let alone with

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.880 
dangerous enough as it is let alone with
air<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.860> restricting<00:01:49.460> us

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.740 

so<00:01:52.890> over<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.250> we've<00:01:53.400> got<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.510> fewer

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so over here we've got that the fewer

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.720 
so over here we've got that the fewer
existence<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.440> put<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> e85<00:01:56.040> into<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
existence here we put the e85 into the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.140 
existence here we put the e85 into the
cars

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
cars

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.330 
cars
these<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.930> regulated<00:01:58.890> by<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> sports

these are regulated by the sports

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.310 
these are regulated by the sports
everyone<00:01:59.910> has<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> same<00:02:00.180> fuel<00:02:00.630> rigs<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.170> was

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
everyone has the same fuel rigs that was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320 
everyone has the same fuel rigs that was
after<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.860> started<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.580> fuel<00:02:02.820> rig<00:02:03.000> war

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
after we started a bit of a fuel rig war

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.270 
after we started a bit of a fuel rig war
a<00:02:03.360> few<00:02:03.480> years<00:02:03.840> ago<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.500> won<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> war<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
a few years ago we won the war two and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.790 
a few years ago we won the war two and
and<00:02:06.150> then<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.480> goes<00:02:06.660> into<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.050> head<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.350> we

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
and then it goes into your head as we

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.490 
and then it goes into your head as we
spoke<00:02:08.010> about<00:02:08.070> there's<00:02:08.850> one<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.930> your<00:02:10.050> fuel<00:02:10.290> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
spoke about there's one for your fuel in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.430 
spoke about there's one for your fuel in
and<00:02:10.680> one<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.280> vent<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.930> try<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.260> get

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and one for your vent we try and get

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.810 
and one for your vent we try and get
that<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.710> as<00:02:13.860> quick<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.130> possible<00:02:14.160> there's

the boys as safe as we can okay so we

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.140 
the boys as safe as we can okay so we
showed<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> fuel<00:02:38.190> filler<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
showed you the fuel filler so then the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.510 
showed you the fuel filler so then the
fuel<00:02:39.390> will<00:02:39.510> come<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.160> fuel<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.370> this

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
fuel will come in here fuel into this

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790 
fuel will come in here fuel into this
one<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:42.420> after<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.080> filling<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.590> the

one here after that one filling that the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.580 
one here after that one filling that the
bag<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.370> discussed<00:02:44.930> inside<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.140> bag<00:02:46.350> it's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
bag as we discussed inside the bag it's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.500 
bag as we discussed inside the bag it's
you<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.130> lift<00:02:47.700> pumps<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.209> pick<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you have lift pumps which will pick the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.300 
you have lift pumps which will pick the
fuel<00:02:48.720> up<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.959> take<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.590> fuel<00:02:49.830> pot<00:02:50.070> then

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
fuel up and take it to the fuel pot then

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.850 
fuel up and take it to the fuel pot then
on<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> engine<00:02:50.790> there<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.510> also<00:02:52.020> anti

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
on to the engine there is also anti

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
on to the engine there is also anti
explosion<00:02:53.430> foam<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> lot<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> people<00:02:54.420> think

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
explosion foam a lot of people think

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.030 
explosion foam a lot of people think
that<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.900> foam<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.380> actually<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.739> there<00:02:55.860> to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that that foam is actually in there to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.949 
that that foam is actually in there to
stop<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.550> sloshing<00:02:56.790> that's<00:02:57.420> not<00:02:57.630> its<00:02:57.780> main

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
stop the sloshing that's not its main

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.110 
stop the sloshing that's not its main
purpose<00:02:58.170> its<00:02:58.440> main<00:02:58.620> purpose<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.520> take<00:02:59.970> up

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
purpose its main purpose is to take up

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.030 
purpose its main purpose is to take up
the<00:03:00.239> airspace<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> doesn't<00:03:01.170> explode<00:03:01.230> if

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the airspace so it doesn't explode if

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.740 
the airspace so it doesn't explode if
you<00:03:02.250> drop<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.520> match<00:03:02.760> into<00:03:03.090> an<00:03:03.180> open<00:03:03.480> tank

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you drop a match into an open tank

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
you drop a match into an open tank
without<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.500> phone<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.370> big<00:03:05.760> whooshing

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
without the phone it will big whooshing

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.420 
without the phone it will big whooshing
up<00:03:06.239> she<00:03:06.390> goes<00:03:06.570> if<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.260> are<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.010> with<00:03:08.400> a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
up she goes if you are with a with a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070 
up she goes if you are with a with a
nice<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:08.880> explosion<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.660> do<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.930> with

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
nice little explosion if you do it with

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.960 
nice little explosion if you do it with
the<00:03:10.230> foam<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.590> there<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:11.160> will<00:03:11.340> obviously<00:03:11.519> burn

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the foam in there it will obviously burn

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.630 
the foam in there it will obviously burn
its<00:03:12.180> fuel<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.050> won't<00:03:13.260> explodes<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.040> it

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
its fuel but it won't explodes so it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.250 
its fuel but it won't explodes so it
does<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> lot<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.150> than<00:03:15.540> than<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.930> think<00:03:16.110> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
does a lot more than than you think it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.660 
does a lot more than than you think it
would<00:03:16.790> sort<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.850> fuel<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:19.050> also<00:03:19.230> have<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.670> carbon

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
would sort of fuel we also have a carbon

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.970 
would sort of fuel we also have a carbon
lid<00:03:20.880> here<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.360> help<00:03:21.840> keep<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.500> capacity

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
lid here to help keep the capacity

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.800 
lid here to help keep the capacity
constant<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.820> there's<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.300> bit<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> safety

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
constant and there's a bit of a safety

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.690 
constant and there's a bit of a safety
barrier<00:03:25.110> there's<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.830> crash<00:03:26.100> box<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.670> for

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
barrier there's a crash box here for

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.140 
barrier there's a crash box here for
four<00:03:27.390> rear<00:03:27.660> crashes<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:29.100> think<00:03:29.640> there's<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> bit

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
four rear crashes I think there's a bit

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.390 
four rear crashes I think there's a bit
of<00:03:30.239> work<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> pipeline<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.980> make<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.370> a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
of work in the pipeline to make that a

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.449 
of work in the pipeline to make that a
bit<00:03:32.580> more<00:03:32.730> substantial<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:35.310> actually

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
bit more substantial so that it actually

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.280 
bit more substantial so that it actually
does<00:03:35.760> something<00:03:35.910> more<00:03:36.239> than<00:03:36.480> big<00:03:36.870> decorative

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
does something more than big decorative

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.190 
does something more than big decorative
so<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.830> fuel<00:03:38.100> out<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.690> tank

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
so the fuel out of the out of the tank

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.199 
so the fuel out of the out of the tank
will<00:03:40.470> go<00:03:40.650> our<00:03:41.010> fuel<00:03:41.370> pot<00:03:41.580> lives<00:03:41.940> underneath

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
will go our fuel pot lives underneath

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.240 
will go our fuel pot lives underneath
the<00:03:42.390> cast<00:03:42.630> centre<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.110> gravity<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.070> goes

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the cast centre of gravity so it goes

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.100 
the cast centre of gravity so it goes
into<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.580> that's<00:03:45.060> an<00:03:45.209> eight<00:03:45.390> liter<00:03:45.630> maximum

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
into that that's an eight liter maximum

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.630 
into that that's an eight liter maximum
that's<00:03:46.290> also<00:03:46.709> ruled<00:03:46.950> by<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.190> category

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
that's also ruled by the category

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.430 
that's also ruled by the category
obviously<00:03:48.090> pumped<00:03:48.690> along<00:03:48.900> underneath<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
obviously pumped along underneath the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.380 
obviously pumped along underneath the
car<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.860> try<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.220> keep<00:03:50.370> all<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.000> fuel<00:03:51.209> lines

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
car we try and keep all the fuel lines

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.120 
car we try and keep all the fuel lines
out<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.750> car<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.230> safety<00:03:52.590> reasons<00:03:52.920> once

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
out of the car for safety reasons once

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.240 
out of the car for safety reasons once
again<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:54.300> then<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.900> will<00:03:54.989> come<00:03:55.200> through<00:03:55.739> up

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
again and then it will come through up

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.400 
again and then it will come through up
through<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.670> bulkhead<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.330> enter<00:03:58.200> your

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
through a bulkhead and enter your

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.530 
through a bulkhead and enter your
engines<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.920> obviously<00:03:59.700> you've<00:04:00.209> seen<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
engines and obviously you've seen the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.930 
engines and obviously you've seen the
engines<00:04:00.810> before<00:04:00.930> into<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> fuel<00:04:01.980> rail<00:04:02.160> into

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
engines before into the fuel rail into
