00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.360
 already in early spring 2012 were 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.579
 Unusually many stinglings in the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.280
 to see Lake Constance 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:37.500
 with the beginning of the spawning season in may 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.500
 the good places are hotly contested 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 easily prepared male build 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.309
 Plants and seashell share a cave 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.290
 which is glued with a secret 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.500
 as soon as this is done try it 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.079
 by their striking red coloration of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.839
 attract female indicates a sting 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.960
 Directed left lady interest is that 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.960
 Male in a zigzag dance to the nest 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.130
 if the female part of her am 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:48.060
 nestrand has filed these of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 male in the nest tied up to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 fertilization, the male now squeezes 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.220
 completely in the nest and leaves it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.110
 the other side this second opening 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.110
 will be closed again later 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.320
 until the boys hatch it becomes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.660
 nest guarded and defended 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.460
 oxygen-rich water is regularly used 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.110
 Mosquito larvae tied in the cave 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.450
 Snails and crabs are a threat 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.910
 for the offspring and will be if 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.910
 possible kept out of reach 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.109
 + base become a danger 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.109
 as soon as I leave the nest 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.900
 seven to ten days after 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:46.870
 fertilization hatch, the young, the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:49.330
 first days you spend in nest two 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.900
 weeks full of stress make people 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.470
 prone to parasites like fish egl and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 carp lice some survive these 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.980
 not time 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 but not every nestbau and 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.710
 egg tray produces young stings 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.690
 even your own style destroys the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.730
 nests of competition from around 20 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.430
 nest I build from may to july 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.530
 I could only observe one at a time 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.530
 find single young stinglings
