00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.379
 One of our friends who are in 2008 raised the number 6 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.490
 i will continue 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 we just installed 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780
 the antivirus and faloon 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.729
 comfortable 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.389
 and now it goes we talk about a little 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.060
 applications that are free and very effective and very efficient that we are 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.210
 helping in the maintenance d joining us to keep it agile 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.310
 stable 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.439
 clean do not fill us with temporary the landfill this external sector 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.789
 then percent 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.600
 before entering to watch the programs let's look at the activation 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 let's have good in line with you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030
 percent entity in 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.510
 in total the previous one we saw how to highlight the icon of my pc in the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.269
 desktop we give you right click 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.630
 properties 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.920
 and we go home 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.350
 they are all 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.540
 and here at the bottom always tells us 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.500
 what trance Diaspora the acting automate what he would do 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 percent 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.079
 preciously if we plan 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.120
 or we can tell you 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 activate something in two now 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.170
 per cent I think here they are where it is that the mussona is not licensed if not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.930
 we put a serial munch during installation 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.960
 here we have 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.180
 percent chance to change 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.970
 I stayed like it would be the new 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 of windows 7 that arises peru com already we have it one is made windows 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.650
 in a car of the option to activate the vintage we are going to tell you that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530
 activate 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.440
 they say it can take a few minutes let's see how much 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 boston ma 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 very well perfect you see that you do not vote a message that the activation of this 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.990
 successful 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.879
 inmates appears immediately on 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.109
 wolf d microsoft genuine and here where we have the message that he had grown up 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.309
 what it is now appears to us 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.059
 the icon of 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.400
 genuine windows however with that that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.530
 as they say the first tutorial that is the version of rc 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.300
 i in a lifetime 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.300
 When roasting in the middle of next year, yes 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.919
 denim let's come to camps 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.019
 and in the bar 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.400
 write of the word feel a swing like windows 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.469
 winder 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.099
 for windows version and there we will see the windows version we have 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.949
 and here I said very well 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.209
 for blind and his show in two treaties that compilations and efficiency that what 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.249
 he says it's an act 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.509
 percent and copy evaluation 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.139
 i stretch 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.120
 and the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.959
 fail as I told you 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.519
 the first of March in 2010 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.759
 When I tell them, it expires 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:11.359
 there at the moment he starts giving us the warning and going off every 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.019
 the hours so he finally died 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.499
 stop working permanently 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.670
 but at that moment she would be 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.139
 let's say it also the procedure to authorize 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.029
 us in 2 7 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.079
 when they have already lassad 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.439
 well let's talk now a little bit about that strong maintenance to these programs well 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.119
 interesting that I think that I already have it not be that it also works very 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.859
 well in windows 7 already having seen tried one is 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.619
 if you have 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:46.259
 that originally was called joaquino de Kirchner means cleaner of 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.259
 10 you know what 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.869
 and it is a program that completely automates the cleaning of our 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.399
 system is excellent or very good 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.659
 eva mozas seven shots then you have dotcom and here is an option where 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.659
 says eta a gift of click here 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.859
 of the options that appear do not care a bit from the failed team 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.659
 good piece of equipment we see all versions all the history of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.839
 injuries here and always first that says above 

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.340
 whale one out 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.810
 download the latest version 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.409
 this we click here 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.609
 we download it 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.540
 iun 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.819
 a little programmate of this same company 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:27.390
 he has certainly explained 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.159
 very good is this 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.979
 distract him then we go to triple double out 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.599
 of frac to read dotcom with double efe 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.169
 and also it is exactly the same we say we give one out 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.290
 also from fael type the same as the previous program and the same here 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.680
 up is found 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.400
 the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.499
 graciela will learn 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.899
 operating city of the eei from first you will find the option of y 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.340
 salty good 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.370
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.749
 according to 2 7 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.650
 he showed his industry and everything that you download it puts in our documents 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:08.259
 in a folder that you have created that has been sent an out shoot downloads 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.210
 here we have the three climbers and if you want and in that stated 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.569
 outsourced ordiales commented on what is 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:16.289
 was the 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.999
 it's not necessarily a utility but I'm seeing who you report to 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.960
 utilities 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.449
 and it's a package that loves calais 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.409
 codec pack 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.749
 which is 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:31.360
 a package that is responsible for giving our system all the codecs of 

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:35.639
 video had and for having so that our system that in capacity 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.639
 to play all formats there is video since April ahmad mt 4 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.049
 nadal will be measured to those who are destined to the delivery of money from g in 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.740
 then we also saw that page with him 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.439
 from haiti dotcom 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.130
 and here on the left we click on a car 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.599
 that brings us to this window 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.380
 offers us several basic federation alternatives are darfur media 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.059
 per cent let's go he recommended that you lower your measure landau average 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:10.889
 loyo this window 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.990
 i here already presents the links to download the one I recommend this one 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.080
 second 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.619
 of choruses point ru 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.770
 the girl and tell her download this file that I have out which is 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.800
 kl kohout 505 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.259
 3 percent 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.379
 I'm going to show you how to do it and videos at that time I still get 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.389
 now with the god that I have around saved like these 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.389
 at this time all are assigned to 6 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.039
 so there will be the windows media player 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.400
 but there are going to be some formats that suddenly 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.800
 the windows media player could not support or for legal reasons or why not 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.860
 here in the necessary codec so much 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.099
 this package icons assemble your own player and I show you how to use them 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.099
 let's start with the yes I want and it's worth double click 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.879
 we tell him that they leave this one also ordered to install there and rope biomass 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:25.580
 operating system that we have 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.669
 let's see why 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.139
 next nth or here is a single shell 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.870
 I thought that this program differentiates what we have done so far if it goes 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.610
 to install in x86 fake programs 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.759
 this is a program at the forefront of their lives
