 Beta and her family go camping 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.089
 love to go camping 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:25.150
 we have arrived in George the store 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.939
 campaign when I was little you do not 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.670
 Worry, I'm an expert in 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.600
 monsters you think mom people the canvas 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.380

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.530
 Eaten 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 These pegs are for something, of course 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.579
 I forgot the pegs the labels 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.190
 hold the store 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:54.010
 it's already for me it was very big when 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.289
 It was small but if now it seems that 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.750
 shrunk that's because you've grown a 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.489
 little since you were little dad pig and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.329
 what has grown the most is the belly 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.880
 Daddy 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.520
 and speaking of bellies time to do the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.039
 Dinner 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.109
 you have to find firewood to make a 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.030
 bonfire pp 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.240
 george helps the potato itches to catch firewood 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:27.460
 for the bonfire 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:33.250
 under the sticks and all the more lands 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:37.420
 well enough is enough let's make a 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 super bonfire I'll turn it on 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.600
 we do not need matches for your heat 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.179
 advancing the xunta doubts I will do 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.149
 fire as formerly rubbing and 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.920
 rubbing these two sticks for daddy that 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.819
 is rubbing the two sticks for 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.819
 light the bonfire 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 when dad was missing he's almost there 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.970
 already 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.040
 it has been a piece of cake 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.040
 we can heat the tomato soup 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.230
 the sounds of nature are 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.680
 friends is the sound that the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 irons 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.230
 has been an owl look there is 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.380
 and what has been this noise and I do not know 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.000
 this roar is one of the best 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.720
 sounds of nature means that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.210
 you have to make 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.670
 I love tomato tapas for me 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.200
 as well 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.370
 now another of the sounds of the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 dad's nature 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.640

 It is cold 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.220
