the<00:02:31.600> reason<00:02:31.780> why<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> figured<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.380> was

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
the reason why I figured that was

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.780 
the reason why I figured that was
because<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.100> can<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.550> kind<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
because as you can see it's kind of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.500 
because as you can see it's kind of
tight<00:02:34.450> from<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.970> still<00:02:37.239> be

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
tight from here to there but I still be

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.759 
tight from here to there but I still be
able<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.720> put<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> business<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.410> here<00:02:38.440> if<00:02:38.680> I

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
able to put a business right here if I

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.740 
able to put a business right here if I
want<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.489> haven't<00:02:39.760> decided<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.150> yet<00:02:40.300> I

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
want so I haven't decided that yet I
