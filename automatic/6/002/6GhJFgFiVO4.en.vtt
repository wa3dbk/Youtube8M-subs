stand with a piece of paper that is cut

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.450 
stand with a piece of paper that is cut
into<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.420> proportion<00:00:17.109> of<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:18.699> dollar<00:00:20.460> so

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
into the proportion of any dollar so

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.149 
into the proportion of any dollar so
let's<00:00:22.300> get<00:00:22.449> started<00:00:23.730> now<00:00:24.929> you're<00:00:25.929> cut<00:00:26.109> out<00:00:26.159> and

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:27.159 
let's get started now you're cut out and

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.450 
let's get started now you're cut out and
your<00:00:27.550> dollar<00:00:27.730> bill<00:00:27.970> should<00:00:28.720> line<00:00:28.929> up<00:00:29.460> pretty

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
your dollar bill should line up pretty

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.130 
your dollar bill should line up pretty
much<00:00:30.929> exactly<00:00:31.929> what<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:33.280> do<00:00:33.400> is<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.750> take<00:00:34.780> it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
much exactly what you do is you take it

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
much exactly what you do is you take it
on<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.530> long<00:00:35.710> side<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:36.670> fold<00:00:36.880> it<00:00:37.060> in<00:00:37.270> half

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
on the long side and you fold it in half

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.660 
on the long side and you fold it in half
so<00:00:42.300> okay<00:00:43.300> now<00:00:44.370> from<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:47.260> sides<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.640> are

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
so okay now from these sides that are

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.290 
so okay now from these sides that are
clappy<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:54.790> fold<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.180> up<00:00:56.280> into

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
clappy take that and you fold it up into

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.469 
clappy take that and you fold it up into
like<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.360> triangle<00:00:58.630> shape<00:00:59.130> yeah<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:04.269> take

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
like a triangle shape yeah then you take

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:13.260 
like a triangle shape yeah then you take
this<00:01:06.060> fold<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.360> way<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.170> like<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
this fold this way so it's like this and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.990 
this fold this way so it's like this and
you<00:01:14.170> hold<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.530> back<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.830> you<00:01:18.520> open<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.850> all

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
you hold the back then you open it all

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.520 
you hold the back then you open it all
up

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.730 

I<00:01:24.590> got<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:28.090> bring<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:32.290> crease<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.320> this

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
I got then bring this crease to this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.969 
I got then bring this crease to this
crease<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:37.280> has<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.700> go<00:01:38.390> back<00:01:38.540> still

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
crease so and this has to go back still

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:47.260 
crease so and this has to go back still
so<00:01:39.979> it's<00:01:40.159> kind<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.550> like<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:46.759> they<00:01:47.060> have

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
so it's kind of like this and they have

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.080 
so it's kind of like this and they have
it<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.680> what<00:01:48.680> should<00:01:49.009> happen<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.820> this

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
it and what should happen is that this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.219 
it and what should happen is that this
sticks<00:01:50.420> out<00:01:50.600> from<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.990> middle<00:01:52.030> then<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.450> take

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
sticks out from the middle then you take

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.669 
sticks out from the middle then you take
the<00:01:54.290> square<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.860> fold<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.220> up<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.679> you

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the square and you fold it up and you

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:05.770 
the square and you fold it up and you
take<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:59.860> triangle<00:02:00.860> piece<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:05.509> put<00:02:05.690> it

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
take this triangle piece and you put it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:24.940 
take this triangle piece and you put it
in<00:02:06.640> here<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:24.560> should<00:02:24.800> look

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
in here and this is what should look

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.789 
in here and this is what should look
like<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:27.290> there<00:02:27.790> take<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:30.590> fold

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
like from there take this and you fold

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.850 
like from there take this and you fold
it<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:33.100> after<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.519> fold<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.820> back

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
it like that after that you fold it back

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.140 
it like that after that you fold it back
and<00:02:36.860> if<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.220> do<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.690> open<00:02:38.930> up<00:02:39.019> kinda

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and if you do that you open up kinda

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.580 
and if you do that you open up kinda
that's<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:42.700> triangles<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:44.590> it's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that's like this triangles like it's

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.810 
that's like this triangles like it's
like<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:46.239> prism<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> want<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.700> like

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
like a prism and going to want to like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.640 
like a prism and going to want to like
weight<00:02:53.630> down<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.390> after<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.650> take

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
weight down like that after that take

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.420 
weight down like that after that take
this<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.709> fold<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.130> up<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:04.370> like

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
this and you fold it up see it's like

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.509 
this and you fold it up see it's like
half<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.030> length<00:03:05.180> or<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.650> do<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:06.890> again<00:03:08.140> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
half the length or you do it again and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:18.260 
half the length or you do it again and
you<00:03:10.519> do<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:12.880> again<00:03:14.470> and

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.940 

this<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.600> where<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.960> gets<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> really

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
this is where it gets to the really

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.570 
this is where it gets to the really
tricky<00:03:20.130> part<00:03:21.110> what<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.200> do<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:23.630> it's<00:03:24.630> like

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
tricky part what you do is it's like

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.790 
tricky part what you do is it's like
should<00:03:26.580> be<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:27.080> two<00:03:28.080> roles<00:03:28.350> now<00:03:28.590> kind<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.780> and

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
should be like two roles now kind of and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.080 
should be like two roles now kind of and
I<00:03:32.150> guess<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.360> kind<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:35.930> sa<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:38.130> hold<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.970> in

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
I guess you kind of a sa like hold it in

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.230 
I guess you kind of a sa like hold it in
the<00:03:39.120> middle<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.820> take<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:42.060> side<00:03:43.520> I'll<00:03:44.520> do<00:03:45.180> it

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
the middle and take this side I'll do it

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.110 
the middle and take this side I'll do it
to<00:03:45.330> both<00:03:45.450> sides<00:03:45.680> take<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.860> side<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to both sides take the side and like to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.050 
to both sides take the side and like to
fold<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.140> up<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.220> guess<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.660> way<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:52.280> got<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.970> you

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
fold it up I guess in a way I got so you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
fold it up I guess in a way I got so you
get<00:03:54.270> this<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:54.750> flat<00:03:55.140> piece<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.160> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
get this like flat piece do it to the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.380 
get this like flat piece do it to the
other<00:03:56.310> side<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:02.610> time<00:04:02.820> actually<00:04:03.060> wasn't

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
other side and that time actually wasn't

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.690 
other side and that time actually wasn't
that<00:04:03.540> bad<00:04:04.190> normally<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.310> hard<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:07.700> there's

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
that bad normally it's hard and there's

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.150 
that bad normally it's hard and there's
your<00:04:08.790> ipod<00:04:09.710> stand<00:04:12.020> these<00:04:13.020> ipod<00:04:13.470> stands<00:04:13.800> work

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
your ipod stand these ipod stands work
