 I searched for several videos of this TV in the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.130

 who are in doubt about buying the TV or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 One touch is to start the tour by running

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.830

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.910
 down here too, but it does not stop 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:25.690
 to be the daughter of the one who's back on tv 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.690
 that place 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.040
 They do not like the finish 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:48.280
 Ok I was angry because I did not 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.280
 I wanted this plastic that nobody yet 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:56.060
 here below we have the buttons 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.700

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.760
 channels is not out of me in downloading the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.300
 channel comment - volume we have 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.300
 menu button 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:15.320
 here we have the remote control functions 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:18.380
 basic digital TV shows she has to 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.590
 edit ok I can change the aspect 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.590
 will leave in four by 3 x 1 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.680
 ok I eat the edges here next to the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.310
 house but we were shocked when the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.110
 recordings were made in the old standard 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:44.060
 16 for new leaving normal 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.970
 the zoom and goes from the next image 12 to 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.010
 operation but still obviously scanning is 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:55.460
 that the use that it takes advantage of 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:58.810
 image is not missing anything in the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.979
 control has other menu options 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.870
 I have control of image control 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.930
 of sound 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.700
 of course I can not change the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.440
 watch it this is automatic with 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.960
 internet how I'm using the internet 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.360
 so the store is wrong 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:26.590
 here we have a region is a day laborer 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.590
 This is for video production. 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.750
 We have the right people is not connected. 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.600
 Logical mode I do not have the ability to 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.520
 entered the house and has an opinion 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.210
 then play the files via hd 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.210
 external or pendrive 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.790
 I 'm turning on my computer 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.140
 the entrance is free someone will increase one 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:00.830
 the volume of the sound system to 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:02.890
 idea of the quality of the salt is love is 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.890
 like this 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.600
 i 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.930
 how i was talking 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.140
 we also have a feature on this TV. 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.870
 system ginga the system ginga nothing more 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.690
 is a system where you connect the 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.000
 tv on the internet and they will tell you 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.750
 watching the globe program more 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.030
 you 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.590
 when you activate the ginga system will 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.450
 information about the program 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.000
 in a nice and cool way 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:42.200
 but only if you are 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.150
 watching and digital terrestrial tv like 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.970
 a new block from where I live, we do not have 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.770
 digital terrestrial tv 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.980
 If you want digital tv you have to buy one 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.450
 receiver and using satellite dishes is 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:58.760
 It has always been like this and for example tv 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.680
 store here we only have one channel or 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.750
 so we are always obliged to 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.510
 special receivers to watch and 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.690
 Here, then, you're going to give me 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.160
 there is this tv she can appeal 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.340
 you are seeing this 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.120
 reflected there but it is greatly reduced if 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.250
 was yesterday to see if this feature were 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.180
 much more expensive reflex would interfere 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:26.120
 much watching the video is who it is and 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.600
 so I guess you do not have any more 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.540
 Watch then I'm staying for 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.570
 here some question you can ask us 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.130
 comments only I have answered if 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:42.250
 subscribe to the channel but liked the video gives 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.250
 a young man there until the next time he spoke
