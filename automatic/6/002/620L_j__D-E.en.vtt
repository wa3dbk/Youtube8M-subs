00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.510 

today<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:01.890> gonna<00:00:01.979> really<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
today we're gonna really the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.519 
today we're gonna really the
distributive<00:00:03.090> property<00:00:03.140> but<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> little

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
distributive property but a little

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.079 
distributive property but a little
trickier<00:00:04.980> version<00:00:05.490> because<00:00:05.819> we're<00:00:06.000> gonna

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
trickier version because we're gonna

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.210 
trickier version because we're gonna
throw<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.540> some<00:00:06.569> negatives<00:00:07.109> let's<00:00:08.010> just

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
throw in some negatives let's just

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.509 
throw in some negatives let's just
quickly<00:00:08.429> review<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.090> distributive<00:00:09.630> property

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
quickly review the distributive property

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.259 
quickly review the distributive property
if<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.790> was<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.269> 4<00:00:12.570> times<00:00:13.110> 6<00:00:13.500> plus<00:00:13.769> 5

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
if I was going to do 4 times 6 plus 5

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.160 
if I was going to do 4 times 6 plus 5
obviously<00:00:15.269> before<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.809> learned<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
obviously before we learned the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.570 
obviously before we learned the
distributive<00:00:16.710> property<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.250> used<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> do

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
distributive property we used to do

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.390 
distributive property we used to do
order<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> operations<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.779> would<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.050> 4<00:00:19.400> times

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
order of operations we would do 4 times

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580 
order of operations we would do 4 times
11<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.720> 44

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
11 to get 44

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.590 
11 to get 44
however<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.760> recently<00:00:24.000> learned<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
however we recently learned the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.330 
however we recently learned the
distributive<00:00:25.170> property<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.650> help<00:00:25.890> us<00:00:26.130> later

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
distributive property to help us later

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
distributive property to help us later
in<00:00:26.550> algebra<00:00:26.970> when<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.359> variables<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
in algebra when there's variables in

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
in algebra when there's variables in
there<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.220> 4<00:00:29.460> times<00:00:29.760> 6<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.449> 24<00:00:31.399> whatever

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
there we did 4 times 6 is 24 whatever

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
there we did 4 times 6 is 24 whatever
you<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.759> number<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you do to one number you got to do to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.670 
you do to one number you got to do to
the<00:00:34.170> other

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the other

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
the other
so<00:00:35.280> we're<00:00:35.399> gonna<00:00:35.520> keep<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> addition<00:00:36.270> sign

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so we're gonna keep the addition sign

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.440 
so we're gonna keep the addition sign
and<00:00:36.870> 4<00:00:37.140> times<00:00:37.440> 5<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.680> 20<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:39.300> them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and 4 times 5 is 20 when you add them

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.770 
and 4 times 5 is 20 when you add them
notice<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.410> 44<00:00:41.149> if<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> do

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
notice you also get 44 if I was to do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
notice you also get 44 if I was to do
the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.219> problem<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.000> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the same thing to this problem down here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.170 
the same thing to this problem down here
with<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> variable<00:00:45.860> 5<00:00:46.860> times<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.760> written

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with a variable 5 times them is written

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.490 
with a variable 5 times them is written
as<00:00:48.300> 5m<00:00:49.070> keep<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.250> subtraction<00:00:50.879> sign<00:00:51.149> 5<00:00:52.050> times

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
as 5m keep your subtraction sign 5 times

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.930 
as 5m keep your subtraction sign 5 times
2<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:54.239> 10<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.410> 5<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> minus<00:00:56.489> 10<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
2 is just 10 so 5 and minus 10 is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
2 is just 10 so 5 and minus 10 is
simplified<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.739> M

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
simplified because we do not know what M

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.389 
simplified because we do not know what M
equals<00:00:59.600> now<00:01:00.600> let's<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> again<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.739> harder

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
equals now let's do it again but harder

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.840 
equals now let's do it again but harder
using<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.449> negatives<00:01:04.580> notice<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> have

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
using some negatives notice I have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.950 
using some negatives notice I have
negative<00:01:06.299> 7<00:01:06.510> times<00:01:07.470> 5<00:01:08.340> minus<00:01:08.850> 3<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
negative 7 times 5 minus 3 the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.969 
negative 7 times 5 minus 3 the
old-fashioned<00:01:10.560> way

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
old-fashioned way

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.630 
old-fashioned way
5<00:01:11.520> minus<00:01:11.970> 3<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.240> 2<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> technically<00:01:14.220> I'm<00:01:14.430> doing

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
5 minus 3 is 2 so technically I'm doing

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.620 
5 minus 3 is 2 so technically I'm doing
negative<00:01:14.850> 7<00:01:15.509> times<00:01:16.320> 2<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.070> negative<00:01:17.909> times<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
negative 7 times 2 a negative times a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.910 
negative 7 times 2 a negative times a
positive<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:19.140> gonna<00:01:19.380> give<00:01:19.560> me<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> negative

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
positive is gonna give me a negative

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.660 
positive is gonna give me a negative
answer<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> should<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.479> negative<00:01:21.720> 14<00:01:22.670> now

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
answer so I should get negative 14 now

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.660 
answer so I should get negative 14 now
let's<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.299> distributive<00:01:24.659> property

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
let's use the distributive property

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
let's use the distributive property
first<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.229> actually

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
first thing I want to do is I'm actually

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.370 
first thing I want to do is I'm actually
gonna<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.070> rid<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> subtraction<00:01:29.970> sign

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
gonna get rid of the subtraction sign

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
gonna get rid of the subtraction sign
because<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.100> complicated

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because that can be a little complicated

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.600 
because that can be a little complicated
when<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.299> multiplying<00:01:33.570> by<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> negative<00:01:34.610> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
when we're multiplying by a negative so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.300 
when we're multiplying by a negative so
I'm<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> keep<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.390> 5<00:01:36.680> I'm<00:01:37.680> gonna<00:01:37.890> change

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I'm going to keep the 5 I'm gonna change

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060 
I'm going to keep the 5 I'm gonna change
it<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> addition<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.990> gonna<00:01:40.140> flip<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> 3

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it to addition and I'm gonna flip the 3

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.929 
it to addition and I'm gonna flip the 3
to<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> negative<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.360> keep<00:01:42.780> change<00:01:43.320> flip

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
to a negative I just keep change flip

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.160 
to a negative I just keep change flip
now<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.780> distributive

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now I'm gonna do the distributive

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
now I'm gonna do the distributive
property<00:01:47.420> negative<00:01:48.420> 7<00:01:48.840> times<00:01:49.409> 5<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.280> negative

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
property negative 7 times 5 is negative

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
property negative 7 times 5 is negative
35<00:01:51.409> because<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> each<00:01:53.810> I'm

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
35 because you have one of each I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.920 
35 because you have one of each I'm
gonna<00:01:55.110> keep<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.560> plus<00:01:55.799> sign<00:01:56.570> now<00:01:57.570> I've<00:01:57.719> got

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gonna keep the plus sign now I've got

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
gonna keep the plus sign now I've got
negative<00:01:58.200> 7<00:01:59.270> times<00:02:00.270> negative<00:02:00.860> 3<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.640> negative

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
negative 7 times negative 3 and negative

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.219 
negative 7 times negative 3 and negative
times<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.420> negative<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.869> positive<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.890> 21

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
times a negative is positive so I get 21

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.369 
times a negative is positive so I get 21
notice<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.500> negative<00:02:07.740> 35<00:02:08.489> plus<00:02:09.000> 21<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
notice I get negative 35 plus 21 that is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.640 
notice I get negative 35 plus 21 that is
negative<00:02:10.890> 14<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> same<00:02:12.690> answer

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
negative 14 I get the same answer

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.660

sign and that good of 8 times 3 I've got

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.690 
sign and that good of 8 times 3 I've got
one<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.319> each<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.190> gonna<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.489> negative

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
one of each so it's gonna be a negative

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.920 
one of each so it's gonna be a negative
answer<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.930> gonna<00:02:37.140> get<00:02:37.319> negative<00:02:37.560> 24

let's<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.060> distributive<00:03:03.659> property

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
let's do the distributive property

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.599 
let's do the distributive property
negative<00:03:05.549> 7<00:03:06.000> times<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.810> negative<00:03:07.260> 5<00:03:07.500> I've<00:03:08.129> got

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
negative 7 times a negative 5 I've got

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.280 
negative 7 times a negative 5 I've got
two<00:03:08.879> negatives<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:09.930> gonna<00:03:10.049> get<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
two negatives so I'm gonna get a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.180 
two negatives so I'm gonna get a
positive<00:03:10.859> 35<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:12.870> gonna<00:03:13.200> keep<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.620> plus<00:03:13.890> sign

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
positive 35 I'm gonna keep the plus sign

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.289 
positive 35 I'm gonna keep the plus sign
and<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:15.870> I've<00:03:16.019> got<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> negative<00:03:16.829> 7<00:03:17.310> times<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
and now I've got a negative 7 times a

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.050 
and now I've got a negative 7 times a
negative<00:03:18.870> B<00:03:19.250> two<00:03:20.250> negatives<00:03:20.730> think<00:03:20.940> we're

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
negative B two negatives think we're

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.720 
negative B two negatives think we're
positive<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.590> 7<00:03:23.010> times<00:03:23.220> B<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.030> 7<00:03:24.510> B<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:26.190> 35

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
positive so 7 times B is just 7 B so 35

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.199 
positive so 7 times B is just 7 B so 35
plus<00:03:27.180> 7<00:03:27.569> B<00:03:27.720> would<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.230> answer<00:03:29.000> notice<00:03:30.000> it's

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
plus 7 B would be my answer notice it's

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.690 
plus 7 B would be my answer notice it's
very<00:03:30.389> similar<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.530> how<00:03:31.829> we<00:03:31.889> learned<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> before

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
very similar to how we learned it before

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.900 
very similar to how we learned it before
just<00:03:33.019> it's<00:03:34.019> usually<00:03:34.500> helpful<00:03:35.069> if<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.609> keep

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
just it's usually helpful if you keep

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.690 
just it's usually helpful if you keep
change<00:03:36.299> flip<00:03:36.419> or<00:03:36.930> add<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.379> opposite<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.519> we

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
change flip or add the opposite so we

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.909 
change flip or add the opposite so we
get<00:03:38.879> rid<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> subtraction<00:03:39.660> sign<00:03:40.019> if<00:03:40.620> we're

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
get rid of the subtraction sign if we're

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.619 
get rid of the subtraction sign if we're
multiplying<00:03:41.040> by<00:03:41.519> some<00:03:41.849> negative<00:03:42.269> numbers

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
multiplying by some negative numbers

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.020 
multiplying by some negative numbers
that's<00:03:43.470> how<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.799> work<00:03:44.129> on<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> distributive

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that's how you work on the distributive

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.540 
that's how you work on the distributive
property
