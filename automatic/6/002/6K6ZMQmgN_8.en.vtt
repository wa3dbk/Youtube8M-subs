00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you can see that at impact the right I'm

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
you can see that at impact the right I'm
still<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.549> bent<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.869> created<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> position

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
still very bent this created a position

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.700 
still very bent this created a position
where<00:01:46.950> she<00:01:47.659> couldn't<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:48.780> pressurize<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
where she couldn't really pressurize to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
put any pressure on the ball that's why

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
put any pressure on the ball that's why
she<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> weak<00:01:52.829> ball<00:01:53.100> flight<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.759> also<00:01:54.299> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
she got a weak ball flight and also just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.230 
she got a weak ball flight and also just
the<00:01:54.750> elbow<00:01:55.200> being<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.520> angle<00:01:57.060> will

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the elbow being on this angle will

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
the elbow being on this angle will
always<00:01:57.540> result<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> club<00:01:58.409> cutting<00:01:58.860> across

always result in the club cutting across

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
always result in the club cutting across
the<00:01:59.310> ball<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> I'd<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.420> path<00:02:00.719> treating<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380

the ball and I'd in path treating that
cut<00:02:01.680> shot<00:02:02.060> too

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
cut shot too

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.250 
cut shot too
two<00:02:05.310> reasons<00:02:05.790> why<00:02:06.000> should<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.930> losing

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
two reasons why should we be losing

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.699 
two reasons why should we be losing
distance<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.920> accuracy<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:12.500> problem<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.620> I

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
distance and accuracy so problem as I

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.620 
distance and accuracy so problem as I
said<00:02:13.920> -<00:02:14.040> actually<00:02:14.400> quite<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> complicated

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
said - actually quite a complicated

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.290 
said - actually quite a complicated
movement<00:02:16.260> she<00:02:16.680> had<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.130> her<00:02:17.250> right<00:02:17.459> arm<00:02:17.640> I'll

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
movement she had with her right arm I'll

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.330 
movement she had with her right arm I'll
be<00:02:18.450> quite<00:02:18.630> difficult<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.140> explain<00:02:19.340> but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
be quite difficult to explain but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640 
be quite difficult to explain but
basically<00:02:20.819> she<00:02:20.970> wasn't<00:02:21.569> putting<00:02:22.410> any

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
basically she wasn't putting any

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
basically she wasn't putting any
pressure<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.400> her<00:02:23.520> right<00:02:23.730> arm<00:02:23.760> during<00:02:24.360> the

pressure in her right arm during the

she<00:03:49.260> did<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:49.650> well<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.220> lesson<00:03:50.459> was<00:03:50.790> she

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
she did so well in this lesson was she

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420 
she did so well in this lesson was she
understood<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.600> movement<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.320> she<00:03:53.190> learned

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
understood the movement and she learned

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.640 
understood the movement and she learned
to<00:03:53.549> feel<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.180> movement<00:03:54.329> before<00:03:54.780> she<00:03:55.380> tried

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
to feel the movement before she tried

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.300 
to feel the movement before she tried
hitting<00:03:55.920> longer<00:03:56.430> shots<00:03:57.500> within<00:03:58.500> I'll<00:03:59.100> come

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
hitting longer shots within I'll come

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.310 
hitting longer shots within I'll come
back<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.640> you<00:04:00.239> can<00:04:00.390> see<00:04:00.570> when<00:04:00.930> she<00:04:00.959> does

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
back to that you can see when she does

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.009 
back to that you can see when she does
right<00:04:01.560> arm<00:04:01.739> only<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.700> arm<00:04:02.970> leads<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.780> club

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
right arm only the arm leads the club

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.870 
right arm only the arm leads the club
pet<00:04:04.290> rather<00:04:04.739> than<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.010> club<00:04:05.250> head<00:04:05.430> leading

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
pet rather than the club head leading

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.340 
pet rather than the club head leading
the<00:04:06.000> elbow<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.359> that's<00:04:06.510> why<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.810> arm<00:04:07.079> always

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
the elbow and that's why the arm always

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.319 
the elbow and that's why the arm always
stayed<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:07.799> front<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.310> her<00:04:08.430> body<00:04:08.640> keeping<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
stayed in front of her body keeping the

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.570 
stayed in front of her body keeping the
club<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:09.720> plan

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
club on plan

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.949 
club on plan
so<00:04:12.580> then<00:04:12.730> we<00:04:12.879> started<00:04:13.270> right<00:04:13.540> arm<00:04:13.690> only

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
so then we started right arm only

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.930 
so then we started right arm only
hitting<00:04:14.200> hitting<00:04:14.709> balls<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.250> told<00:04:15.670> her<00:04:15.819> this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
hitting hitting balls I told her this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.060 
hitting hitting balls I told her this
could<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.239> 70%<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:17.019> her<00:04:17.079> practice<00:04:17.260> at<00:04:17.919> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
could be 70% of her practice at the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.090 
could be 70% of her practice at the
beginning<00:04:18.430> again<00:04:19.410> loading<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> arm<00:04:20.680> loading

one-hour lesson see a lot more load of
the<00:05:22.479> right<00:05:22.660> wrist<00:05:22.840> in<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.110> backswing<00:05:23.940> more

pressure in the arm helps create that

pressure in the arm helps create that
then<00:05:28.720> this<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.080> key<00:05:29.260> same<00:05:29.830> feeling<00:05:30.250> coming
