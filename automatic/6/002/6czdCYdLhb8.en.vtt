a brand new GoPro why don't you have an

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
a brand new GoPro why don't you have an
equal<00:00:41.820> hubs<00:00:41.969> man<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.350> definitely<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
equal hubs man and that definitely is a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.560 
equal hubs man and that definitely is a
great<00:00:44.579> point<00:00:44.989> I<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.700> think

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
great point I actually was using I think

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
great point I actually was using I think
it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.079> pair<00:00:49.379> before<00:00:49.559> too<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it was this pair before too when I was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.299 
it was this pair before too when I was
riding<00:00:50.760> back<00:00:51.379> from<00:00:52.379> picking<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> bike<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
riding back from picking up the bike and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.650 
riding back from picking up the bike and
then<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.670> didn't<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> wear<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> man<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
then I just didn't want to wear a man in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
then I just didn't want to wear a man in
the<00:00:54.750> video<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.289> they're<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.590> kind<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> not

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the video because they're so kind of not

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
the video because they're so kind of not
the<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:57.030> ones<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.899> but

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the right ones they don't look good but

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
the right ones they don't look good but
I<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.399> definitely<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.820> safety<00:01:00.180> concern

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I think it's definitely a safety concern

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
I think it's definitely a safety concern
and<00:01:00.809> somebody<00:01:01.140> mentioned<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:01.980> the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
just getting bored with the bike that's

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.920 
just getting bored with the bike that's
another<00:05:52.490> reason<00:05:52.670> why<00:05:52.850> I<00:05:52.940> think<00:05:53.270> this<00:05:53.630> bike<00:05:53.900> is

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
another reason why I think this bike is

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.050 
another reason why I think this bike is
a<00:05:54.080> great<00:05:54.320> starter<00:05:54.740> bike<00:05:54.770> because<00:05:55.700> it's<00:05:55.940> not

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
a great starter bike because it's not

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.280 
a great starter bike because it's not
like<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.480> have<00:05:56.630> something<00:05:56.810> that's<00:05:56.900> really

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
like you have something that's really

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.230 
like you have something that's really
really<00:05:57.530> weak<00:05:57.770> barely<00:05:58.370> any<00:05:58.670> power<00:05:58.850> so<00:05:59.210> you

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
really weak barely any power so you

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.390 
really weak barely any power so you
don't<00:05:59.420> kill<00:05:59.600> yourself<00:05:59.750> and<00:06:00.260> then<00:06:00.980> you<00:06:01.010> know

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
don't kill yourself and then you know

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.550 
don't kill yourself and then you know
three<00:06:01.700> months<00:06:01.850> later<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.870> have<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.050> sell<00:06:03.350> it

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
three months later you have to sell it

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.140 
three months later you have to sell it
and<00:06:04.010> waste<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.430> bunch<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:04.700> money<00:06:04.850> to<00:06:05.030> get

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
and waste a bunch of money to get
