00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.220
 following our telephone conversation 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.709
 we allow ourselves to make you 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.780

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 and medium surface 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 for ten years we have noticed that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.860
 French offer chocolate bunnies 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.360
 like the bells and chickens that 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 are less and less to buy 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.519
 only ten years ago in France 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.140
 the gold rabbit has established itself as a 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.690
 inescapable pope 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.630

 I just wanted to share with you 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.110
 this new deal that besides 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.760
 attests to the approximation 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.550
 taste between Germany and France 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.190
 the rapprochement in terms of taste 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.130
 between germany and france 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.590
 farewell hens frying bells as well so 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.690
 you my compatriots you let yourself 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.150
 guide in your choices by the force of 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.489
 striking of an international group yes 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.290

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.790
 no to pileup 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.350
 we could not let pass 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.600
 like this under our eyes 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.459
 this example of brutal globalization 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.459
 which is proud of 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.650
 industrial an otherwise industrial 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.480
 very kind who showed himself strong 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.820
 generous with us but who did 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.640
 maybe not grabbed that he's trying 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.269
 to completely undermine the very foundations of 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.269
 our show
