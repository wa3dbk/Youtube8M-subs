00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello today words of sl 5 the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.720
 little combo that slash now uses 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.180
 when he repeats in the boxes then 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.349
 it's a small 5 watts entirely to 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.439
 the amp closed behind to have a little 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.740
 more basic two channels incline one 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.250
 will listen right away and a channel 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 distortion so we start with the channel 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 clear 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.489
 m 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 we 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.720
 the amp incorporates a digital reverb 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.720
 we will listen right now 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.539
 a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.170
 and we go now to the saturated channel 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.550
 marc huh 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.550
 we 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.930
 Oh 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
 Oh 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.370
 but 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.370
 moment 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.990
 and last little tip for those who 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.900
 want to use the sl 5 at home on 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.360
 can the switch is 5 watts in watts 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.820
 so here I will play first in 5 watts 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.130
 then I put it in stand by I 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.220
 will go into watts and we'll see the 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.220
 difference 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.190
 m 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.940
 stand by I pass in 1 watt 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.310
 Oh 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.790
 here we have seen the domestic needs 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.250
 stars sometimes have good for us 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.060
 here is a little amp that is really 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.169
 very pleasant to use 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.550
 especially a watt from elsewhere 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.699
 when at home 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.760
 and then we can even use in 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:43.310
 small places in 5 watts without any 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.310
 problem and on that I greet you well
