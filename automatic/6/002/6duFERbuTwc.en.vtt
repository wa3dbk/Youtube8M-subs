it does leave in some of the minerals

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
it does leave in some of the minerals
because<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> minerals<00:01:03.449> in

all out once the water is purified
through<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> filtration<00:01:09.030> process<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.260> next

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
through that filtration process the next

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
through that filtration process the next
step<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> water<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:11.970> into

step then is for the water to go into

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990 
step then is for the water to go into
