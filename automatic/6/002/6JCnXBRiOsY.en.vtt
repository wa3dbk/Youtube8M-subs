00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.750
 Today we have a holiday today on our 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 with you the channel has accumulated 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 1000 subscribers now even a little 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.210
 more but it doesnâ€™t matter what 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 it is today 1000 subscribers it 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.080
 let's say this is such a sign number 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 because it is a certain milestone and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 let's talk a little about how 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.740
 it all started 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.779
 here is November 7, 2012 that is only two 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
 month with a little I laid out the first 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 the very first movie on his channel that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.010
 I really wanted a moment so that I 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 I was doing someone interesting but then I 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.530
 I did not expect that in just two seconds 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.960
 in a small month there will be a whole thousand 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 friends on my yutube and they will all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.550
 participate life channel leave 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.300
 comments your opinions speak out 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 advise something to offer in general 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 my friends you and so you know all this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.680
 every day see it here we are already 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.260
 A lot of us are already very many 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.019
 could hope that in two months of us 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.840
 there will be 1000 people, but from that to me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.270
 only more pleasant hope that we say 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.979
 so you no less fun than all here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 these guys who are now on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.350
 screen dance and make fun and even zombies 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 who can't raise their hands 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.970
 skill trying to dance 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.009
 amine so he just know just a soul 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 puts his dance bounces and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.850
 almost doing a somersault in the air and for the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.579
 back max and agility on the little bear 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.560
 such a little shake that I decided 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.030
 give him a prize for a thousand 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.869
 subscribers because I think that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.579
 the merit of maxilla is great enough 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 I think that most of my subscribers 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.049
 channel know 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.759
 the game scribble over so not only 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 so we are because here it allows 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.229
 do such things funny here haste 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.970
 made this scene and decided in this way 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.540
 how to do something like that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 I give the picture to my picture 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.189
 a small monologue in which I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.909

 be of course not a big holiday 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.640
 1000 subscribers is still not 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.739
 any kind of huge hundred but for 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.260
 important that you are interested understand here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 this is the most important thing that you do 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 it was necessary for somebody 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.430

 develop hope will develop in 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.459
 right direction I'm as always 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.510
 I listen to you and try somehow 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.489
 to develop in the direction in which 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.830
 you need it but the essence of my 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.900
 channel it will remain the same that is 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.690
 my author's channel is primarily like me 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.760
 I already said somewhere I will help write what 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.580
 I want something and roll back because it's mine 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.410
 channel i mean just that i will 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 make videos only for those games 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.879
 which I find interesting only by 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.480
 those games about which I consider it necessary 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.150
 tell you and hopefully at least 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.450
 some of them will seem to you too 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.860
 the goal is our task well friends we 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.629

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.100
