00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.920
 statistics says that approximately 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.299
 5 years of our life we â€‹â€‹spend exactly 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.820
 here in the bathroom 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.440
 Therefore, designers devote particular 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.080
 attention when designing 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 this room today is our topic is mine 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.900
 small bathroom and what am I with 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020
 do this 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.970
 turn to the experts tonelli im 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 interior designer with 10 river doses 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 kind of author boon from us at the facility in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.699
 Ukraine and Europe 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 the first rule for any bathroom 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.470
 is it saving space if you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 put the shower stall she should go out 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 with clear glass or if there is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.100
 opportunity not to do the shower 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.379
 a cabin like for example in our case 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 way we do not collect the volume of the room 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.010
 the second rule is the lighting sensation 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
 very important moment in any room 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.200
 especially in the bathroom if she 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.559
 little 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 in this example we see a wonderful 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 light wall support which 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 expands the visual space and gives 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 extra bathroom lighting 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.170
 must be at least three sources 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.299
 light warm light can be cold 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 light and must be bright 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.159
 the room especially if the bathroom 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 no bathroom mirrors should not 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.390
 show what you are doing to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.750
 shelves they should preferably 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.280
 display or light wall or if u 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 do you have any image with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.409
 the prospect will also be paying as we 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.539
 should talk about the tiles in the bathroom 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.819
 without her bathroom, we also do not imagine 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.979
 represent and tile can be like 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.719
 still a small cell can be 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 dark and light main to do 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.069
 the correct layout of the tiles and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.929
 may be horizontal division may 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.709
 be vertical sometimes you can 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.829
 emphasize 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.719
 sometimes it's just walls made in 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.979
 different tiles and not necessarily to 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.250
 it was one collection 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.200
 you can take and you can create different 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.179
 its even a small bathroom 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.780
 imitation such as roman terms 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.369
 putting a little mosaic on the ceiling and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.649
 thus decorate even the ceilings 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.629
 but completely dark bathroom 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.729
 probably not worth doing if she 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:07.229
 small is better to combine 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.319
 dark with light if you really really want 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:16.799
 dark light room they always 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:19.049
 visually look bigger and the most 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.870
 important in any bathroom 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.489
 this is the aura that you create as 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.410
 shows design practice 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.870
 small bathroom is no reason 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.200
 for concern, but only a reason to show 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.200
 ingenuity
