carpet<00:00:08.940> by<00:00:09.240> any<00:00:09.450> means<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.559> place

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
carpet by any means this was the place

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.070 
carpet by any means this was the place
where<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> Asus<00:00:12.980> a7m<00:00:14.150> 266<00:00:15.150> motherboard<00:00:15.780> obly

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
area where this desktop is my

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.439 
area where this desktop is my
grandparents<00:00:20.910> house<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.119> picked<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.269> up

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
grandparents house so I picked this up

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
grandparents house so I picked this up
at<00:00:24.570> Goodwill<00:00:25.019> they're<00:00:25.320> asking<00:00:25.470> $10<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
at Goodwill they're asking $10 and of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.689 
at Goodwill they're asking $10 and of
course<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> dusty<00:00:28.189> 80%<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> computers

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
course is dusty 80% of the computers

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
course is dusty 80% of the computers
that<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.939> through<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that go through there have all the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.709 
that go through there have all the
components<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.610> people<00:00:33.480> leave<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
components in there so people leave the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
components in there so people leave the
hard<00:00:33.899> drives<00:00:34.170> disk<00:00:34.559> drives<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.100> am<00:00:35.370> power

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
supply across this or all that good

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.080 
supply across this or all that good
stuff<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.190> surprise<00:00:41.370> this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
stuff in them but to my surprise this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.920 
stuff in them but to my surprise this
was<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> computers<00:00:43.340> little<00:00:44.930> little

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
was one of the computers little little

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
was one of the computers little little
bad<00:00:46.079> kids<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.890> steal<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> RAM<00:00:47.430> Aldi's<00:00:47.879> -

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
bad kids go and steal the RAM Aldi's -

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
bad kids go and steal the RAM Aldi's -
probably<00:00:48.719> black<00:00:49.500> market<00:00:50.010> them<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.430> something

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
probably black market them or something

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
probably black market them or something
and<00:00:52.129> if<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:54.030> came<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> computer

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and if they came into the computer

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
and if they came into the computer
without<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> camera<00:00:56.460> seeing<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.879> they'll

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
without the camera seeing them they'll

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.729 
without the camera seeing them they'll
get<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> RAM<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.020> I've<00:00:58.350> gotten<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.550> HP

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
get the RAM if I've gotten that HP

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.410 
get the RAM if I've gotten that HP
million<00:01:04.760> 6300<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.750> something<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.420> there's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
million 6300 or something and there's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.219 
million 6300 or something and there's
another<00:01:09.689> computer<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:11.400> spring<00:01:11.880> break

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
another computer I got like spring break

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
another computer I got like spring break
but<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.590> computer<00:01:14.490> add<00:01:14.640> screws<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> side

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
but that computer add screws on the side

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
but that computer add screws on the side
of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> case<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.409> no<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> RAM<00:01:17.490> out

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
of the case and no one got the RAM out

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.440 
of the case and no one got the RAM out
of<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.229> that's<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.220> happens<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> RAM

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
of it so that's what happens the RAM

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.710 
of it so that's what happens the RAM
actually<00:01:24.619> bought<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.009> Fry's<00:01:26.340> store<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
actually bought it from a Fry's store it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.179 
actually bought it from a Fry's store it

is Patriot memory one gig PC 3200 400
megahertz<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.390> computer<00:01:36.840> apparently

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
megahertz which is computer apparently

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.429 
megahertz which is computer apparently
reads<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:38.210> 333<00:01:39.210> megahertz<00:01:39.720> when<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.140> should<00:01:40.320> be

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
reads it 333 megahertz when it should be

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.789 
reads it 333 megahertz when it should be
ready<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> reading<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> 400<00:01:42.530> but<00:01:43.530> oh

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
ready and reading you that 400 but oh

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.230 
ready and reading you that 400 but oh
well<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.520> about<00:01:47.610> $30.00

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
well what it is so that was about $30.00

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.499 
well what it is so that was about $30.00
so<00:01:48.509> 40<00:01:49.049> dollars<00:01:49.320> invested<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> computer

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
so 40 dollars invested in this computer

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
so 40 dollars invested in this computer
maybe<00:01:51.509> I'll<00:01:51.720> sell<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> maybe<00:01:52.320> I'll<00:01:52.560> keep<00:01:52.829> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
maybe I'll sell it maybe I'll keep it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.990 
maybe I'll sell it maybe I'll keep it
who<00:01:53.579> knows<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> specs<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> are

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
who knows but the specs of it are

so heat makers right here but it is the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.300 
so heat makers right here but it is the
non<00:02:32.310> HD<00:02:32.580> model<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.630> 2<00:02:34.140> also<00:02:34.320> made<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> HT
