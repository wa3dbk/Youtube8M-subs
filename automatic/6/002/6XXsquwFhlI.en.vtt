00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
almost made my entire body combust into

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.179 
almost made my entire body combust into
a<00:01:06.930> ball<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.290> fire<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.100> have

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
a ball of fire and then that would have

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
a ball of fire and then that would have
been<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> been<00:01:08.880> great<00:01:09.150> right<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.750> yeah

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
been that have been great right so yeah

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.340 
been that have been great right so yeah
mr.<00:01:11.040> Luna<00:01:11.340> could<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.580> died<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.600> think

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
mr. Luna could have died so I think

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.359 
mr. Luna could have died so I think
that's<00:01:13.619> probably<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> craziest

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that's probably one of the craziest

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.469 
that's probably one of the craziest
things<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:14.909> ever<00:01:15.000> happened<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.390> me
