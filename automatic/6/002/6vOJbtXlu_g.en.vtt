the stretch x the name of the stretch x
is<00:00:21.789> basically<00:00:22.179> given<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.599> it<00:00:22.720> because<00:00:23.079> it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
is basically given to it because it

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
cube looks as though it is being

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.689 
cube looks as though it is being
stretched<00:00:33.700> out<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.890> puzzle<00:00:36.039> was<00:00:36.190> made<00:00:36.430> using

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
stretched out the puzzle was made using

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.799 
stretched out the puzzle was made using
a<00:00:37.030> type<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.480> DIY<00:00:38.050> 3<00:00:38.410> x<00:00:38.530> 3<00:00:38.559> x<00:00:38.739> 3<00:00:38.859> cube<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:40.179> puzzle

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
a type a DIY 3 x 3 x 3 cube the puzzle

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.990 
a type a DIY 3 x 3 x 3 cube the puzzle
the<00:00:41.320> original<00:00:41.620> q<00:00:41.829> was<00:00:41.980> basically<00:00:42.250> cut<00:00:42.489> down<00:00:42.730> to

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
the original q was basically cut down to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.869 
the original q was basically cut down to
a<00:00:43.030> full<00:00:43.719> half<00:00:44.050> truncated<00:00:44.649> cube<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.129> then<00:00:45.670> from

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
a full half truncated cube and then from

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.090 
a full half truncated cube and then from
that<00:00:45.910> point<00:00:46.059> after<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.929> four<00:00:47.199> sides<00:00:47.679> were<00:00:47.890> cut

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
that point after the four sides were cut

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.310 
that point after the four sides were cut
down<00:00:48.129> i<00:00:48.550> built<00:00:48.850> them<00:00:49.000> back<00:00:49.149> up<00:00:49.359> again<00:00:49.480> like<00:00:50.199> you

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
down i built them back up again like you

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.020 
down i built them back up again like you
would<00:00:50.469> on<00:00:50.500> an<00:00:50.739> axis<00:00:51.070> q<00:00:51.339> but<00:00:51.519> i<00:00:51.550> didn't<00:00:51.850> touch

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
would on an axis q but i didn't touch

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.729 
would on an axis q but i didn't touch
the<00:00:52.239> tops<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.750> bottoms<00:00:53.109> i<00:00:53.260> only<00:00:53.440> did<00:00:53.589> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
the tops of the bottoms i only did the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.439 
the tops of the bottoms i only did the
four<00:00:53.980> sides<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.789> then<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.059> gives<00:00:55.179> it<00:00:55.329> the

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
four sides so then it gives it the

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.549 
four sides so then it gives it the
illusion<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.960> stretching<00:00:56.559> out<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:58.300> colors<00:00:59.289> of

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
illusion of stretching out the colors of

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.200 
illusion of stretching out the colors of
the<00:00:59.649> puzzle<00:01:00.219> are<00:01:00.339> white<00:01:01.620> bright<00:01:02.620> orange

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the puzzle are white bright orange

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
the puzzle are white bright orange
yellow<00:01:04.210> red<00:01:05.790> blue<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.150> green<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.350> it's<00:01:08.710> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
yellow red blue and green and it's a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140 
yellow red blue and green and it's a
light<00:01:10.030> blue<00:01:10.270> as<00:01:10.480> well<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.700> rotation<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:13.120> the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
light blue as well the rotation of the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:41.220 
light blue as well the rotation of the
puzzle<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.510> excellent

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.010 

so<00:01:42.230> as<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.890> tell<00:01:43.480> that's<00:01:44.480> a<00:01:44.570> checkerboard

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
so as you can tell that's a checkerboard

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.080 
so as you can tell that's a checkerboard
pattern<00:01:45.290> here<00:01:45.470> for<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.830> when<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.700> deviate

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
pattern here for you when you deviate

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.760 
pattern here for you when you deviate
from<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.390> checkerboard<00:01:47.840> pattern<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.440> cube

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
from the checkerboard pattern the cube

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.880 
from the checkerboard pattern the cube
does<00:01:49.040> change<00:01:49.430> its<00:01:49.610> shape<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:51.500> know<00:01:51.590> i'll

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
does change its shape now you know i'll

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.719 
does change its shape now you know i'll
give<00:01:52.250> her<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.400> good<00:01:52.610> scramble<00:01:57.520> here<00:01:58.520> are<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> few

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
give her a good scramble here are a few

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.190 
give her a good scramble here are a few
