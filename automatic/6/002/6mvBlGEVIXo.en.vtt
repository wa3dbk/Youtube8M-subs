okay so now if we're going to set this
into<00:03:50.349> your<00:03:50.590> hair<00:03:50.890> for<00:03:51.220> about<00:03:51.370> uh<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:52.510> could

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
into your hair for about uh you could

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.750

I'm<00:03:54.879> gonna<00:03:54.970> do<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.239> for<00:03:55.360> an<00:03:55.450> hour<00:03:55.659> because<00:03:56.440> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
I'm gonna do it for an hour because I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.399 
I'm gonna do it for an hour because I
thicker<00:03:57.159> longer<00:03:57.489> hair<00:03:57.909> so<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.900> means<00:03:59.140> we

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
thicker longer hair so that means we

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.900 
thicker longer hair so that means we
have<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> insulate<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:00.400> heat<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.360> hair

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
have to insulate the heat and the hair

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:12.319 
have to insulate the heat and the hair
