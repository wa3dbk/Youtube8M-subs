our flight were 1219 miles to go if I go

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.250 
our flight were 1219 miles to go if I go
to<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> fixed<00:02:19.000> page<00:02:19.209> floor<00:02:19.540> where<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.900> put<00:02:20.170> in

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
to the fixed page floor where I put in

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.800 
to the fixed page floor where I put in
our<00:02:22.230> destination<00:02:23.230> we're<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:24.450> 977<00:02:25.450> miles

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
our destination we're actually 977 miles

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
our destination we're actually 977 miles
from<00:02:26.080> there<00:02:26.290> as<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> crow<00:02:26.709> flies<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.459> can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
from there as the crow flies so you can

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.729 
from there as the crow flies so you can
see<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.030> we're<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.989> fly<00:02:29.170> well<00:02:29.470> over

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
see that we're going to fly well over

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.699 
see that we're going to fly well over
200<00:02:30.220> miles<00:02:30.370> there's<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.880> 219<00:02:31.569> or<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.140> 16<00:02:32.560> as

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
200 miles there's the 219 or to 16 as

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
200 miles there's the 219 or to 16 as
the<00:02:32.830> crow<00:02:33.010> flies<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> mean<00:02:34.780> as<00:02:35.020> we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the crow flies and there I mean as we

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.550 
the crow flies and there I mean as we
fly<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.130> there's<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.090> 9<00:02:37.420> setting<00:02:38.200> season

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
fly and there's the 9 setting season

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.949 
fly and there's the 9 setting season
again<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.400> because<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.970> huge<00:02:40.330> turn<00:02:40.720> we

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
again this is because this huge turn we

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.860 
again this is because this huge turn we
have<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.260> take<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:42.760> Beijing<00:02:42.970> one<00:02:43.600> thing<00:02:43.780> is

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
have to take up in Beijing one thing is

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.180 
have to take up in Beijing one thing is
kind<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.140> interesting<00:02:44.319> I've<00:02:44.680> noticed<00:02:45.010> they<00:02:45.130> do

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
kind of interesting I've noticed they do

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.270 
kind of interesting I've noticed they do
if<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:46.300> go<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.480> our<00:02:46.569> round<00:02:46.959> page<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:48.250> can

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
if we go to our round page here you can

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.009 
if we go to our round page here you can
see<00:02:48.610> here<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.120> we<00:02:49.600> put<00:02:49.630> an<00:02:49.930> offset<00:02:50.500> right<00:02:50.920> one

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
see here that we put an offset right one

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.479 
see here that we put an offset right one
that's<00:02:53.019> our<00:02:53.319> one<00:02:53.709> now<00:02:54.010> I'm<00:02:54.100> going<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.310> change

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that's our one now I'm going to change

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.900 
that's our one now I'm going to change
the<00:02:54.880> scale<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.050> our<00:02:56.170> map<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.860> here<00:02:57.790> you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
the scale here on our map and here you

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640 
the scale here on our map and here you
can<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.480> we're<00:02:58.600> actually<00:02:58.750> flying<00:02:59.110> one

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
can see that we're actually flying one

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.820 
can see that we're actually flying one
mile<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.310> course<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.970> only<00:03:01.239> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
mile right of course this is only a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.620 
mile right of course this is only a
5-mile<00:03:02.830> scale<00:03:03.220> 10<00:03:03.519> miles<00:03:03.760> all<00:03:04.030> together<00:03:04.150> shown

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
5-mile scale 10 miles all together shown

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.900 
5-mile scale 10 miles all together shown
there<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.650> we're<00:03:05.799> flying<00:03:06.069> right<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.519> course

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
there and we're flying right of course

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.590 
there and we're flying right of course
and<00:03:08.069> we're<00:03:09.069> doing<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:09.430> at<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.819> request<00:03:10.420> of

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and we're doing this at the request of

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.990 
and we're doing this at the request of
ATC<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.319> didn't<00:03:11.530> request<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.640> I

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
ATC we didn't request to do this and I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.910 
ATC we didn't request to do this and I
actually<00:03:13.510> think<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.290> hell<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.799> good

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
actually think this is a hell of a good

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.330 
actually think this is a hell of a good
idea<00:03:15.100> because<00:03:16.650> even<00:03:17.650> these<00:03:17.799> older<00:03:18.160> aircraft

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
idea because even these older aircraft

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.390 
idea because even these older aircraft
that<00:03:18.730> we<00:03:18.850> fly<00:03:19.090> now<00:03:19.360> when<00:03:19.989> they<00:03:20.170> have<00:03:20.769> these<00:03:20.950> FM

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
that we fly now when they have these FM

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.870 
that we fly now when they have these FM
SS<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.000> they're<00:03:23.160> updated<00:03:24.160> well<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.700> this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
SS and they're updated well this this

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.819 
SS and they're updated well this this
one<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.120> actually<00:03:25.510> updated<00:03:25.660> by<00:03:26.019> radio<00:03:26.440> we<00:03:26.650> just

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
one is actually updated by radio we just

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.490 
one is actually updated by radio we just
have<00:03:26.950> radio<00:03:27.310> radio<00:03:27.670> update

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
have radio radio update

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.950 
have radio radio update
and<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.310> they're<00:03:30.460> upgraded<00:03:30.910> by<00:03:32.130> Jeep<00:03:33.130> GPS

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960
