00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it in and you just slide it in like that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.340 
it in and you just slide it in like that
alright<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.500> taller<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.520> minifigure

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350

alright it's taller than a minifigure
much<00:01:43.350> taller<00:01:43.799> than<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> minifigure<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
much taller than a minifigure so it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.870 
much taller than a minifigure so it
makes<00:01:44.939> makes<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.390> nice<00:01:45.540> big<00:01:45.810> fence<00:01:46.220> now<00:01:47.220> if
