pop clips that you pop out up top and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.570 
pop clips that you pop out up top and
I'll<00:02:23.230> point<00:02:23.500> those<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.920> underneath<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.980> what

I'll point those out underneath so what

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.089 
I'll point those out underneath so what
you're<00:02:27.730> going<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:27.879> do<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.800> where<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
you're going to do is this is where the

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.059 
you're going to do is this is where the
three<00:02:30.459> bolts<00:02:30.819> sit<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:32.050> front<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.680> then

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
three bolts sit up front and then

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.680 
three bolts sit up front and then
there's<00:02:33.190> these<00:02:33.340> two<00:02:33.400> side<00:02:33.880> hanger<00:02:34.300> pieces

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
there's these two side hanger pieces

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.270 
there's these two side hanger pieces
which<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.260> each<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> bolt<00:02:35.980> in<00:02:36.160> there

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
which will each have a bolt in there

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.360 
which will each have a bolt in there
sometimes<00:02:36.819> they<00:02:37.810> get<00:02:37.959> lost<00:02:38.170> over<00:02:38.530> time<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.130> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
sometimes they get lost over time so you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.640 
sometimes they get lost over time so you
might<00:02:40.120> only<00:02:40.299> have<00:02:40.510> one<00:02:40.810> or<00:02:40.989> two<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.290> there<00:02:41.470> and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
might only have one or two in there and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.100 
might only have one or two in there and
then<00:02:42.130> they<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.269> pop<00:02:43.540> clips<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.049> are

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
then they have to pop clips that are

portion hey guys how's it going so this

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.660 
portion hey guys how's it going so this
is<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.519> filter<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:04.120> used<00:04:04.389> it's<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.840> 3614<00:04:05.859> the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
is the filter I used it's the 3614 the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.800 
is the filter I used it's the 3614 the
reason<00:04:06.910> why<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> didn't<00:04:07.180> say<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.359> first<00:04:07.599> is

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
reason why I didn't say the first is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.470 
reason why I didn't say the first is
because<00:04:08.099> if<00:04:09.099> whether<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:09.639> buy<00:04:09.760> from<00:04:10.030> ultra

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
because if whether you buy from ultra

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.870 
because if whether you buy from ultra
are<00:04:10.630> just<00:04:10.780> regular<00:04:10.989> fram<00:04:11.440> oil<00:04:11.769> filter<00:04:12.370> it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
are just regular fram oil filter it

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.050 
are just regular fram oil filter it
always<00:04:13.359> is<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.889> 3614<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.160> X<00:04:15.280> G's<00:04:15.579> just<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
always is a 3614 the X G's just the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.009 
always is a 3614 the X G's just the
thing<00:04:16.750> for<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.200> ultra<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.039> then<00:04:18.280> there's<00:04:18.700> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
thing for the ultra and then there's a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.529 
thing for the ultra and then there's a
another<00:04:20.280> beginning<00:04:21.280> number<00:04:21.639> for<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.390> other

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
another beginning number for the other

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.860 
another beginning number for the other
so<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:23.200> look<00:04:23.320> for<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> 3614<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.659> have<00:04:25.750> this

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so just look for a 3614 if you have this

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.480 
so just look for a 3614 if you have this
one<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.169> have<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.320> 2.3<00:04:26.979> liter<00:04:27.159> I<00:04:27.220> believe

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
one if you have a 2.3 liter I believe

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.970 
one if you have a 2.3 liter I believe
it's<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.729> car

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
it's a car

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.050 
it's a car
filter<00:04:28.460> not<00:04:28.850> uh<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:31.370> one<00:04:31.550> which<00:04:31.670> is<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> full

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
filter not uh this one which is the full

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.660 
filter not uh this one which is the full
filter<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:33.140> you<00:04:33.200> have<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.350> 2.3<00:04:33.950> liter<00:04:34.130> Mazda

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
filter so if you have a 2.3 liter Mazda

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.160 
filter so if you have a 2.3 liter Mazda
3<00:04:34.970> then<00:04:35.150> you're<00:04:35.300> probably<00:04:35.390> going<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.750> need<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
3 then you're probably going to need the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.350 
3 then you're probably going to need the
other<00:04:36.200> one<00:04:36.740> which<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.520> just<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.820> cartridge<00:04:38.240> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
other one which is just a cartridge and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.310 
other one which is just a cartridge and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
then you have to get the cartridge

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.920 
then you have to get the cartridge
separator<00:04:39.830> which<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.190> annoying<00:04:40.400> but<00:04:40.930> anyways

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
separator which is annoying but anyways

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.970 
separator which is annoying but anyways
