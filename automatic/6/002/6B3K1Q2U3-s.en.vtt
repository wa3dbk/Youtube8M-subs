00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:14.400
 such an unexpected plot 9 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 September people begin to congratulate from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.210
 whole day with the holiday which they 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.980
 called the day tester 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 there is like, well, let me tell you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 the story of what, where is the holiday 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.059
 such what it means he suddenly even 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.989
 in russian wikipedia 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:37.199
 there are a couple of lines on this subject supposedly 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.210
 here it originates from the event 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.920
 who documented it when in 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 forty seventh year there they have there 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.629
 disagreements are there 45 47 but in american 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 Wikipedia is there exactly recorded it is just 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.420
 they did not read therefore their differences there 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.140
 tested no I did not test supposedly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 supposedly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 tested the computer and there moth 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 flew 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.880
 This and here known historical facts 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.590
 flew moth and stuck in the contacts 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 electromechanical relay 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.450
 here but well, respectively, we only 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.320
 removed in the journal made a record 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.420
 and a moth to say that the word woman is not 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.939
 does not characterize the moth 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.060
 actually moth have a friend another 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:32.170
 the word could but but not the essence wrote that here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.729
 there removed rich and respectively from 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.770
 this went debugging again 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.140
 and how somehow arose 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.140
 incredible connection here that is debugging this 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.459
 and there is testing and this and this is not true 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 but in this whole story there is some kind 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:53.110
 monstrous piling up nonsense matter in 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.299
 that the word tank was used in the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 very sense that's absolutely in the same 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.429
 very sense 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.289
 used good so let's say from 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.860
 today so probably there 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.399
 well for a hundred years thomas edison in 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.750
 himself 1878 he wrote there that he discovered 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.760
 bug in 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.379
 what 's out of their systems let's 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.959
 this means not every tank not every tank 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.730
 linked to the testing process in this 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.220
 case with this computer nobody anything 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.920
 did not test it worked and suddenly he 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 stopped working well so he stopped 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.640
 to work inside went get the bug out then 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.680
 There is of course some kind of diagnostics there 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 there was but diagnostics and testing it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
 completely different things besides we 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.610
 look uterine what people who 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.220
 consider this their holiday and consider 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.910
 they are their holiday in only in 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.150
 certain parts of the world that says 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.489
 on 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 we know only one language 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.910
 yes to everyone here on which I am with you now 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.260
 I communicate it only they have a holiday there 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.370
 because others don't even know what 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.739
 such a holiday exists and that means I 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.530
 not to mention that there is no 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.079
 but let's say the institutions that would 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 with his authority there before his 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.040
 Decision would declare it a holiday 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.900
 this is also not so guys there 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.209
 forums something they can still while 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.430
 a shot glass missed another third and 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.590
 somehow so they had other 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.690
 guys, too, so soon see how cool 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.100
 now they congratulate each other there but 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.530
 it means all the same let's see 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.720
 people who say this today are mine 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.950
 holiday is people who test 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.569
 software how 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.859
 Testing night it was not 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.709
 test how 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.569
 removing something from electromechanical 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.700
 relay relates to testing 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.040
 software is the first 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.400
 the second 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.730
 people who work in this profession 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.739
 these are not people who remove errors or 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.870
 there errors are detected in the system 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.260
 which suddenly stopped working it 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.420
 people who find problems 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.170
 software inconsistencies 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.220
 in the process of developing it but software 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.040
 software is not a piece of iron I'm not talking about 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.160
 tom that word there de bou gintama but she 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.320
 present in aviation systems 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.269
 there and in the forties before and so 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.610
 further then 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.139
 dayan harper who is that word there 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.449
 used here regarding this 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.070
 computer and for them there it is in the log 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.990
 It was brought in, she also said that she 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.360
 did not try to create any term she 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.289
 used the existing term 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.900
 there is this kind of nonsense squared it 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.330
 some kind of apotheosis of nonsense here 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.930
 this holiday and all that with it 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.090
 related 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.280
 and where did he come from and I want to say 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.530
 let's take it as day 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.419
 tester and at the same time and all 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.199
 computer scientists first day when 5700 74 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.820
 years ago 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.000
 if we are on today's calendar 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.599
 translate it will be there on August 31 when 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.199
 god divided light and darkness guys this is the same 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.090
 weiner technology binary technology 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.849
 therefore, there used to be no 0 and one 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.270
 or is there 0 and minus one and suddenly god 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.340
 said that day it will be 0 and the night will be 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.530
 minus one and you can test 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.570
 I apologize for using the word 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.880
 testing in this context you can 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.320
 close your eyes and see minus one 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.129
 you will be dark 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.379
 prom open your eyes certainly need 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.749
 day or night open your eyes and suddenly you 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.509
 see a light or a light bulb turn on with it 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.459
 experiment this is that moment 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.979
 when computer technologies came into being 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:41.050
 exactly five thousand seven hundred 74 years ago 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.330
 the fact that many people do not believe that it was 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.459
 at this time it is that science says that in 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.119
 this time there was nothing like that 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:51.159
 and so on yes but this is already such 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:53.889
 insignificant fact let's get this 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:56.409
 good reason well or let's take i don't 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.089
 I know there we take the day they started 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.569
 classes in tailors computer school though 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:04.569
 they are much more relevant to the event 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:08.499
 what is allowed there separation of light and darkness 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.779
 but what I want to say is not a holiday 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:13.479
 for people who are seriously engaged 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:16.959
 Professionals Software Tester 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.329
 ensure this is a holiday and people who 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.399
 did not understand but it happens like this 

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:24.729
 he has a position and he did not understand 

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:26.619
 I remember the time when the middle 90 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.479
 We already had a school and already guys went 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:30.610
 job search and most people 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.959
 who interviewed them themselves in 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.360
 testing has not worked them yet 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:36.550
 turn over from the equipment from the hulls yet 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.159
 where did the boss put the un 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.329
 interviews from those of whom interior 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.569
 stages of our graduates 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:45.669
 learn testing learn how 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.229
 Now it is our is it that these 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.899
 there is no you should here where he would 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.639
 even the tester finn program is just another 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.529
 do not know 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.019
 so I really hope that people 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:57.639
 who work in the profession is not important 

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:00.449
 somewhere in Russia in Ukraine there still 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:03.729
 somewhere they are subdivided here and 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.319
 laugh at the fact that here is someone 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.990
 Now this could be considered there 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.519
 some holidays that's why if 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.780
 man let's say that today 

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.400
 and 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.440
 course there read somewhere went there 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.110
 congratulated someone is nothing terrible 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.110
 but in the end it never happens, but 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.330
 if you already work in a profession not 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.510
 it is necessary to do this that is, we will spend 5 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.990
 minutes see understand what's what and all 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:32.020
 Well this is not something that someone hid nothing 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.700
 this is not here so I would like this 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.100
 reacted to this holiday are only 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.690
 congratulated thanks to them i will understand it from 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.770
 pure heart and no problems 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:45.580
 there is no but all the same 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.320
 for clarification like a question i would i 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.630
 said that if you work in the profession 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.430
 no need no need this not this not very 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.490
 ok then there are some people can 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:57.930
 think that you are still not really 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.930
 professions including his guys
