00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.990 
only be $22 so the only reason why it's
more<00:01:57.159> expensive<00:01:57.310> than<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.640> other<00:01:57.790> one<00:01:57.970> is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
more expensive than the other one is

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.609 
more expensive than the other one is
because<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.509> has<00:01:58.540> writing<00:01:59.079> on<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.259> front<00:01:59.530> in

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
because it has writing on the front in

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.690 
because it has writing on the front in
the<00:01:59.710> back<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.189> they<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.430> like<00:02:00.549> flip

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
the back and so they have to like flip

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.370 
the back and so they have to like flip
the<00:02:00.850> shirt<00:02:01.030> over<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.450> reorient<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.079> stuff

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
the shirt over and reorient it and stuff

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.230 
the shirt over and reorient it and stuff
so<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:03.130> can<00:02:03.280> be<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:03.490> any<00:02:03.640> kind<00:02:03.820> of<00:02:03.909> shirt<00:02:04.090> that

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
so it can be on any kind of shirt that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.480 
so it can be on any kind of shirt that
you<00:02:04.270> want<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.810> can<00:02:04.960> be<00:02:05.110> on<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:06.430> much
