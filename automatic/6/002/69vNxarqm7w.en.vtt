00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
go through to the back so stitched onto

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
go through to the back so stitched onto
the<00:01:49.020> first<00:01:49.259> sheet<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.430> two<00:01:50.640> sheets<00:01:50.909> are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
stitched together or in the side so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
stitched together or in the side so
let's<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.610> i'll<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:59.119> put<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's see i'll show you how to put the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.709 
let's see i'll show you how to put the
back<00:02:00.479> frame<00:02:01.159> inside<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> pack<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.060> we'll

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
back frame inside the pack and we'll

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.040 
back frame inside the pack and we'll
follow<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> basic<00:02:04.170> instructions

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.500 

so<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.200> insert<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> pack<00:02:09.860> frame<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.300> just

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so to insert the pack frame we can just

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.650 
so to insert the pack frame we can just
turn<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> top<00:02:12.260> part<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.590> bag<00:02:12.770> out<00:02:13.660> like

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
turn the top part of the bag out like

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.420 
turn the top part of the bag out like
this<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:16.400> helps<00:02:16.730> expose<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.270> pocket<00:02:20.410> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
this this helps expose the pocket and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.770 
this this helps expose the pocket and
start<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> insert<00:02:23.410> frame<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.390> little<00:02:26.660> bit

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
start to insert frame it's a little bit

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.100 
start to insert frame it's a little bit
difficult<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.470> get<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.740> started<00:02:29.110> so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
difficult just to get it started so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.360 
difficult just to get it started so
we'll<00:02:30.320> slide<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:33.050> slide<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.070> down<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
we'll slide it in and slide it down to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
we'll slide it in and slide it down to
the<00:02:34.459> bottom

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.400 

and<00:02:41.650> there<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.780> bars<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.379> be

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
and there we have it the bars can be

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.390 
and there we have it the bars can be
fitted<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.890> now<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.519> or<00:02:46.080> afterwards

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
fitted in now if you like or afterwards

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.780 
fitted in now if you like or afterwards
so<00:02:48.629> I'll<00:02:49.629> fit<00:02:49.840> mine<00:02:50.019> afterwards<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:51.550> just

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
so I'll fit mine afterwards they just

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.350 
so I'll fit mine afterwards they just
slide<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.830> like<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:56.590> each<00:02:56.709> side<00:02:57.360> but

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
slide in like this one each side but

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.940 
slide in like this one each side but
I'll<00:02:58.540> leave<00:02:58.720> them<00:02:58.900> out<00:02:59.050> because<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.470> makes<00:02:59.500> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
I'll leave them out because it makes the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.949 
I'll leave them out because it makes the
back<00:03:00.610> frame<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.910> little<00:03:01.150> bit<00:03:01.269> more<00:03:01.420> flexible

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
back frame a little bit more flexible

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.830 
back frame a little bit more flexible
for<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:03.040> second<00:03:03.400> part<00:03:03.580> which<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.540> get<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
for this second part which is to get the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.910 
for this second part which is to get the
top<00:03:05.140> part<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.560> pack<00:03:05.769> frame<00:03:06.450> underneath<00:03:07.450> here

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
top part of pack frame underneath here

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.070 
top part of pack frame underneath here
so<00:03:08.920> we'll<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.310> end<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.000> down<00:03:11.220> slide<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.250> in

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
so we'll just end it down slide it in

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:29.130 
so we'll just end it down slide it in
can<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.170> sliding<00:03:14.470> across

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.460 

and<00:03:29.740> then<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.070> goes<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.780> now<00:03:34.930> we<00:03:34.990> can<00:03:35.170> insert

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
and then it goes in so now we can insert

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:49.860 
and then it goes in so now we can insert
the<00:03:35.790> aluminum<00:03:36.790> bars<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.480> like

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.649 

just<00:03:50.470> like<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:52.560> mr.<00:03:53.560> Peck<00:03:53.739> frame<00:03:53.950> inserted

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
just like that mr. Peck frame inserted

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.149 
just like that mr. Peck frame inserted
I've<00:03:55.659> noticed<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.319> bars<00:03:56.530> hold<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
I've noticed that the bars hold the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.800 
I've noticed that the bars hold the
bottom<00:03:57.430> two-thirds<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.360> back<00:03:58.540> frame

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
bottom two-thirds of the back frame

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.410 
bottom two-thirds of the back frame
rigid<00:03:59.250> allows<00:04:00.250> this<00:04:00.519> top<00:04:00.760> section<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.330> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
rigid allows this top section of the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.390 
rigid allows this top section of the
pack<00:04:01.629> to<00:04:03.930> still<00:04:04.930> move<00:04:05.170> which<00:04:05.890> would<00:04:06.069> allow<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
pack to still move which would allow the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.240 
pack to still move which would allow the
shoulder<00:04:07.390> straps<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.780> those<00:04:08.530> top<00:04:08.860> part<00:04:09.099> of<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
shoulder straps to those top part of the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.100 
shoulder straps to those top part of the
pack<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.760> wrap<00:04:10.360> around<00:04:10.390> your<00:04:10.690> shoulders<00:04:11.079> a

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
pack to wrap around your shoulders a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.660 
pack to wrap around your shoulders a
little<00:04:11.290> bit

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
little bit

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.550 
little bit
I'm<00:04:12.670> sure<00:04:12.879> that's<00:04:13.150> why<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.049> designed<00:04:14.379> like

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
I'm sure that's why it's designed like

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.620 
I'm sure that's why it's designed like
that<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:14.950> these<00:04:15.549> bars<00:04:15.849> don't<00:04:16.060> come<00:04:16.329> right<00:04:16.510> to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that and these bars don't come right to

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.140 
that and these bars don't come right to
the<00:04:16.660> very<00:04:16.810> top<00:04:17.699> hope<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.820> found<00:04:19.000> this
