 newyorkino born in prague was the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.860
 adventure in the day of hundreds of thousands 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.220
 of very young Americans are 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.540
 they huddled on the amphibious barges 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 of the beaches of normandy 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.140
 the terror accompanied them to the sound of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 bursts of defenses bombs 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.650
 many German women threw up breakfast in

 sidewalks but nobody complained about it 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.260
 their minds did not have time to think 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 in those minutiae among those guys 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.890
 cappa shuddered her cameras 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 again and again as if the ritual of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.360
 work could reach the noise 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.780
 thunderous of enemy cannon fire and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.270
 Suddenly a sharp blow shook the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.510
 indicated that they had reached 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.989
 the shore then the noise of the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.780
 bombs was thunderous but the sergeant to 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.190
 charge of that platoon shouted even more 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.330

 with the heart pumping at full speed 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.590
 the boys came stumbling 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.150
 his own legs but they kept the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.880
 stare in the back of his superior 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.600
 the worst would be to lose the sergeant his 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 only reliable guide in that hell the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.840
 confusion was huge platoons to the 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.970
 race everywhere shouting explosions 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.610
 layer went after them and did as the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 others throw themselves on the ground about 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.670
 twenty meters and stare at the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.090
