00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:28.939
 yes I am here at the lake in the southwest of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.830
 Berlin and I are doing a little one now 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 walk to the rake castle and on the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 away, I'll show you what leaves you from 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.170
 trees pick and eat everything and also 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.760
 hello always work in the musee 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.760
 go because I see it here 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.890
 the two 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.890
 earlier, of course, especially soft 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.860
 both of course tell the 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.860
 delicacy 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.790
 questionable 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.390
 delicious spring on a hike 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.790
 and a little walk 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 By the way, both are good 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.600
 tastes great 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.110
 I recommend you to your spring 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.450
 Walks often directly at 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.869
 trees a small snack 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 hold 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:45.820
 on one of my favorite delicious and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:50.590
 though hazelnut tasted whole 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.039
 especially when the leaves new guys 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 are a bit strong in the taste than 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.670
 the legs 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.649
 will suggest you try it yourself 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.369
 from how it all tastes and will be 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:12.280
 see what leaves you prefer to 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.280
 the leaves can reap good 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:22.790
 and I just put it on me now 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.590
 in the bag is relatively large look 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.129
 what we still find here if so here 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.129
 go on 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.360
 you are also great what is church 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.360
 gives a picture 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.370
 something austere and vital taste what 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.780
 Also not bad with bitter substances 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.210
 is the liver we generally eat too 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.880
 little the city stuff and that in 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.370
 our normal eating normal and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.370
 food no longer occurs 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.200
 the accident with 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.980
 its tree is well known for its 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.790
 big leaves, the horn said 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.790
 it tastes good 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.840
 Yes 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.640
 He is always pretty low there 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.640

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.489

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.489

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.060

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.950
 I'll take some with me 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.260
 So look what's over there 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.540
 a great color the color of spring 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.270
 lime 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:32.570
 These leaves are delicious 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:36.810
 Do not forget how to do nancy 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:41.010
 Of course, we always want to go from 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:46.440
 wegesrand put lax, so to speak 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:49.700
 me some really at home one 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.700
 then a little something 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.070
 Okay, let's continue 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.910
 we need 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.370
 big leaves to pick 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.969
 they taste 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.480
 they are pretty soft and greasy 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 delicious 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.940
 as I said also excellent 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.629
 you like to work on the water 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.629
 a little like so wet feet 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.550
 again 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.770
 and students even a little home 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.820
 today the taste a little spice 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.820
 as the normal beech 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400
 I 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.909
 ok goes on 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:55.350
 so now I'm up at the hoe 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:07:00.960
 castle me in front of the castle wall and that 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:03.120
 I see here ever vdv is not edible 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.729
 you can tell that already on the hook remains 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.460
 almost a bit rubbery plastic 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:10.650
 so do not invite to measure and 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:16.370
 That's why we should too 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:20.990
 do not do it that 's it from the trees 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.990
