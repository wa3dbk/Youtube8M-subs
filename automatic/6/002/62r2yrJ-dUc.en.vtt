00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 how you have your own world on yours 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.319
 upload minecraft server can show 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 I like you in this video 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.690
 hey my at the seat and in this video 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 I would like to show you like you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 your own world that is on your pc 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 upload to your server 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.269
 we need if scp or filezilla 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.910
 was already in another video 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 I suppose if SCP because it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.960
 because it just goes much faster and choose 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.950
 my server and give my here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.950
 password 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 so after I'm on my server 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.340
 There is now a possibility we go 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.579
 on the world folder and then have it here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 our world we can either 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.699
 delete or another tip we 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 create a new directory and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 For example, they call old yes old ones 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.140
 world now we can do our world here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.380
 move in and create a new one 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.850
 create a new folder that the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 Only world is written small 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.689
 Now we go into this folder and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.570
 want to upload our own world 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.369
 if we built them in minecraft 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.619
 we have to down on percent appdata 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.729
 percent go and go to the point 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.820
 minecraft folder 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.380
 Here we go to saves and take to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.369
 example, the sg map here we all pull 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 data in here and yes I do 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.180
 unfortunately not because my internet 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.450
 very slow so would the short 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.880
 with my rootserver go in here too 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.229
 I mean it goes here in the world folder 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:04.170
 briefly update and load them 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.000
 all the data up here now 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.479
 I also see you in another video 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.610
 we can explain more precisely here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.680
 then we update the data 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.329
 are on it 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.930
 can then restart our server 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:22.760
 and then have a new world many 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
