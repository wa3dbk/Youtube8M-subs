00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
at open Wan Kenobi in a slightly

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.810 
at open Wan Kenobi in a slightly
different<00:01:23.439> way<00:01:23.770> mainly<00:01:24.340> through<00:01:24.520> exploring

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
different way mainly through exploring

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.090 
different way mainly through exploring
his<00:01:25.030> relationship<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.780> Anakin<00:01:26.679> Skywalker

and seeing that they were like brothers

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.649 
and seeing that they were like brothers
it<00:01:29.649> will<00:01:29.829> have<00:01:30.039> more<00:01:30.280> impact<00:01:30.729> when<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.360> see

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659
