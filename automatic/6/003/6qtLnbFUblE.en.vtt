00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.440
 the images and comments below 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 speak of a three-volume sedan 4 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.700
 doors able to guarantee high levels 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.230
 performance of a sports car on the track but 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.300
 at the same time also a guide 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.410
 pleasant on everyday roads 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 favored by comfort and safety 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 the abbreviation abu rx and stia and brings us back to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 palmares of the subaro in the championships 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 World Rally Championships and above all to the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.850
 All-wheel drive technology is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 become a brand means one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 consolidated construction characteristic 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 for the brand of the pleiades the fourth 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.829
 generation of the ox race east and ai 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 presents some stylistic innovations that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 they bring it closer to the most popular sedans 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 of high-end new headlights 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 redesigned new bumper mask 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.970
 in femme on tel 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.890
 but above all the rear spoiler with 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.720
 aerodynamic stabilizer function 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 starting from 80 kilometers per hour 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.350
 at this point we pass from the words to the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.270
 facts but where you go alphonse without 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.429
 gloves gloves of the pilot this is the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.939
 machine that deserves them I'll treat you with 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.939
 gloves 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.510
 of course it is a four- door sedan 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.430
 doors, however, always remains outside the spa and 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.979
 so lets do things with 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.580
 other machines you can hardly 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.460
 do all this 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.480
 It is clear that it is meant for driving 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 also of every day therefore wanting 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.630
 leaving the management of the automatic 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.330
 differential and sp. system 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.050
 This you can not do 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 however, removing everything you can't do it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.230
 fun on the track of course certain that 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.220
 a parent who knows who maybe even 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.380
 men 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 I think that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 will become attached to the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.310
 just with mark absolutely 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.030
 nothing better than a circuit like 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.349
 that of vairano di vidigulfo il 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.860
 traced four - wheeler test for 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.129
 try the new driving qualities of 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 this subaru rx st reached the third 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.180
 generation 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.659
 in fact it is impressive to verify 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.980
 like changing settings 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.680
 of differential electronics e 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.099
 control unit the reaction of the machine 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.709
 be really different like having three 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.980
 different cars available under the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.980
 sit down 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.530
 300 horsepower 407 newton meter 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.170
 for 4,000 laps 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.390
 well they are values ​​that if in terms 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.040
 the super sports cars we can 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.769
 find something on the market even with 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 higher powers because no on the other 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.340
 part however it is really difficult 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.250
 difficult with this we don't want 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 absolutely make us think that we are i 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.730
 the best in the world did not like though 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.030
 on the other hand I said it is difficult 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.209
 find an equal car that succeeds i 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.120
 horses to pass it all on the ground 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.799
 with a dynamic like our car 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.859
 thanks to the many peculiarities of the product 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.189
 which in the end I want to say the substance is 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.340
 that making the horses be 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:10.879
 all used on the road well 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.790
 in short, formula 1 has always taught them 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.009
 struggle for the great powers it transmits 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.049
 to the earth therefore to have the performances 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.109
 us thanks to the boxster who then 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.419
 It keeps 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.770
 the car's very low center of gravity 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.719
 let's remember that this is a displacement 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.069
 of 2,500 but exactly 2500 cc with 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.069
 naturally turbo turbo intercooler 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.740
 motor the whole kinematic part that goes 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.599
 precisely the transmission transmission e 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.919
 especially symmetrical all wheel drive 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:45.840
 to say permanent all-wheel drive is 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.939
 this with doubt this mix causes that 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.340
 this car has very few 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.620
 rivals on the automotive scene in 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.330
 terms of dynamism 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.849
 yes he did have the luck and the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.340
 case of saying to do a test on 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.210
 wet and to evaluate precisely the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.810
 transfer behavior of 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.900
 pair between rear and front e 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.860
 therefore appreciate the differences in 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.050
 function of the command it distributes 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.120
 these values is a peculiarity of the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.349
 our car that no other in 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.419
 effects a central differential 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.449
 electronically managed mechanic 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.370
 this is a bit our tip of 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.159
 diamond known pride also because 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.330
 actually give the chance a 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.860
 pilot 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.099
 a driver who wants to use the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.050
 machine use in quotation marks in the 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.270
 true sense the approach in a very way 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.449
 very dynamic sportsman indeed 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.430
 have the possibility to check e 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.310
 manage what the transmission of 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.740
 front end torque at the rear axle is 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.069
 certainly a very important value e 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.509
 we are sure many will appreciate 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.969
 with alfonso lithium with which we have 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.479
 tried the machine together at some 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.389
 point we said this wars xst 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.900
 ai is a truffle machine since 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.849
 we are we are in the realm of rice no and 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.030
 what could be better than a risotto col 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:15.389
 truffle here we say that the vr xst ai is 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.250
 a truffle machine pulls like me 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.620
 like for two reasons first because the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.729
 I really like truffles and second thing 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.830
 because somehow every food on 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.449
 which one puts on truffle increases the value 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.520
 the value of the food itself and therefore of 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.270
 consequently this is a car of 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.270
 great value
