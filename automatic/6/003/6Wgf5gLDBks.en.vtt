00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
know we can make the balls we know we've

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.019 
know we can make the balls we know we've
got<00:00:26.869> hearts<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.560> champions<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:28.369> lines<00:00:28.640> but

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
got hearts like champions and lines but

got hearts like champions and lines but
we<00:00:29.540> want<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:29.989> be<00:00:30.110> consistent<00:00:30.470> get<00:00:30.829> rid<00:00:31.070> of

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
we want to be consistent get rid of

analytical systems we have diamond

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.810 
analytical systems we have diamond
systems<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:47.989> name<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.469> let's<00:00:49.339> get<00:00:49.579> that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
systems you name it so let's get that

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.729 
systems you name it so let's get that
down<00:00:50.089> today<00:00:50.570> I<00:00:50.600> want<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.050> talk<00:00:51.230> about<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
down today I want to talk about the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.979 
down today I want to talk about the
shooting<00:00:51.949> system<00:00:52.339> that's<00:00:52.969> basically<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:53.929> do

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
shooting system that's basically what do

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.130 
shooting system that's basically what do
I<00:00:54.079> do<00:00:54.140> before<00:00:54.559> every<00:00:54.920> shot<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:56.140> actually

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
I do before every shot and actually

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.560 
I do before every shot and actually
let's<00:00:57.589> say<00:00:57.800> not<00:00:58.339> the<00:00:58.579> pre<00:00:58.820> shot<00:00:59.030> routine<00:00:59.089> but

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
let's say not the pre shot routine but

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.750 
let's say not the pre shot routine but
when<00:01:00.109> I'm<00:01:00.320> actually<00:01:00.559> shooting<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.370> shot<00:01:01.579> my

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
when I'm actually shooting the shot my

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.560 
when I'm actually shooting the shot my
shooting<00:01:02.210> system<00:01:03.100> all<00:01:04.100> right<00:01:04.280> here<00:01:04.550> we<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.790> I'm

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
shooting system all right here we go I'm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.350 
shooting system all right here we go I'm
going<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.140> make<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> decision<00:01:06.610> I'm<00:01:07.610> looking<00:01:08.270> at

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
going to make a decision I'm looking at

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.390 
going to make a decision I'm looking at
this<00:01:08.480> one<00:01:08.690> ball<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.170> want<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.920> make<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.220> one

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
this one ball I want to make the one

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.340 
this one ball I want to make the one
ball<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.790> corner<00:01:11.090> pocket<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.659> I<00:01:12.110> want<00:01:12.290> to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
ball in that corner pocket and I want to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.380 
ball in that corner pocket and I want to
hit<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.500> with<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.650> high<00:01:12.920> ball<00:01:13.159> come<00:01:13.850> across<00:01:14.150> it's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
hit it with a high ball come across it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.780 
hit it with a high ball come across it's
tangent<00:01:14.810> line<00:01:14.990> hook<00:01:15.560> forward<00:01:16.010> get<00:01:16.490> right

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
tangent line hook forward get right

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.620 
tangent line hook forward get right
around<00:01:16.970> this<00:01:17.330> 13<00:01:17.810> ball<00:01:18.160> okay<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:20.210> once<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.570> do

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
around this 13 ball okay so once I do

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.320 
around this 13 ball okay so once I do
that<00:01:21.100> I'm<00:01:22.100> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.370> find<00:01:22.670> my<00:01:22.880> smallest

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
that I'm going to find my smallest

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.510 
that I'm going to find my smallest
target<00:01:23.810> which<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:24.560> there<00:01:27.520> basically

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
target which is right there basically

target which is right there basically
aiming<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:30.880> once<00:01:31.880> I've<00:01:32.060> got<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.450> aim<00:01:32.720> where

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
aiming and once I've got that aim where

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.900 
aiming and once I've got that aim where
my<00:01:33.560> cue<00:01:33.860> ball<00:01:34.010> is<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.340> right<00:01:34.520> into<00:01:34.700> that

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910

looking at a face exactly at 12 o'clock

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.430 
looking at a face exactly at 12 o'clock
or<00:04:12.610> at<00:04:12.640> exactly<00:04:13.090> at<00:04:13.300> 11<00:04:13.660> o'clock<00:04:13.750> wherever<00:04:14.230> we

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
or at exactly at 11 o'clock wherever we

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.259 
or at exactly at 11 o'clock wherever we
want<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.739> hit<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.220> we're<00:04:15.970> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.120> make

want to hit it and we're going to make

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.840 
want to hit it and we're going to make
sure<00:04:16.450> every<00:04:17.109> stroke<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.769> not<00:04:18.070> only<00:04:18.220> even<00:04:18.700> in

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
sure every stroke is not only even in

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.970 
sure every stroke is not only even in
length<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.959> it's<00:04:20.140> staying<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.739> its

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
length but that it's staying on its

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.820 
length but that it's staying on its
intended<00:04:21.340> track<00:04:21.669> going<00:04:21.970> backward<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.690> on<00:04:23.680> its

intended<00:04:24.160> track<00:04:24.460> going<00:04:24.669> forward<00:04:25.150> it's

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
intended track going forward it's

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.170 
intended track going forward it's
important<00:04:26.470> every<00:04:27.160> one<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.310> these<00:04:27.460> details<00:04:27.910> we

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
important every one of these details we

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.620 
important every one of these details we
practice<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.810> lifetime<00:04:29.190> all<00:04:30.190> right<00:04:30.630> so
