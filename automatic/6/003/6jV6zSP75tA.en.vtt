00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
furnace like an oil furnace is to make

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
furnace like an oil furnace is to make
sure<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> flue<00:00:43.860> gases<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.579> escape<00:00:44.910> flue

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
sure that the flue gases can escape flue

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
sure that the flue gases can escape flue
gases<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:46.020> what's<00:00:46.350> left<00:00:46.410> over<00:00:46.920> after<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
gases are what's left over after the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
gases are what's left over after the
fuel<00:00:47.550> burns<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.300> carbon<00:00:48.899> monoxide<00:00:49.020> carbon

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
fuel burns so carbon monoxide carbon

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.770 
fuel burns so carbon monoxide carbon
dioxide<00:00:49.920> some<00:00:50.520> water<00:00:50.760> vapor<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.629> other

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
dioxide some water vapor and some other

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.090 
dioxide some water vapor and some other
things<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.680> sure<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
things you want to make sure that that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
things you want to make sure that that
gas<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.670> move<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> flue<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gas can move up the flue and to the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
gas can move up the flue and to the
outside<00:00:55.469> without<00:00:55.649> escaping<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> house

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
outside without escaping into the house

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
outside without escaping into the house
so<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.449> want<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> visually<00:00:58.199> inspect<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.859> flue

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so you want to visually inspect the flue

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
so you want to visually inspect the flue
pipe<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> look<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.180> corroded<00:01:00.600> parts<00:01:00.930> holes

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pipe and look for corroded parts holes

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.959 
pipe and look for corroded parts holes
anything<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> hole

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
anything like that if you see a hole

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
anything like that if you see a hole
corroded<00:01:03.390> section<00:01:03.780> you'll<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> replace

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
corroded section you'll want to replace

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
corroded section you'll want to replace
that<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:05.939> small

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that but if you just see some small

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
that but if you just see some small
holes<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.810> tape<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.740> some

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
holes you can tape those up with some

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.580 
holes you can tape those up with some
foil<00:01:08.189> tape<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.360> case<00:01:09.600> our<00:01:09.840> flue<00:01:10.409> looks

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
foil tape in this case our flue looks

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.800 
foil tape in this case our flue looks
like<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.100> shape<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.570> do

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
like it's in good shape now if you do

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
like it's in good shape now if you do
ever<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.350> leakage<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.070> flue<00:01:14.250> gases<00:01:14.610> into

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
ever have a leakage of flue gases into

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.859 
ever have a leakage of flue gases into
the<00:01:14.850> home<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.360> very<00:01:15.570> dangerous

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the home it can be very dangerous

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
the home it can be very dangerous
because<00:01:16.380> carbon<00:01:17.159> monoxide<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> particular<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
because carbon monoxide in particular is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
because carbon monoxide in particular is
odorless<00:01:18.900> colorless<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.100> kill<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
odorless colorless and it can kill you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.359 
odorless colorless and it can kill you
so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> keep<00:01:21.659> carbon<00:01:22.259> monoxide<00:01:22.830> alarms

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
so I like to keep carbon monoxide alarms

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.399 
so I like to keep carbon monoxide alarms
in<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> areas<00:01:24.390> where<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.720> family<00:01:25.049> sleeps

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
in all the areas where my family sleeps

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
in all the areas where my family sleeps
but<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> keep<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.460> carbon<00:01:26.759> monoxide<00:01:26.850> alarm

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
but also I keep a carbon monoxide alarm

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
but also I keep a carbon monoxide alarm
in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.960> basement<00:01:28.380> where<00:01:28.470> my<00:01:28.590> furnace<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
in the basement where my furnace is that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
in the basement where my furnace is that
way<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:29.939> ever<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> leak<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> carbon

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
way there's ever a leak of carbon

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
way there's ever a leak of carbon
monoxide<00:01:30.960> I'll<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.420> maintenance

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
monoxide I'll know now one maintenance

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
monoxide I'll know now one maintenance

changing the filter on their system and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.990 
changing the filter on their system and
you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.560> lots<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> choices<00:01:37.920> once<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> figure
