how<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.980> catch<00:00:11.219> shrimp

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.640 

as<00:00:54.850> you<00:00:55.120> can<00:00:55.240> see<00:00:55.480> as<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.870> pull<00:00:56.080> on<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.290> casting

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
as you can see as I pull on the casting

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.260 
as you can see as I pull on the casting
net<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:57.010> kind<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.340> jerked<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.850> rope

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
net I kind of jerked the rope

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.240 
net I kind of jerked the rope
what<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.840> does<00:00:59.110> is<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.350> pops<00:00:59.890> up<00:01:00.130> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
what that does is that pops up the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.520 
what that does is that pops up the
casting<00:01:00.760> net<00:01:00.940> which<00:01:01.450> pulls<00:01:01.780> all<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.200> shrimp

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
casting net which pulls all the shrimp

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.590 
casting net which pulls all the shrimp
off<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.070> bottom<00:01:03.460> which<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.180> where<00:01:04.480> they

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
off the bottom which is where they

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.390 
off the bottom which is where they
normally<00:01:05.080> like<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:05.350> hang<00:01:05.560> out<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.950> grasses

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
normally like to hang out in the grasses

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.460 
normally like to hang out in the grasses
and<00:01:06.520> stuff<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:07.210> grabs<00:01:07.660> them<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:07.990> pulls<00:01:08.260> them

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
and stuff it grabs them and pulls them

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.260 
and stuff it grabs them and pulls them
off<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.770> bottom<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.370> ensure<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.060> I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
off the bottom so I can ensure that I

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.790 
off the bottom so I can ensure that I
get<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.570> most<00:01:10.600> shrimp<00:01:11.050> that<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.440> possibly

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
get the most shrimp that I can possibly

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.310 
get the most shrimp that I can possibly
get<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.760> makes<00:01:13.210> sure<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.570> suck<00:01:13.900> all<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
get and it makes sure to suck all the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.690 
get and it makes sure to suck all the
ones<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.680> are<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:15.010> holding<00:01:15.550> down

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
ones that are really holding down

00:01:15.700 --> 00:02:01.610
