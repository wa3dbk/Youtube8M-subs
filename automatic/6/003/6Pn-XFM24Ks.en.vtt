00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
Powell product I had met Eric Keller and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.999 
Powell product I had met Eric Keller and
Eric<00:01:31.229> told<00:01:31.470> me<00:01:31.650> about<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:33.030> had<00:01:33.329> no<00:01:33.630> idea

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
Eric told me about it and I had no idea

Eric told me about it and I had no idea
that<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.040> had<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> durability<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> did

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that it had the durability that it did

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350

and<00:01:37.439> once<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> learned<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.329> thought

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and once I learned about it I thought

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.140 
and once I learned about it I thought
this<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> great<00:01:40.079> application<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.939> put

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
this was a great application so we put

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.679 
this was a great application so we put
it<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> truck<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.240> fabrication<00:01:45.240> shop

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
of perhaps getting damaged on the boat

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.200 
of perhaps getting damaged on the boat
in<00:01:54.350> transit<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:56.009> transportation<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:57.000> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
went over the start line with it and it

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
went over the start line with it and it
looked<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.099> really

impressive was there weren't any bubbles
or<00:02:14.010> places<00:02:14.730> where<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.930> peeling<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.910> but

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
or places where it was peeling up but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.440 
or places where it was peeling up but
what<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.959> most<00:02:19.440> impressive<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> after

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
what was most impressive was that after

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.680 
what was most impressive was that after
six<00:02:21.900> thousand<00:02:22.350> miles<00:02:22.560> we<00:02:23.250> peeled<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
six thousand miles we peeled the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.010 
six thousand miles we peeled the
urethane<00:02:25.020> expel<00:02:25.770> off<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.390> truck<00:02:27.690> looked

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
urethane expel off and the truck looked

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.630 
urethane expel off and the truck looked
brand<00:02:28.440> new<00:02:28.709> when<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.100> went<00:02:29.280> over<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> finish

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
brand new when we went over the finish

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
brand new when we went over the finish
line<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:31.459> made<00:02:32.459> for<00:02:32.730> great<00:02:32.970> pictures<00:02:33.870> but

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
line and made for great pictures but

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
line and made for great pictures but
again<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.280> me<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:36.540> was<00:02:36.690> really<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.959> safety

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
again for me it was really a safety

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
again for me it was really a safety
feature<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.310> durability<00:02:38.760> feature<00:02:39.270> because

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
feature and a durability feature because

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.180 
feature and a durability feature because
after<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.320> put<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.400> much<00:02:41.640> time<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:43.190> that

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
after we put that much time and that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.729 
after we put that much time and that
much<00:02:44.370> money<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.810> had<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.170> many<00:02:46.290> sponsors

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
