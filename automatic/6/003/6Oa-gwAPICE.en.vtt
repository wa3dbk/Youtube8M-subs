 hello to all today we have the honor of interviewing your eminence on 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.909
 cardinal ravasi president of the pontifical council for culture 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.170
 about his new book, what a man is 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.989
 feelings and legs and hands in the bible 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.179
 that we have the pleasure to present you on the website libreriacoletti.it 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.179
 microcosm of feeling pet universe of bonds these are the two poles around the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.249
 which develops his book 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.680
 lady dissects from the biblical data 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 summarizing it is possible to outline a biblical anthropology that is capable of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 say something also to the human sciences 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.270
 I think it is impossible to answer this question which is moreover 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.540
 particularly challenging because every time you look in some 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.570
 way to outline 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.900
 a great cultural figure of tradition 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.299
 important text forum gigi 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.649
 I must always remember that it is not only the sun but also in the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:06.350
 her 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.420
 communication that is in its development in the infusion that has had nothing, I am 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.640
 we think what an odyssey has meant for Western culture 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 we think about it. justify the bible is difficult because the bible 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.510
 uninterruptedly 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.939
 present vigilant 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.980
 almost 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.420
 and uniss on me nintendo presence - history and western culture I would think

 model like that topology a place near two elements of this user. 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.500
 tap to one side 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.920
 certainly the dimension of freedom 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 in fact immediately the initial presentation is that of the new solitaire in the shade 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.200
 of the tree of the knowledge of good and of evil evident moral symbol 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.790
 in which the man must contain choice of decision 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.400
 getting the moral oo 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.590
 building the compass only tears 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.470
 and on the other internal part of the preemption, in fact still in this 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 initial presentation of the writing 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.769
 man is not a solitary being indeed 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.919
 lighting takes place through a series of pre-emption 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:25.579
 upwards towards God tells you the breath of the life of peace 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.349
 down the animals but that is legal newsstand vicenza work 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.639
 and above all the terminal point when horizontally after the eyes in the 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.519
 eyes 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.459
 he meets his woman I tear to pieces 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.609
 here are these two components deemed to be a map down payment 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.609
 for anthropology 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.129
 feelings the human bond that like me ampere you are not always positive 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.559
 the humanity that emerges from the sacred and often violent scriptures is negative 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.559
 I am thinking in particular of Psalm 108 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:09.229
 believes that the sacred page warns of the negativity inherent in the 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.229
 folds of the human one offers a hermeneutical key 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:19.579
 eldo d amour surely to remember that l &amp; scripture those who are constituted 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.189
 from 73 books that speak 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.199
 perspectives is the manifold 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.319
 the designer 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.939
 - mostly 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.260
 but there is a common thread that unites them 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.479
 and this guiding thread allows pee a to answer this question 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.919
 electric service bed 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.209
 now to say an interpretation of sex ultimora 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.359
 eritrea to which we must recognize that both these things are present but 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.150
 this thread above all 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.890
 @ 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.589
 until one acid industry 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.879
 the thread is that of the historicity of the writing 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.039
 who evidently 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.389
 begins to consider the nation lawn Christian stability of immediately 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.409
 affirm that a revelation I am 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.009
 in this it is distinguished for example from the Muslim revelation 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.680
 the coral its nature with mac tale of its communication is something that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.569
 gets out of the car that is even placed on a felt pad on the mouth 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.520
 of the prophet of boffalora d'adda 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.199
 maometto who does not receive from 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.120
 recent documents announced by the municipality of Trento wineries 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.809
 previous link. 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.809
 the revelation of the Christian secret you 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.169
 the presence 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.979
 of a god who reveals himself as manifested as this can be 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.150
 religion but 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.760
 within the text crossroads 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.029
 passing through 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.729
 human affairs 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.760
 and we could say that almost at the corner 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.010
 of the road you have at the corner of the houses chagall in this broad sense. very well 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.850
 this 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.389
 psychology in sensitivity 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.240
 when 7 moves meet 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.860
 in the steering square the village held the angels for me as a prize 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.220
 they are davide chimneys telereggiocalabria 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.190
 that is, the king of the village always beautiful daily reality in reality 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.440
 every day you insert this word and then at this point you can understand 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.889
 as on one side 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.969
 and certainly the attempt to show any sense of a path 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.419
 this story was supposed to 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.770
 although here artistically commander disillusionment bend and on the other side 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.380
 eh is completely indifferent to this tragedy with the voice of 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.070
 site of the home for the elderly 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.440
 that intellectually remembers 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.740
 yes you have to bring the story of his possession you have to carry with common god 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.059
 with your conversion, we do not forget, we do not forget 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:04.990
 that the first that says so to say of Jesus 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.970
 and in Matthew's Gospel he has only two words, the kingdom of God is near you 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.009
 converted 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.940
 the conversion appeals the type that is addressed 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.410
 because in the kingdom of god which is a serious story
