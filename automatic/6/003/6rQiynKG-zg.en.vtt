00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
blue part is actually like bodyboard

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.130 
blue part is actually like bodyboard
kind<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> material<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
kind of material so it's not like the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
kind of material so it's not like the
other<00:00:43.290> soft<00:00:43.620> tops<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.030> if

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
other soft tops it's I don't know if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.990 
other soft tops it's I don't know if
it's<00:00:45.210> me<00:00:45.329> about<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> quarter<00:00:45.750> inch<00:00:45.780> dick<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's me about a quarter inch dick or so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's me about a quarter inch dick or so
what<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> found<00:00:48.270> though<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> sides

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
what I found though is that on the sides

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.279 
what I found though is that on the sides
of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> rails<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.660> bang

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of the rails on this thing if you bang

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
of the rails on this thing if you bang
it<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.829> slicing<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> paddles

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it a lot or slicing with the paddles

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
it a lot or slicing with the paddles
then<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.300> tends<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.309> slices

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
then it tends to get these little slices

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.510 
then it tends to get these little slices
so<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> rail<00:00:58.079> guard<00:00:58.440> type<00:00:58.770> material

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
so we put the rail guard type material

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.990 
so we put the rail guard type material
which<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.449> XM<00:01:01.020> surf<00:01:01.789> traction<00:01:02.789> deck

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
which is actually XM surf traction deck

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
which is actually XM surf traction deck
but<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.899> feet<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.439> these<00:01:04.589> little

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but at what feet they make these little

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.230 
but at what feet they make these little
strips<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.519> put<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> rail<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
strips and you can put it on the rail so

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.969 
strips and you can put it on the rail so
we<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.600> how<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.500> works<00:01:07.770> out

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
we want to see how this this works out

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.270 
we want to see how this this works out
it<00:01:08.820> already<00:01:09.090> comes<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.720> handles<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it already comes with the handles so you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
it already comes with the handles so you
get<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> handle<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> handle<00:01:13.080> on

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
get a handle here you get a handle on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.679 
get a handle here you get a handle on
both<00:01:13.619> sides<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> nose<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
both sides and then in the nose and the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
both sides and then in the nose and the
tail<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.500> thinking<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.979> maybe

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
tail what I was thinking is that maybe

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.719 
tail what I was thinking is that maybe
there<00:01:18.360> should<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:19.200> another<00:01:19.729> handle

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
there should actually be another handle

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
there should actually be another handle
somewhere<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> UM<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
somewhere up here in the UM in the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
somewhere up here in the UM in the
middle<00:01:23.640> front<00:01:24.540> area<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
middle front area not not so much in the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.999 
middle front area not not so much in the
total<00:01:26.460> front<00:01:26.790> area<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.650> when<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.950> my

it's not so tippy going front to back

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's not so tippy going front to back
but<00:01:44.700> i<00:01:45.000> figured<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.079> i<00:01:46.170> put<00:01:46.380> something<00:01:46.829> maybe

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
but i figured if i put something maybe

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
but i figured if i put something maybe
about<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.860> rig<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.549> seat

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
about here then we could rig up a seat

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.289 
about here then we could rig up a seat
or<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.860> son<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.070> sit<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> front<00:01:53.759> on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
or so my son can sit in the front on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
or so my son can sit in the front on
that<00:01:54.360> part<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.049> i<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.649> stand<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that part and that i can stand more you

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
that part and that i can stand more you
know<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:58.200> into<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
know in the back and then get into the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.520 
know in the back and then get into the
tail<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.920> gotta<00:01:59.210> try<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.240> um<00:02:00.509> turn<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
tail if I gotta try and um turn so I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.569 
tail if I gotta try and um turn so I
haven't<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.860> haven't<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.250> written<00:02:02.399> this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
haven't I haven't really written this

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.740 
haven't I haven't really written this
thing<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.820> waves<00:02:03.030> yet<00:02:03.270> i'm<00:02:03.360> gonna<00:02:03.509> try<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
thing in waves yet i'm gonna try it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.370 
thing in waves yet i'm gonna try it
today<00:02:03.979> hopefully<00:02:04.979> um<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
today hopefully um and see how that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.369 
today hopefully um and see how that
works<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.940> as<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.869> thick<00:02:10.110> black

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
works but as of this kind of thick black

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.080 
works but as of this kind of thick black
foam<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.069> hope<00:02:11.280> i<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.849> whole<00:02:12.030> thing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
foam this hope i think this whole thing

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.630 
foam this hope i think this whole thing
is<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.810> phone

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
is is a phone

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.640 
is is a phone
so<00:02:13.819> boom<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.240> get<00:02:14.330> hit<00:02:14.510> by<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.720> no<00:02:14.990> problem<00:02:15.440> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
so boom you get hit by it no problem and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.760 
so boom you get hit by it no problem and
then<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:16.819> underneath<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:18.530> pretty

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
then if you look underneath just pretty

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.280 
then if you look underneath just pretty
simple<00:02:19.130> single<00:02:19.700> fin<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:20.720> material

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
simple single fin and then this material

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.980 
simple single fin and then this material
right<00:02:21.440> here<00:02:22.060> let<00:02:23.060> me<00:02:23.209> flip<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.540> thing<00:02:23.690> over

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
right here let me flip this thing over

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.670 
right here let me flip this thing over
this<00:02:24.830> material<00:02:25.459> right<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.440> bottom

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
this material right here on the bottom

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.540 
this material right here on the bottom
is<00:02:28.130> actually<00:02:28.880> kind<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.330> soft<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.100> it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
is actually kind of soft so if you it's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.340 
is actually kind of soft so if you it's
not<00:02:31.670> hardened<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.209> your<00:02:32.330> it's<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:33.230> just

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
not hardened to your it's like it's just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.610 
not hardened to your it's like it's just
like<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.530> bodyboard<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.360> we'll<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.990> how<00:02:36.200> this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
like a bodyboard so we'll see how this

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.110 
like a bodyboard so we'll see how this
thing<00:02:36.830> works<00:02:36.860> out<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.459> really<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.940> this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
thing works out but I really like this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.020 
thing works out but I really like this
and<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:39.440> fun<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:39.860> tandem<00:02:40.100> two<00:02:40.489> adults<00:02:40.760> can

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
and it's fun to go tandem two adults can

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.479 
and it's fun to go tandem two adults can
go<00:02:41.120> tan<00:02:41.300> them<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.720> as<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.709> kids<00:02:43.130> and

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
go tan them on it as well as kids and

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.150 
go tan them on it as well as kids and
and<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.900> board<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.290> real<00:02:45.560> fun<00:02:45.830> too<00:02:46.130> on

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and so on this board is real fun too on

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.610 
and so on this board is real fun too on
the<00:02:46.430> tail<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.180> step<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.690> tail<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.500> make

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the tail you step on the tail to make

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.350 
the tail you step on the tail to make
that<00:02:48.770> kick<00:02:48.950> turn<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.430> can<00:02:49.580> just<00:02:49.700> spin<00:02:50.030> so

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
that kick turn and you can just spin so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.479 
that kick turn and you can just spin so
hopefully<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.350> get<00:02:51.440> some<00:02:51.500> some<00:02:52.250> little

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
hopefully we can get some some little

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.050 
hopefully we can get some some little
video<00:02:52.910> shots<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.510> today<00:02:53.690> also
