back of the car here and you can see how

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
back of the car here and you can see how
unique<00:02:22.290> looking<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.800> car<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.550> really

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
unique looking this car is and it really

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.970 
unique looking this car is and it really
does<00:02:24.000> shine<00:02:24.240> away<00:02:24.570> from<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.320> know<00:02:25.440> other<00:02:25.470> cars

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
does shine away from you know other cars

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.470 
does shine away from you know other cars
especially<00:02:26.190> considering<00:02:27.060> those<00:02:27.150> built<00:02:27.390> in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
especially considering those built in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.260 
especially considering those built in
the<00:02:27.540> 50s<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.520> covered<00:02:29.970> back

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the 50s so we do have the covered back

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.740 
the 50s so we do have the covered back
wheels<00:02:30.570> which<00:02:31.790> not<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.030> rare<00:02:33.240> back<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.600> those

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
wheels which not that rare back in those

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.300 
wheels which not that rare back in those
days<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.260> does<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.530> good<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> race<00:02:35.100> car

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
days but it does look good on a race car

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.100 
days but it does look good on a race car
to<00:02:35.460> have<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> super

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
to have it like that we have a super

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.010 
to have it like that we have a super
streamlined<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.920> low<00:02:38.160> low<00:02:38.550> body<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:39.870> our

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
streamlined and low low body we have our

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.250 
streamlined and low low body we have our

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
rider set off to one side and then we

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.410 
rider set off to one side and then we
have<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.220> know<00:02:44.340> side<00:02:44.670> mirrors<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.300> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
have you know side mirrors and one of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
have you know side mirrors and one of
them<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.959> left<00:02:46.140> side<00:02:46.350> mirror<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.770> in

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
them the left side mirror is actually in

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.290 
them the left side mirror is actually in
the<00:02:47.040> middle<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.370> car<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.120> driver

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the middle of the car so that the driver

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.560 
the middle of the car so that the driver
can<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.870> well<00:02:50.060> some<00:02:51.060> people<00:02:51.270> might<00:02:51.390> not

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
can see that well some people might not

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
can see that well some people might not
find<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.959> car<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.140> attractive<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.040> think

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
find the car very attractive I think

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.080 
find the car very attractive I think
it's<00:02:53.610> cool-looking<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.870> wouldn't<00:02:55.200> say<00:02:55.680> it's

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
it's cool-looking I wouldn't say it's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.090 
it's cool-looking I wouldn't say it's
amazing<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.050> definitely<00:02:58.290> unique<00:02:58.650> in

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
amazing but it's definitely unique in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.320 
amazing but it's definitely unique in
the<00:02:59.790> way<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:00.120> built<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.240> has

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
the way it was built and I think it has

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.720 
the way it was built and I think it has
a<00:03:03.390> little<00:03:03.660> bit<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.020> offer<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.770> know<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.490> so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
a little bit to offer you know more so

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.210 
a little bit to offer you know more so
maybe<00:03:05.850> than<00:03:06.120> other<00:03:06.300> cars<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.560> class<00:03:07.890> or

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
maybe than other cars in that class or

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.449 
maybe than other cars in that class or
in<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.580> pack<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> within<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.040> pack<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
in the pack so within the pack it

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.980 
in the pack so within the pack it
probably<00:03:11.730> falls<00:03:11.910> somewhere<00:03:12.180> within<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
probably falls somewhere within the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.080 
probably falls somewhere within the
middle<00:03:13.320> or<00:03:13.530> top<00:03:13.800> four<00:03:14.190> maybe<00:03:14.880> top<00:03:15.150> five<00:03:15.420> but

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
middle or top four maybe top five but

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.509 
middle or top four maybe top five but
probably<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.300> good<00:03:19.080> enough<00:03:19.380> car<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.130> buy<00:03:20.340> on

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
probably not a good enough car to buy on

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.270 
probably not a good enough car to buy on
like<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> standalone<00:03:21.239> type<00:03:21.630> basis<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.190> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
like a standalone type basis so in the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.470 
like a standalone type basis so in the
end<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.459> you're<00:03:23.580> looking<00:03:23.760> for<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.180> know<00:03:24.300> if
