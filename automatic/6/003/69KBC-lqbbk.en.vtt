00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 we have three big ones in the master class 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.579
 shooting a fashion shoot once I did 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 mostly as editorial like construction and 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.270
 partly also actual editorial 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.620
 make like this master class 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 we have a beauty at the masterclass 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.930
 shooting where we have a great models 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840
 have a great team make up artist and such 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.879
 continue and then you in the campaign 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.640
 direction we go have a shooting 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.929
 except patrick, that is called 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.940
 Personality and special things in 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.960
 Portraits and we have a complete 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 day photoshop 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 in it we have the concept of conception 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 we have 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 I look at the portfolios of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.659
 Participants I look at the end that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.600
 plan your new portfolio accordingly 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.929
 and also attack 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 we have a bit of business with us 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:07.960
 and different ones 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.090
 trifles and details and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.290
 Details of this are incredibly important 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.290
 for photography 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.720
 And thereby 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 I love the fashion and beauty photography 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.150
 because it's from the real world 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.370
 It's all part of the way and you feel that way 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.340
 can let off steam as for example 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.800
 in the z-building nice time by a hardware store 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.450
 go and have a few plates together 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.110
 then nail one correctly at the end 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 to have horny or just with the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 stylists working out great fashion 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.160
 with really great make up artists 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.210
 work and of course right 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.380
 to pick out nice and great models 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.270
 and if you have everything together in the end 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.550
 then you have very good cards to correct 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.250
 to achieve good results and that can 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.180
 then you just synonymous with photoshop 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.670
 Edit and everyone knows if you can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.489
 really good raw material then did 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.120
 It is also really fun there time to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.239
 Use the pictures last cut to 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.239
 give 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680
 seaworthy 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:45.459
 people there possible with me it is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.459
 is meaningless pakistan 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 I
