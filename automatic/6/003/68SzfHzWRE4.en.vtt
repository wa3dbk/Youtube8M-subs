four vehicles that I'm interested in and
I'm<00:00:27.360> mainly<00:00:27.660> interested<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.410> dual<00:00:28.619> cap

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.710

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
to be a tough time getting to change

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.280 
to be a tough time getting to change
through<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> gears<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.390> using<00:00:47.960> four<00:00:48.140> wheel

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
through the gears and using four wheel

through the gears and using four wheel
drive<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.250> probably<00:00:50.030> taking<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.450> bit<00:00:50.570> of

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
drive and probably taking a bit of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.020 
drive and probably taking a bit of

buggy at the bottom so you want to get
through<00:02:13.090> here<00:02:13.120> quite<00:02:13.480> slightly<00:02:13.870> because<00:02:13.959> you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
through here quite slightly because you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.120 
through here quite slightly because you
don't<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.319> rip<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> back<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.980> vehicle

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
don't have rip the back of the vehicle

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.330 
don't have rip the back of the vehicle
off<00:02:15.370> soon<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.450> back<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.780> cleared<00:02:17.250> give<00:02:18.250> it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
off soon as the back is cleared give it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
off soon as the back is cleared give it
the<00:02:18.400> mumbos<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.030> get<00:02:19.299> out<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:19.600> or<00:02:20.049> this<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the mumbos and get out there or this is

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.180 
the mumbos and get out there or this is
going<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.620> probably<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.069> most

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
going to be the probably the most

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.770 
going to be the probably the most
challenging<00:02:22.120> vehicle<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> get<00:02:22.540> through<00:02:22.750> just

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
challenging vehicle to get through just

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.570 
challenging vehicle to get through just
because<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.410> very<00:02:23.440> technical<00:02:23.799> drive<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
because it's a very technical drive and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.800 
because it's a very technical drive and
with<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> overhangs<00:02:25.209> mate<00:02:25.450> you've<00:02:25.599> got<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> be

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
with the overhangs mate you've got to be

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.050 
with the overhangs mate you've got to be
really<00:02:26.019> careful<00:02:26.230> real<00:02:26.650> placement<00:02:27.130> yeah<00:02:27.760> Sean

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
really careful real placement yeah Sean

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.630 
really careful real placement yeah Sean
got<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.480> what<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:29.130> pick<00:02:30.130> out<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.489> but

please put on the brake another 200 a
bit<00:02:55.010> stuck<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.180> bottomed<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
bit stuck it's just bottomed out the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
bit stuck it's just bottomed out the
bottom<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.140> hill<00:02:57.410> which<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:59.120> typical

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
bottom of hill which is pretty typical

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.729 
bottom of hill which is pretty typical
because<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.900> overhangs<00:03:00.319> on<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> vehicle

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
because the overhangs on the vehicle

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.370 
because the overhangs on the vehicle
we're<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:01.760> sticking<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.209> get<00:03:03.049> some<00:03:03.200> free

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
we're just sticking it out get some free

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.960 
we're just sticking it out get some free
room<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.709> hopefully<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.760> drive<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.180> a

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
room and hopefully we can drive it out a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.789 
room and hopefully we can drive it out a
little<00:03:07.970> bit<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.239> more<00:03:08.510> influence<00:03:09.080> for<00:03:09.620> else

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
little bit of more influence for else

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.339 
little bit of more influence for else
more<00:03:10.099> revs<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.180> more<00:03:11.330> refs<00:03:11.510> Morris<00:03:11.900> Morris

more revs as it more refs Morris Morris
Morris<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:13.790> its<00:03:13.970> backup<00:03:14.329> security

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
Morris that's its backup security

Morris that's its backup security
there's<00:03:16.340> always<00:03:16.489> going<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.640> be<00:03:16.700> nice

there's always going to be nice
challenging<00:03:17.269> chemistry<00:03:17.599> of<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.720> last

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
challenging chemistry of the last

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
vehicle and then with the overhangs it's

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.880 
vehicle and then with the overhangs it's
more<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.269> challenge<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.840> once<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:21.709> out
