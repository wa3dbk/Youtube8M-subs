00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 yes some love and welcome 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.410
 to a small leaking head today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.540
 a small taymor special 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.099
 because we want to make pizza muffins 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 pizza muffins I've thought 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.080
 because yes, they are relatively rarely relative 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.090
 Rarely was it relatively easy to hold on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.609
 just do all the ingredients 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.519
 I can work together right up 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 teaches every gamer that so small 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.890
 snack in between yes what I up 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.840
 every case of two so complete me only 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.279
 egg yolk or protein only two complete 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.079
 line 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:39.829
 then you need two teaspoons 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:44.149
 baking powder 100 grams of corn semolina 70 grams 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.100
 two tablespoons of sunflower oil 80 mm 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.980
 buttermilk a bit of yes paprika 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 Salami and cheese you can stop 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.309
 think for yourself that he will go in there 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 you want you can only salami or ham 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.059
 make or tomatoes poland with tomato 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.390
 I'm not careful anymore 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.579
 this is supposed to be a bit 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 Jigsaw did not even look yes and then 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 a little salt and pepper to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.210
 spice up the whole then would strengthen 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.750
 have to go back the whole thing together 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.420
 tinkering so already ready 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.060
 they definitely still needs so 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.850
 a muffin baking dish or such muffin 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 ramekins depending on what the hold women 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.420
 has relatively no matter where the only one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 power and yes baking time is about 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.939
 15 to 20 minutes would have to stop 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.610
 depending on which places on top of it comes to me 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.030
 let now mostly air only at 160 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 Degree 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.490
 about 15 to 20 minutes in there as 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.980
 First of all tunisians the whole powder 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:52.750
 callgirls mail 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:54.430
 the most pure thing could be now 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.020
 sometimes easy forward I will now 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.570
 probably only fades 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.100
 and do that one hears me already 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.400
 similar if that works here now 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.400
 have to 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.489
 so euro measure is ready the mass is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.980
 I'll say something happy, though 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.590
 that is no problem the muffin dough 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.330
 is always for politics on the edge sticks 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.820
 also a bit of the Mexican 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.489
 bad next you just stop euro 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.930
 make you stop in because I'm in 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.220
 the case of mixa paprika cheese and salami 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.140
 just ready and where that will come from 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.299
 spoon whisk or something 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.519
 Another stop should be the time 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.519
 is beautifully blended 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.580
 it smells really horny better 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.770
 switch over so then you can 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.330
 make easy from the heart 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.400
 I 'm now fifth 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.140
 just made greasing 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.210
 I hope keeps a relatively good 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.310
 baking mold I do not have to be great 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.530
 somehow with paper and so on 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.530
 and then just going on in here 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.920
 first only a bit you have to 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.210

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.550
 further and in the video description 1 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.300
 Of course you can always link to it 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.489
 after how you have your muffins time 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.489
 want more or less 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.520
 the more one I leave free now 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.250
 No patrick I know 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.390

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.390
 away and stylish here is still on 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.580
 the whole comes after 20 minutes 15 to 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.140
 20 minutes in the oven would just like 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.660
 said look like it then with you so 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.920
 yes the pizza mafia bugatti costs that 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 he also does not taste like muffins or 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.960
 revisor pizza rolls so like so 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.240
 you would just stop the dough and eat 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.730
 for a bit of toppings without sauce tastes 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.310
 but super cool and anja is just one 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.720
 bit flat but i think so 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.190
 that he not only comes with the problem 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.040

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.000
