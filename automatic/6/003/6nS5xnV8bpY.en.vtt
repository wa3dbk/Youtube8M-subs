00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
to like a angel custom but I wasn't that

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.750 
to like a angel custom but I wasn't that
great<00:04:50.000> at<00:04:50.360> sculpting<00:04:50.720> at<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.200> time<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.770> get

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
great at sculpting at the time so I get

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.840 
great at sculpting at the time so I get
the<00:04:52.880> chance<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.390> I<00:04:53.919> know<00:04:54.919> some<00:04:55.400> people<00:04:55.700> might

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
the chance to I know some people might

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.580 
the chance to I know some people might
be<00:04:55.880> thinking<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.479> copied<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.020> name<00:04:57.200> sage

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
be thinking I copied the name sage

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.190 
be thinking I copied the name sage

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
because ginger is also spice but

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200 
because ginger is also spice but
