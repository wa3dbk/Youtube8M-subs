and pretty much the only other thing I
want<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.500> cover<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.099> design<00:02:12.790> when<00:02:13.390> I

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
want to cover is the design when I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.819 
want to cover is the design when I
picked<00:02:13.689> this<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.170> actually<00:02:14.319> thought<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.709> was

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
picked this up I actually thought it was

picked this up I actually thought it was
aluminum<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.510> guess<00:02:17.439> they<00:02:17.650> fooled<00:02:17.920> me<00:02:18.040> it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
aluminum I guess they fooled me it's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.270 
aluminum I guess they fooled me it's
grey<00:02:19.689> plastic<00:02:19.989> which<00:02:20.439> I<00:02:20.590> totally<00:02:20.829> don't<00:02:21.189> mind

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
grey plastic which I totally don't mind

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.080 
grey plastic which I totally don't mind
it<00:02:21.609> looks<00:02:21.640> perfect<00:02:22.299> next<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.719> my<00:02:22.870> iMac<00:02:24.090> it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
it looks perfect next to my iMac it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.089 
it looks perfect next to my iMac it
probably<00:02:25.510> looks<00:02:25.689> perfect<00:02:26.349> next<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.709> any<00:02:26.859> other

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
probably looks perfect next to any other

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.390 
probably looks perfect next to any other
