00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.929
 and then the manolo on youtube is another video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 here for you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 another video channel and today staff 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
 more a personal video game and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 It will always be a little different until 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 because it even shorter because in that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 video or just talking there is about the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.439
 great news that is to come from the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.700
 round 8 and my honest opinion does not 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 I have my opinion is worth something. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.559
 but everton is the cost of the opinion 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 maybe you have the same opinion as 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.420
 I think it's time, you give it to her. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 opinion about something or even that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.020
 also if the person has an opinion 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.879
 different then she can comment then why 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.489
 I think this is a great tool 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 of all the comments so if you have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 ps suggestions should be interesting you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 also comment that someone from the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.800
 cef falls on my video and ends up seeing 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 suggestion you commented on in the video 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.290
 so my tip is neither suggestions 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 Our coconut is bound when 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.020
 You're talking too fast, it's all over. 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.420
 giving you that breath because you have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 The face that just happened, but how? 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 was saying of our law that it ended 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 with the weather of the video but now I'm going 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.490
 to like it the same way because here is the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 khan humility 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.900
 we're making no sense anymore 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 as I was saying then 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.860
 give suggestions to comment on stefy 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 videos that will let them see their 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 suggestions goes that she will go to the game right 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.560
 so this is very interesting one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 very cool mechanic who from youtube 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 also from the name of the game they watch the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.759
 suggestion tickets then go medical 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 Not even the big news here. 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.869
 The first one I'm going to show in the video is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.549
 change or whether they intend to place 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.070
 here for example you have two elements 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.070
 in the case that you take chinin and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 The other you pick up from Junin there you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.210
 you can create combinations with these two 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.850
 elements in the case of the river also vie 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.469
 the fluff as it is in the eminem itself 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 together to the water and future 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.810
 you will create the river tom and so on 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.179
 the captain yamato if he did not 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830
 I'm wrong, it 's sue hiddleston tone that he 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.450
 join in that fund 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.470
 the two elements and ends up creating a 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.000
 little tone 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 It's very very cool, same people. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.770
 end up creating a great variety in the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.660
 game will not have people just with the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.090
 same element so knows for example 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.920
 two people who have hayton hecatomb 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 for example will have people who have and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 another will have people who will have a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.750
 little tone 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.320
 or the person is born a great addition 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.510
 I really like this game. 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.130
 novelty hope it really puts 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.420
 This in the game is going to be really cool. 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.270
 same 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.250
 We are here for the new news that 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.520
 if ever for new characters by 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.380
 where 800 and a lot of faith and the galera like it 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600
 the photos of the characters I like to see 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.760
 the variety of characters then there 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.590
 This is very cool news and the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.930
 staff is going to be named ruy 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.260
 in the case of Antena1 swordsman of snows 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.090
 imagine a tie pin on the cachambi in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.870
 buffon gaucho knot 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 they usually create and hose and suzuki is just 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.160
 a complicated name even because I 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.090
 I'm talking fast, by hell. Monday. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.220
 until I smoked crack but not the staff 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.800
 of this unanism cag santo daime raica 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.519
 glamor that's really cool the short homo 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.830
 Hetero has a few photos until 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.430
 nowadays the Chinese football in the south 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.780
 very cool very Burani this is it right 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.970
 bush will also condition bonds nor 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.519
 there pro game hope they put 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.890
 new achievements for the game is and there 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.470
 who did not receive and do not think 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.840
 nobody received the title and the event of the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.360
 children's day will soon receive the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.150
 Our playful title 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.070
 Since he's traveling to Marota then here 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.730
 in the last news that I have province 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.090
 of today 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.000
 in case the new modes set this right 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.739
 annual staff of 8 will have is another two 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.049
 types of motorcycles in me and in the case of 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.769
 help from frogs that you already know right 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.560
 and already has 97 100 of the snakes that in the case 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.420
 of the mandate showing there the cable as it 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.489
 becomes the second of the snakes then this 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.970
 will be deployed in the game personally 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.979
 This is going to be you 're going to have to have the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.810
 invocation obviously charges with less 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.330
 votes on me and hopefully this really 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.440
 works in the game and ends up leaving him 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.420
 more dynamic, right? 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.580
 Finally we have the ocean there 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.630
 the laws in their case would be 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 added 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.530
 I also saw great news is that in the 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.560
 if they were players who are neither 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.990
 together they can also use 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.460
 elementary techniques and I have a 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.140
 uncertain opinion 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.790
 when I knew that, when I saw 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.260
 here in the news itself is that in the case 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.750
 It was the first one I showed you. 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.520
 I think it's kind of bizarre. 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.380
 ethical is strange 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.290
 You know, for example, you see someone like 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.110
 rock that is focusing on the yew is there it is 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.450
 manipulated some element but not if you 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.890
 to repair the characters in the anime 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.080
 are very balanced 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.480
 this is a bit of cheese has a little 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.520
 of me together and have even the father 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.930
 together, in which case you are obliged 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.630
 always have to give a blow of your 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.740
 enemy by handling a sword that ends 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.370
 also working a bit of everything 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.070
 together 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:25.200
 so you see that a guy who is very 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.480
 judgment has attached power there are also 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.760
 elementary techniques ends up being a 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.050
 bizarre but it also creates a good 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.820
 variety in the game 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.640
 in case you will see a lot of people 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.620
 set using elements which is very 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.450
 Interestingly, I would love to 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.970
 know your opinion guys 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.550
 even because I think a very 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.740
 interesting and very different. 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.750
 people who did not like it had a lot of people 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.590
 What do you like so little? 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.440
 Divided 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.750
 So you think it's personal there 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.730
 you found is such big news 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 of the team was pushing today too 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.430
 where 8 is going to be a long time because I 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.260
 I think number 8 is the lucky number 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.720
 then comment on their opinions and there 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.160
 your expectations with 11 8 is then it is 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.290
 This, I hope you guys have 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.950
 liked the video did not sign up for the 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.200
 channel 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.510
 If you liked the video click I liked it but 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.920
 are the favorites that help a lot in 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.700
 disclosure and do not forget to comment 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.040

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.680
 is to be added in round 8 comment 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.210
