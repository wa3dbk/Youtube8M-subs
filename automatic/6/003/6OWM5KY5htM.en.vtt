00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you don't really use heroic strike since

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.929

if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.630> actually<00:01:22.020> choose<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.799> create<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
if you can actually choose to create a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429
