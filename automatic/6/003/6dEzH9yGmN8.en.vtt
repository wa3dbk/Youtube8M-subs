00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.880
 new video as you saw it in the title 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.500
 mod broomstick large FAUTO 5 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello in ok was something I wanted 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 teach them today since this does not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 I know since it comes to my channel 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 friend carlos collacce of whose with him 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 I will leave them in the description since 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 he passed me this video I stayed 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 amazed because I do not know the truth I felt 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.800
 pretty pretty to see this mode since 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 it does not look pretty fun as they see it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.260
 It is practically a totally broom 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 flying yes as if it were a witch 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 It's group lime, I do not know, it's something 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 funny, not how they can be 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 observing the truth I have something left 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 amazed and I said is that fuck is this 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 can be done in the console I do not 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 I want to imagine what is going to be done 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 when the grand theft auto game 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 5 already leave in what is doing the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.899
 computer not the truth is something that I the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 I really hope enough and more than anything 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.739
 more than the gameplay or any of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 these things what I prefer and more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 I want it to come out in what it is doing 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.850
 the computer console is to come out 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.320
 the mods ok because if you guys know 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 modify in console is possible but it is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.890
 something difficult but if we modify in what 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.460
 what is the computer doing? 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.900
 very easy we can not give 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
 in what the game of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.590
 minecraft how many mods do you have in what 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.299
 is becoming a computer and how many have 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.070
 of console no and besides that is a lot 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.780
 easier and the truth that they enjoy 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.369
 much more, I do not remember many 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900
 molds that had made this mod if not 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.090
 I was wrong was in what was 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.220
 the great cars san andreas and 11 with 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.350
 which I had a great time 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.000
 this and the goku that you could make camÃ­ 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.530
 You were the best of you 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.860

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.930
 Tell me what your motorcycles were 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.759
 favorites and well that just read it 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.890
 in the comments is not also that I 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.929
 loved it was the one of spider man and iron man 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.570
 of grand theft auto 4 and I want to go back to 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.280
 relive that image hopefully it's something easy 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 to install the mods because I was 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.850
 reading that there was going to be something like a 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 little bit of impediment but not the same 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.750
 how they see it the way it has 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.160
 delighted is that they can see the speed 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.810
 to which he goes in fact can even notice 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.520
 that the catcher more than anything in the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.770
 games in which to a little since the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 rendering textures as they take a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 little in loading not since the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.929
 vehicle goes at a speed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.490
 excessively fast indeed if I do not 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.679
 could be wrong faster than the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.540
 jet house is something that is super cool 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.280
 not here as my friends see it from 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.540
 what he is doing to chute and then 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.579
 practically here already 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.110
