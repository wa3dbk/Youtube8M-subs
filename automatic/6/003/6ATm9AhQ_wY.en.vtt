bracket off take the wires off there's a
new<00:01:14.340> battery<00:01:16.670> we're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> start<00:01:18.240> right

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
new battery we're going to start right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
new battery we're going to start right
back<00:01:18.840> inside<00:01:21.080> off<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> these

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
back inside off if you have one of these

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.730 
back inside off if you have one of these
on<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.580> because<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> won't<00:01:24.720> fit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.160 

the<00:01:29.740> handle<00:01:30.100> would<00:01:30.520> fit<00:01:33.690> battery<00:01:34.690> clean<00:01:35.020> out

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
the handle would fit battery clean out

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.870 
the handle would fit battery clean out
your<00:01:35.320> battery<00:01:35.500> case<00:01:35.980> like<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.490> did<00:01:38.100> put<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.250> in

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
your battery case like I did put this in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.180 
your battery case like I did put this in
here<00:01:40.210> like<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:43.170> make<00:01:44.170> sure<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.560> terminals<00:01:44.770> are

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
here like so make sure the terminals are

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.540 
here like so make sure the terminals are
in<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.400> right<00:01:45.550> spot<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.220> positive<00:01:50.550> then

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
in the right spot the positive then

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.030 
in the right spot the positive then
reassemble<00:01:52.150> everything<00:01:52.270> back<00:01:52.810> always<00:01:53.710> start

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
reassemble everything back always start

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:03.690 
reassemble everything back always start
bolts<00:01:54.460> by<00:01:54.670> hand

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.999 

so<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.820> don't<00:02:04.909> strip<00:02:05.329> it<00:02:05.360> because<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.869> is<00:02:05.990> led

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:20.650 

which<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.399> quite<00:02:10.759> tricky

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.720
