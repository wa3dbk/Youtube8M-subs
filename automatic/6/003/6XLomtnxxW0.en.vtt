 I come to present a video 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.740
 collaborative with flavor party the card 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.110
 congratulates that if beauty is all 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.419
 Excited recipe I hope you told him 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.040
 in the information house and leave 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.880
 the data that each of the videos from 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.960
 that collaborative on May 10 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.330
 we will need powder to prepare 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.570
 flavored gelatin flavor of your 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.880
 preference 4 envelopes of grenetine of 7 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.330
 grams each 1 can of milk 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.940
 evaporated a can of condensed milk 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.070
 an 8 ounce philadelphia cheese a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.530
 regular milk cup and 1 cup of water 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.650
 well the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.450
 prepare the gelatins as they say 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.850
 the instructions the only thing I do 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.739
 It is to add a little less water as 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.490
 half a cup less so there's a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.410
 a little firmer 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.550
 the water cup we are going to add the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.550
 four envelopes of grenetina 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.970
 and we are going to reserve them for a moment 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 well here we have the jellies 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.400
 are already curdled and now what 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.010
 we are going to do is cut them into small 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 cubes and go placing them in a mold 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.670
 refractory in which we are going to prepare 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.650
 our gelatin 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.130
 well here we have gelatin minced 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.630
 and here I am already preparing the mold for 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 this place a little oil in a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.090
 paper napkin and the only thing I'm going to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.090
 blow up the mold with the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 Napkin to dismantle more 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.210
 easily 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.070
 I will reserve it for the moment in the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.149
 blender let's add the cheese 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.149
 the milk cup 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.140
 condensed milk 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.480
 and evaporated milk 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.840
 before liquefying the mixture that we have in 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 the blender we are going to place our 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.380
 grenetina to bain-marie to be done 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.340
 liquid or in the microwave oven 20 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:43.110
 seconds and while we liquefy let's go 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.970
 adding little greens 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.080
 and we already have it liquid and we are going to go 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.070
 adding the little bit while 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.070
 we apply the same 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.260
 we already have the right mixture the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.370
 chopped gelatin and the name prepared and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.760
 let's go accommodating 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.239
 the jelly cubes like us 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.239
 we like it 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.800
 once we're settled as more 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.430
 we liked what we are going to do is 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.430
 add the mixture 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 we already have minced 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.500
 and now we are going to lead to that set 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.670
 for about about 2 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.050
 or three hours or until it is firm 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.050
 to disassemble it 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.830
 well once it coagulated they went through 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.390
 approximately two and a half hours what 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.390
 we are going to do is unmold the 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.810
 this is the result once 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.970
 we unmold to decorate just put a few 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.459
 squares of the same cope gelatin for 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.440
 do the mosaic as you see is very easy 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.030
 to do and well I also did some 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.400
 Individuals that were left of this 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.320
