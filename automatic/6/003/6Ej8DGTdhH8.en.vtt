00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:17.119

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.050
 pedagogues

 how to do it away and meet 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:38.020
 We have to take this fun 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:41.140
 on it and that should also be and then 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.159
 here on loud picture and I want here 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.159
 this picture 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.770
 everything was over now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.159
 O 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.159
 Not 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 but 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:17.450
 hello has made only once can you 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:23.930
 still adjust transparency until 11 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.750
 so far but now finally operate 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.680
 how can you do that now? 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.379
 but also I believe something too much 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.480
 sometimes better to 2 550 again 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.800
 you also partly whether it makes them me 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.730
 do not know exactly what that is 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.730
 because see 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:53.880
 logically or even on 255 everyone is that 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 that on 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.110
 on 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.640
 there 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.540
 that fits 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.540
 then see that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.080
 actually looks pretty good 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 a bit of sport 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.170
 looks a bit 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.170
 very good 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.129
 yes choose exactly if that's why 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.060
 some missing peter should I sometimes 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:40.469
 So they are very good because of me 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.319
 Also, I think we are extreme 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.450
 important so yes it is up to you 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.730
 and yes then I would enjoy it 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.510
 Try and yes that was it 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.510
 then until the next
