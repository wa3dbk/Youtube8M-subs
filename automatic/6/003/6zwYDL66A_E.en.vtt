the<00:00:44.969> pot<00:00:45.149> over<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> fire<00:00:45.989> until<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.530> comes<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the pot over the fire until it comes to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
the pot over the fire until it comes to
a<00:00:47.070> boil<00:00:47.370> while<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.149> waiting<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.600> to

a boil while you're waiting for that to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.150 
a boil while you're waiting for that to
happen<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.440> start<00:00:52.680> prepping<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.129> food

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
happen you can start prepping the food

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
happen you can start prepping the food
so<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.030> three<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> four<00:00:54.629> pounds<00:00:54.870> of

small red potatoes so I've been told
that<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> reason<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> take<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that the reason that you take off just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.069 
that the reason that you take off just
like<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.640> quarter<00:01:00.090> size<00:01:00.449> piece<00:01:00.809> from<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like a quarter size piece from the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.039 
like a quarter size piece from the
potato<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.789> salt<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.539> enter<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
potato is so that the salt can enter in

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
potato is so that the salt can enter in
and<00:01:04.290> give<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> flavor<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and give it all the flavor and then you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810 
and give it all the flavor and then you
want<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.270> eight<00:01:06.689> years<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.170> corn<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.890> then

want about eight years of corn and then

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
want about eight years of corn and then

four pounds of fish we like whitefish
you're<00:01:13.740> ever<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.040> Michigan<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:15.090> whitefish

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you're ever in Michigan get whitefish

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
you're ever in Michigan get whitefish
once<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.530> comes<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> boil<00:01:17.520> put<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
once the water comes up to a boil put a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
once the water comes up to a boil put a
bunch<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> salt<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.710> put<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bunch of salt in it then put in the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
bunch of salt in it then put in the
potatoes<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.450> 10<00:01:21.869> minutes<00:01:22.080> later<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.950> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
potatoes about 10 minutes later put in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.910 
potatoes about 10 minutes later put in
the<00:01:23.159> corn<00:01:23.430> followed<00:01:24.030> shortly<00:01:24.299> thereafter<00:01:24.509> by

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the corn followed shortly thereafter by

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.450 
the corn followed shortly thereafter by
adding<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> fish<00:01:27.140> fish<00:01:28.140> boil<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
adding the fish fish boil so the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.100 
adding the fish fish boil so the
potatoes<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> total<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> 20

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
potatoes are in for a total of 20

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
potatoes are in for a total of 20
minutes<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> corn<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> total<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.759> 10

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
minutes the corn is in for a total of 10

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
minutes the corn is in for a total of 10
minutes<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.869> fish<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> total

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
minutes and the fish is in for a total

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.399 
minutes and the fish is in for a total
of<00:01:35.220> eight<00:01:35.490> minutes<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.869> last<00:01:36.960> step

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of eight minutes then the very last step

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
of eight minutes then the very last step
this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> fun<00:01:38.369> part<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> boil<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this is the fun part the boil over and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
this is the fun part the boil over and
back<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> idea<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> fish<00:01:41.430> oils

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
back so the idea is all the fish oils

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
back so the idea is all the fish oils
and<00:01:42.000> stuff<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.329> might<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> eat

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and stuff you might not want to eat

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
and stuff you might not want to eat
floats<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> top<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> water<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.939> if

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
floats to the top of the water and if

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
floats to the top of the water and if
you<00:01:45.420> throw<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> bunch<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.079> diesel<00:01:46.530> fuel<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
