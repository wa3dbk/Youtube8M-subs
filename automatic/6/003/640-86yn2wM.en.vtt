00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:01.833
 Let's figure out some examples 

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:05.001
 with exercises for writing expressions with variables. 

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.286
 We are told: "Write an expression, 

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.703
 to present with 11 more than a. " 

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.955
 You can only have a, 

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.790
 but if you're looking for 11 more than a, 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.623
 you will want to add 11, 

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.054
 so you can write it as a plus 11. 

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.406
 You can also write this as 11 plus a. 

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.041
 Both will have 11 more than a. 

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.697
 Let's check our answer here. 

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:28.716
 It is true. 

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.537
 Let's solve some of these tasks. 

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.845
 "Write an expression to represent the sum 

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:33.845
 of d and 9. " 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.569
 The sum of d and 9 - 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.623
 this means that you will collect d and 9. 

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.345
 So I can write it as d plus 9, 

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.178
 or I can write it like 9 plus d. 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.900
 Check our answer. 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.161
 It is true. 

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.705
 Let's decide a few more. 

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.691
 "Write an expression to represent j minus 15." 

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.574
 I can just write it with mathematical symbols, 

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:59.420
 instead of writing the word minus, 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.227
 instead of writing m-and-n-y-c, 

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.310
 I can write j - 15. 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.858
 And then I check my answer. 

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.898
 It is true. 

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.839
 Let's solve a few more of these. 

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.018
 Very funny. 

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:14.768
 "Write an expression to represent 7 in the" 

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.721
 There are several ways I can do it. 

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.269
 I can use this little point here, 

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.186
 to write 7 in r this way. 

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:22.674
 That will be true. 

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:24.469
 I can literally just write 7r. 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.060
 If I write just 7r, it also happens. 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.399
 Let me check my answer. 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.117
 It is true. 

00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:32.611
 Let me decide a few more of these tasks, 

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.438
 to see that I could 

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:38.038
 to write just 10, this is not a decimal point, 

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:40.291
 it is slightly higher than the decimal point. 

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.487
 This is multiplication when you start 

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:44.840
 you start using the algebra, you use this symbol 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.403
 instead of the usual multiplication cross, "x", 

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:51.061
 because it is confused with the letter "x", 

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.064
 which we use to denote a variable. 

00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:54.694
 That's why this special point is very useful. 

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.111
 We want to write 10 in u, 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.904
 10 u, check our answer. 

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:00.978
 It is true. 

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.966
 Let's solve one more. 

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:07.455
 "Write an expression to represent 8 divided by d." 

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:10.206
 We can write it as 8 and then one line 

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:13.039
 here is 8 divided by d. 

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:15.732
 And we're ready. 

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:17.510
 This is 8 divided by d. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.081
 Let me check the answer. 

00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.637
 I will solve one more of these tasks. 

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.341
 Oh, this is 6 divided by b. 

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:24.470
 The same thing. 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.867
 6, I can use this tool here. 

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:27.995
 He does the same thing, 

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.078
 as if I had pressed the line. 

00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:32.157
 Here it is - 6 divided by b. 

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:33.364
 I check the answer. 

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:34.697
 It is true.
