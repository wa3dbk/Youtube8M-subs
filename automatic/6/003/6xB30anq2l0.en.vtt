compound up here you have to put the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.169 
compound up here you have to put the
paste<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.890> on<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.130> particular<00:01:48.340> model<00:01:48.969> that

pretty easy to do so I'm gonna put this
side<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.470> here<00:02:24.530> cuz<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.310> gonna<00:02:25.400> plug

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
side right here cuz this is gonna plug

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.020 
side right here cuz this is gonna plug
into<00:02:25.940> your<00:02:26.330> fan<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.800> let's<00:02:28.340> go<00:02:28.550> ahead<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.940> get

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
into your fan so let's go ahead and get

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.070 
into your fan so let's go ahead and get
this<00:02:29.180> thing<00:02:29.240> into<00:02:29.780> place<00:02:34.540> after<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.780> went<00:02:35.990> ahead

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
this thing into place after I went ahead

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.870 
this thing into place after I went ahead
and<00:02:36.230> tested<00:02:36.470> putting<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> core<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.640> there<00:02:37.850> I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
and tested putting the core on there I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.850 
and tested putting the core on there I
noticed<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.690> pre<00:02:38.990> installed<00:02:39.140> thermal

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
noticed that the pre installed thermal

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.590 
noticed that the pre installed thermal
compound<00:02:40.040> didn't<00:02:40.760> go<00:02:41.060> around<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.420> outer

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
compound didn't go around the outer

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.020 
compound didn't go around the outer
edges<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.680> went<00:02:42.890> ahead<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.280> added<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.880> little

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
edges so I went ahead and added a little

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.630 
edges so I went ahead and added a little
bit<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.330> extra<00:02:44.600> thermal<00:02:45.140> compound<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:46.370> to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
bit of extra thermal compound just to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.570 
bit of extra thermal compound just to
add<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.990> since<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.800> know<00:02:48.890> those<00:02:49.130> things<00:02:49.340> do

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
add to it since you know those things do

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.020 
add to it since you know those things do
get<00:02:49.790> hot<00:02:50.120> therefore<00:02:50.690> gigahertz<00:02:51.020> at<00:02:51.590> 8<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.400> make

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
get hot therefore gigahertz at 8 so make

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.950 
get hot therefore gigahertz at 8 so make
sure<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.270> add<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.450> little<00:02:53.690> bit<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.840> thermal

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
sure you add a little bit of thermal

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.180 
sure you add a little bit of thermal
compound<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.770> there<00:02:54.920> thermal<00:02:55.310> paste<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:57.190> so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
compound in there thermal paste and so

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.920 
compound in there thermal paste and so
we're<00:02:58.430> gonna<00:02:58.520> go<00:02:58.700> ahead<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.880> add<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.450> cooler

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
we're gonna go ahead and add the cooler

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.310 
we're gonna go ahead and add the cooler
on

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
on

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.500 
on
all<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.890> CPU<00:03:01.340> goes<00:03:01.580> on<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:02.090> now<00:03:02.480> I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
all right the CPU goes on there now I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.450 
all right the CPU goes on there now I
put<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.140> back<00:03:03.290> section<00:03:03.590> first<00:03:04.040> and

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
put it on the back section first and

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.310 
put it on the back section first and
then<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.820> came<00:03:04.940> back<00:03:05.120> through<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.870> clip<00:03:06.080> on

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
then I came back through to the clip on

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.090 
then I came back through to the clip on
the<00:03:06.380> front<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:07.430> as<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.840> can<00:03:09.050> see<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.770> there

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
the front so as you can see right there

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.030 
the front so as you can see right there
and<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:11.750> mean<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.050> got<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.320> push<00:03:12.500> down<00:03:12.770> on<00:03:12.800> it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and I mean you got to push down on it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.530 
and I mean you got to push down on it
pretty<00:03:13.310> good<00:03:13.550> make<00:03:13.760> sure<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.330> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
pretty good make sure it's in there and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.330 
pretty good make sure it's in there and
then<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.750> clip<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.110> into<00:03:15.260> place<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.100> you

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
then you clip it into place so as you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390 
then you clip it into place so as you
see<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.730> clips<00:03:16.970> right<00:03:17.209> here<00:03:18.340> alright<00:03:19.340> now

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
see the clips right here alright now

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.370 
see the clips right here alright now
that<00:03:19.610> that's<00:03:19.910> installed<00:03:20.450> make<00:03:20.930> sure<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.200> push

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
that that's installed make sure you push

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.050 
that that's installed make sure you push
this<00:03:21.560> all<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.860> way<00:03:21.950> down<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.520> she's<00:03:22.760> locked

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this all the way down so she's locked

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.170 
this all the way down so she's locked
next<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> fan<00:03:24.880> right<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
next is you have the fan right here and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.580 
next is you have the fan right here and
see<00:03:26.330> what<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.600> got<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.870> groove<00:03:27.140> right<00:03:27.320> here

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
see what it's got the groove right here

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.560 
see what it's got the groove right here
so<00:03:28.280> you're<00:03:28.430> gonna<00:03:28.520> come<00:03:28.790> back<00:03:28.970> around<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
so you're gonna come back around on the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.949 
so you're gonna come back around on the
other<00:03:29.720> side<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.440> says<00:03:30.650> CPU<00:03:31.190> fan<00:03:31.430> cooler<00:03:32.150> so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
other side and it says CPU fan cooler so

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.449 
other side and it says CPU fan cooler so
you<00:03:33.050> pretty<00:03:33.260> much<00:03:33.320> just<00:03:33.470> plug<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.070> right<00:03:34.100> in<00:03:34.370> to

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
you pretty much just plug it right in to

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.550 
you pretty much just plug it right in to
where<00:03:34.580> she<00:03:34.760> goes<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:35.420> done<00:03:35.720> deal<00:03:35.989> now

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
where she goes and that's done deal now

where she goes and that's done deal now
you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.890> take<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.190> zip<00:03:38.000> tie<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.959> bring<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.320> back

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
you can take a zip tie and bring it back

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.229 
you can take a zip tie and bring it back
out<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.769> way<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.090> back<00:03:41.209> side

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
out of the way this is on the back side

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.110 
out of the way this is on the back side
the<00:03:41.630> cooler<00:03:41.840> master<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.500> where<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.830> have

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the cooler master is where you have

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560 
the cooler master is where you have
space<00:03:44.120> for<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:45.670> extra<00:03:46.670> fans<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.269> want<00:03:47.450> to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
space for the extra fans if you want to

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.540 
space for the extra fans if you want to
do<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.440> we're<00:03:48.620> gonna<00:03:48.709> actually<00:03:49.010> check<00:03:49.430> it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
do it so we're gonna actually check it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.090 
do it so we're gonna actually check it
out<00:03:49.670> once<00:03:49.910> we<00:03:50.030> get<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.269> fired<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.950> what

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
out once we get it fired up and see what

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.040 
out once we get it fired up and see what
type<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.370> temperatures<00:03:52.850> were<00:03:53.000> running<00:03:53.330> at<00:03:53.480> but

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050
