 audi revolutionized the industry 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.319
 automotive or create a traction system 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 on the four wheels for the street cars the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.519
 audi quattro used this new technology 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.179
 to dominate the speed rallies of the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.370
 group b 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.190

 in 1983 and five in 1984 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 however, the lack of restrictions and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.610
 very high power led to the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
 closure of group b while others 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 companies were working to develop their 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.309
 their own various traction systems 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 fatal accidents 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.850
