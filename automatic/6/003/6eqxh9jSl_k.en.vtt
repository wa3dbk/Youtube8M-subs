 the muscular point of view to face the daily activity 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.130
 percent and other components that are 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 and also linked to this that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.720

 the daily in the daily 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.580
 We have worked hard on the levels of stress that may be associated with 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.720
 for the work he does this year 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 percent and there's also another component that will look like every hand of 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.210
 master prevencionales that are for example factor is tied to the subject of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 security 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.550
 prevents a kennel from being healthy that reaches a level of fatigue 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.950
 less possibilities 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.150
 d 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.460
 decide to take 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.059
 p is a 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.139
 min is a relevant topic at its interesting moment in which 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.349
 the loan 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.239
 there are many people out there 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.830
 he does not know him but we have been here for more than eight years 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 the first case of the type of activities 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.839
 I understand that the consent of Australia 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:27.199
 that with some time some kind of percentage with the company or company 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:32.919
 who do this kind of programs in Argentina contanos a little is known about 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.169
 this matter 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.489
 yes in a very recent publication 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.129
 percent and with respect to some new concept that is installing that is the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.559
 of family business responsibility 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.190
 the austral university did boom 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.190
 a survey of 118 companies in Argentina 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.379
 where he found that only 5% of companies 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.729
 in Argentina but many are multinational intel 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:04.079
 they are carrying out this type of from programs which are looking 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.509
 achieved a balance 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:12.769
 between the daily work within the company and the company responsible for 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.920
 family members who have 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.089
 the collaborators of the company 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:21.149
 the 5 percent is only occupying punctually of this this new 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.699
 demand 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.109
 who is installing 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:30.029
 i 18% was thinking about it considering portal and gas arrest companies 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:34.849
 they still assume it act as if it were a fact others at least in the 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:35.759
 short term 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.549
 is to carry forward which 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.629
 read with this data percent you can have a map of the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.799
 possibility that there will be future growth of activity 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.609
 I understand that in the market very close as it is in Latin America 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.009
 there countries that really are not in the 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:57.259
 on the crest of the wave to say a way on the subject of labor gymnastics 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:02.499
 I understand that Brazil is one of them and that is the argument 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.219
 an activity to tell us a little about the history of this process. 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.129
 It has been and as time to Brazil compared to us look we started 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.769
 with our training in 2001 traveling to Brazil to 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.519
 interviewed in which he was really p 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.220
 the degree of said touch teniente activity within the company really 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.479
 It surprises us a lot because 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.239
 that we realized that the time of the Ministry of Health of Brazil 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:34.920
 c on your website 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.350
 There are specific recommendations for all companies to 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.279
 public as private 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.020
 adopt and adhere to this type of programs 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.020
 apart the year 2005 started with research 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.059
 own as for phallus 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:52.830
 the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.580
 for the activity that we all have 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.840
 and in the year 2006 we can if we review again in Brazil roda per cent 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.120
 they train 2 p in a country like France and that has so 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.599
 ea radiata cultural physical entity 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.520
 and if there were questions how are we we would tell you that we are pretty far with 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.839
 Regarding the works 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.690
 What is your recommendation regarding this activity that I was developing 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.379
 a very long time ago 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.379
 teddy kollek your particular advice 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.300
 the COM 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.560
 I think the potential that exists over the activity this left over 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.360
 on this subject this is to port 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.830
 then so train 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.740
 e very much 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.289
 percent you have to inquire 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.180
 clear about 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.979
 the new ones 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.229
 social demands to be able to understand 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:50.220
 as a manufacturing gesture the conceptual point of view in another federal area 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:53.159
 different from what we were used to facing the practices 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.180
 bodily 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.120
 and without a doubt that it is necessary to be a mature challenge to be able to develop 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.120
 perform in such a techint field 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.759
 the advice is to train and the more
