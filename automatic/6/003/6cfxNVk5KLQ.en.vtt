first<00:04:11.380> into<00:04:12.130> this<00:04:12.340> measuring<00:04:12.910> cup<00:04:13.300> now

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
first into this measuring cup now

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.259 
first into this measuring cup now
purists<00:04:14.740> might<00:04:14.950> strain<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> find

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
purists might strain this but I find

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.160 
purists might strain this but I find
that<00:04:16.390> by<00:04:16.540> using<00:04:17.160> superfine<00:04:18.160> sugar<00:04:19.170> coupled

that by using superfine sugar coupled

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.350 
that by using superfine sugar coupled
with<00:04:20.549> making<00:04:21.549> sure<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.790> very<00:04:22.090> carefully

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
with making sure to very carefully

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.150

little<00:04:27.340> bit<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.700> hot<00:04:27.880> cream<00:04:28.210> before<00:04:28.390> you<00:04:28.720> add

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
little bit of hot cream before you add

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.720 
little bit of hot cream before you add
it<00:04:29.080> all<00:04:29.200> on<00:04:29.380> my<00:04:29.500> start<00:04:29.920> whisking<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> whole

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
it all on my start whisking it the whole

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.970 
it all on my start whisking it the whole
time<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.300> don't<00:04:31.960> get<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.110> lot<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.350> lumps<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:32.950> I

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
time I don't get a lot of lumps so I

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.980 
time I don't get a lot of lumps so I
don't<00:04:33.250> really<00:04:33.430> see<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.940> need<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:35.230> strain<00:04:35.650> it

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
don't really see the need to strain it

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.890 
don't really see the need to strain it
so<00:04:37.990> I'm<00:04:38.080> going<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.320> fill<00:04:38.560> up<00:04:38.590> my<00:04:38.710> ramekins<00:04:39.340> and
