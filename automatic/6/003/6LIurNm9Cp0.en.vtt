00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
you can see I'm kind of placing it at

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
you can see I'm kind of placing it at
the<00:00:42.420> lash<00:00:42.629> line<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.070> working

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the lash line and then I'm just working

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
the lash line and then I'm just working
up<00:00:46.070> into<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.610> rest<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.989> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
up into the rest of it so it's kind of a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
up into the rest of it so it's kind of a
simple<00:00:49.590> wash<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> dark<00:00:50.789> shade<00:00:51.090> over<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
simple wash of the dark shade over the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
simple wash of the dark shade over the
whole<00:00:51.719> lid<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.770> start<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> base

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
whole lid but we start off at the base

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.060 
whole lid but we start off at the base
so<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> looks<00:00:54.300> looks<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:54.899> darker<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so it looks looks a bit darker there and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
so it looks looks a bit darker there and
I'm<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> start<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> base<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I'm going to start the base and then I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.029 
I'm going to start the base and then I
want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> work<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.920> actually
