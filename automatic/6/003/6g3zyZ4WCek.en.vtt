00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.050
 1900 kunoichi or virtual enough synthesis 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.090
 to complete today we are 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.620
 returned on mystic strength and yes 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.089
 you left to have a package 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.699
 video because there are a lot of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 things to do with the mystic forge 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.760
 again it's a recipe that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
 may be practical maybe it's not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.490
 no longer the best waste better 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
 unfortunately you like it swears you have to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 a lot of money to be able to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 show what's happening on the strength 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 mystical 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.760
 so be patient but it will come I 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.910
 think maybe next week 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
 there will be something that starts to 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 to bring back under and especially to cost 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.649
 sous so today I hate you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.450
 last week explain to you 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.480
 how to increase the level of an item 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 basic craft tale 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 if the ore the wood the leather and the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 cloth there this time we will scratch some 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.860
 Exquisite refined components I cross 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 call in french finally good we're going 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.440
 talk back of claws of notebooks and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 other senses so you go you have 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.530
 hockey the recipe is exactly the same 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.360
 only for items 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.040
 basic except that it takes a little 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.100
 less in the recipe so we'll take 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.700
 50 bone ends were graded bone 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.380
 level zero level 1 had last that the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.470
 dose that level 2 so we will take 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.500
 only 50 items of the level you have 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.970
 you will add a theme nest of 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.659
 level where you want to go so from 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.090
 higher level 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.420
 and the same for dust always 5 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.430
 dust of the level you want to go and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.380
 not from the basic level and finally like 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.970
 usually I call you back for 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.820
 latecomers 1 you have stones 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 philosophales we need one each 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.100
 times to make this recipe there etc 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.649
 here and here they wanted wind here and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.759
 well philo so we'll put that and we'll 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.630
 see what comes out so I know that 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.130
 it's a recipe that is very little 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.550
 profitable because it is very little 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.159
 reliable 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.880
 it really depends on how to answer 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.420
 mystic lafarge 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.500
 right now we'll see oh it's not 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.179
 too bad so that's the result c I do not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.239
 not sure if you have read it myself 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:12.049
 give 13 pieces of bone so we go from 50 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.820
 items from levels 1 to 13 level 2 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.620
 knowing that we add dust 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.060
 and it's up to you to judge if it's 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.820
 profitable or not knowing that it can 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 alternate between I believe that people 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.730
 already had one or two items only and that 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.110
 can go up to 30 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.489
 maybe more good me I have not seen more 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.519
 that thirty years anyway and that's it 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.769
 it's already finished 1 for the little video 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.140
 the tricks tips of the fhp stick of the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.670
 and I find you the week 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.410
 next for this time maybe 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.480
 something costs a little bit more 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.500
 will depend nozomi what do you think you 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.700
 going shapes and bo has not 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.290

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.980
