00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 the tenant wp8 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.349
 is the flagship of your wine 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.820
 actually focuses just a bit lower than 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.740
 many other flagships from 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 manufacturers and that actually means 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.800
 that it is right in front of the cargo ships 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.690
 from last year 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 Definitely miss because of the price 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.980
 what will have fallen is the rough we p8 costs now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.910
 450 euros and the htc one m8 that costs 400 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 euros 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.460
 thus the two are important 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.570
 Competitors have become sure of each other 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.489
 because they are also a bit the same 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 adhere to philosophy and in this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.200
 comparison I am all about it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.200
 to tell 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.810
 in terms of design falls the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.489
 aluminum unibody on at htc is that round 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.780
 from the back and on I want 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.489
 ergonomically shaped 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.989
 is nice in the hand and we have 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.800
 also just very beautiful and me 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.750
 concerns 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 yours we have some flatter designs 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.800
 thought you are very tight is something 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.540
 less fine in the hand but beyond 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.370
 and practical is that has especially 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.809
 with the edges around the screen 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 there might be can see 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.530
 there are hardly any differences 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 information even a little longer the rough 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 travel a little wider and two aircraft 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.420
 have the screen format htc 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.050
 has a 5 inch screen you move and 5.2 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.850
 inch screen 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.740
 so yes you have a bit better 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.910
 arranged for me although at 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.649
 it is said that htc 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.000
 two thick boxing above and below it 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.399
 screen do you have we have one 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.560
 speaker on the bottom and there wind 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.119
 very clearly along but yes in terms of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.840
 space is your we just what 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.729
 better 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.229
 nevertheless one in m8 itself takes place 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.990
 bit nicer but that is especially bad 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:41.410
 cheerful and yes some light is a bit 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.360
 what you like about fencing 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.970
 the two smart phones have both a 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.740
 Full HD resolution so the raw has 5.2 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.110
 inch screen c and 5 inch screen 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 are GPS LCD panels and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.520
 do not differ very much in quality 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.840
 a little better in data 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.750
 deeper colors and what is 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.369
 smashing and the viewing angle is better 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 is really one of the best lcd screens 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.090
 I've ever seen 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.319
 in the field of software is, to my mind, one 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.209
 to identify a clear winner 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.280
 and that assists them when they power it 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.180
 has the power to sense sense interface 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 htc 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.840
 and yes that works quickly that got me smooth 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.330
 looks nice 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 he does not have super much extra 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 functionality but just enough that 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.900
 it is handy and i also have little 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.430
 addition find is blinkfeed link bicycle 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.810
 sits on the side of your home screen and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.030
 then you can get all kinds of news and social 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.920
 network in which you as 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.660
 yes you just five minutes to do nothing 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.519
 then you can just go 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.590
 browse through and number 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.420
 read news and I think it's pretty good 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.739
 nice to just have to do that in 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.540
 a shed moment 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.390
 we push has the emotional blows from it 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.069
 yours we wadi's emotion 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.030
 actually a bit yes seems reasonable 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.549
 op aos has no main menu in terms of layout 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.170
 so all applications are boot screen 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.060
 has quite a few functions 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.920
 not added all functions and even 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.500
 useful because I find useful is the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.280
 telephone manager who gives yes 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.890
 just 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.900
 giving access to the kinds of things at 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.700
 manage your telephone 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.350
 memory management network management that kind of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.030
 things that we really add 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.470
 but otherwise I find the interface less 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.760
 beautiful than that of htc 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.450
 and also just less convenient times 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 daily use 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.950
 I've already talked about the speakers 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.239
 the front of the acm that make sure there 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.640
 just for that htc 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.930
 music clearly wins 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.810
 coming from speakers is just pretty good 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 Well at the rental we are speedy money 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.379
 bottom that they are not very much 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.489
 bad but clearly less than that 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.900
 from htc 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.540
 the camera of the hour is already clear 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 better with is a 13 megapixel camera with 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.819
 optical image stabilization and also with 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.799
 RGB pixels 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.049
 so they say there is a white subpixel 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.700
 will be added and that white subpixel 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.430
 which ensures that the dynamic 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.110
 range of it is higher and that he too 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.819
 can absorb more light and therefore it 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.560
 in the dark it does better 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.599
 htc has the ultrapixel camera that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.090
 ultrapixel camera has a large sensor 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.640
 with a few pixels also draws one 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.650
 high dynamic range and that too 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.880
 dark does well so hits lizzie 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.099
 maybe not even that much 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.260
 by that optical image stabilization that 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.250
 the hours are missing in the dark 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.010
 better 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.780
 and certainly if the light is yes then the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.090
 yours with its 13 megapixels 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.169
 put more details on the photo than 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.330
 the 4 megapixel 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.430
 today c also remark is that 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.289
 htc a second camera that is above 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.570
 at that depth has information to one 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.639
 photo adds some nice ones 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.320
 Jokes can play but very much 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.050
 more than that it also does not represent them 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.700
 amia in the end is the hour we are in it 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.350
 just the clear winner 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.090
 htc has on top and infrared port 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.539
 that your TV can control his 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.539
 nice addition 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.730
 you go for music and fine software too 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.470
 a good battery should definitely come with the 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.550
 htc its nation just clearly has the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.169
 better battery 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.820
 I think the interface is a lot better and 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.950
 the speakers in the front they have 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.330
 clear benefits of this nature for sure 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.340
 after the design, there is room for dispute 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.440
 I think that is nicer, but that's good 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.180
 fairly personal but that is huwawei 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.830
 maybe the best anywhere 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.900
 device has to do with the one hand 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.360
 that he is more modern because of his on 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.960
 extra working memory and because of its 64-bit 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.669
 Processor 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.520
 in addition, the camera of the device 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.840
 clearly better and the device is going 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.100
 just new which makes it longer 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.120
 will be updated 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.750
 and of course that is also one 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.580
 device discount is 50 euros more expensive 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.919
 that should make you fall in love i would be there 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.139
 well for having just for one 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.750
 also very good and what modern device too 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.520
 but the differences are like 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.440
 said small and as music more your 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.479
 thing is then the camera or if you like 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.040
 have a very good battery than 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.520
 is therefore certainly not wrong 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.410
 choice 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.800
 that is a little consideration that you will 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.800
 have to make
