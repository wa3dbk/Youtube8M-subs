00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello I do not know what drives people 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.060
 and where did they get such traction 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.480
 any marks on your body that 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.480
 why are tattoos removed 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.060
 creative skin for life I, too 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.910
 I like to draw if any nonsense 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.980
 but since not very expensive nervous 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.439
 the system is my mom I know that all this 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 very quickly get tired i use different 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.100
 ways to again of course give up but 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.650
 short intervals can flat can 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.900
 and children if i can walk one of these 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.530
 ways key and of course plus 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.020
 firstly is it more than that possible 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.010
 erase when you see free recognizable 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.940
 that 's almost 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.640
 a lot of advantages and I think that why 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.020
 how can we live our own life flame 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.690
 simply 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.350
 worry wipe paint 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.500
 painter 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.489
 and then in general today I will show how 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.259
 make a temporary tattoo one of 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.049
 ways because there was still had 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.820
 the success of the business of hygiene and actually everything 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.619
 famous Indian henna first of us 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.390
 will need a marker i will take a marker by 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.470
 fabrics because i have them the most 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.830
 thin rod 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.039
 but any markers would do that. 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.610
 no difference and the second component is 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.600
 clear nail polish in principle dog 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.090
 so what we need to do we need 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.610
 choose a drawing i will take some 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.190
 complication to make it more interesting on so 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.630
 love as if your whim and so we 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.420
 we start to just draw on the skin 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.710
 marker our drawing 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.770
 I advise you to take those places that are smaller 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.409
 Azadi all exposed to it ie 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.380
 bending the elbow hands because we do not take a second 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.380
 all our paint is rolling down 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.679
 also need to take places that are less common 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.090
 just exposed to water then 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.100
 There is for example not palm which we 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.740
 constantly my because there and there 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.420
 the drawing will hold on less well 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.420
 for example on the wrist where I am 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.750
 dream catcher there rubber version is enough 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.750
 long 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.110
 from this it is to draw several layers 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.810
 that is, for example, first sketched 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.780
 black then painted if the court is 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.440
 a button on top of the ears into account and held 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.900
 fatter fatter because we have 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.510
 skin of all sorts of course from these pores and all 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.520
 there are stripes and down the paint is blown out 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.930
 a little spread program need 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.930
 and better to accompany me 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.810
 star 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.689
 you have hands 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.340
 but also after the final stage we 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.760
 just covering our drawing with transparent 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.280
 varnish it saves it for a long time 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.379
 so I can tell you that 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.170
 you skin is covered with a complex of data 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.000
 plant for cover because Malak 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.799
 but then you get used to it very quickly 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.750
 and after a while you are already general 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.879
 notice what you have there than tobacco 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.860
 dependent on the correction screw up any 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.260
 unpleasant sensations do not cause as well 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.459
 many may think that from varnish can 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.629
 be some irritation on the skin 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.150
 for example i went nothing i was much 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.780
 walked with this pattern and ok how 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.709
 calm down nothing terrible will happen 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.040
 but in principle, all I hope I cooked you 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.720
 the curiosity of those who wrote me to do 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.799
 video on how you do pee 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.650
 drawing men 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.650
 but in principle, all good luck for now
