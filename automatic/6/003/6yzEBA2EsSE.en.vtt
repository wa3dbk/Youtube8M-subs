00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
but I certainly know that especially

from<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:13.100> road<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.400> took<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.850> here<00:03:14.030> that

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
from the road I took to get here that

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.750 
from the road I took to get here that
I've<00:03:14.269> never<00:03:14.570> actually<00:03:14.810> secured<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.489> still

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
I've never actually secured that I still

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.300 
I've never actually secured that I still
have<00:03:16.880> plenty<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.239> prove<00:03:17.570> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
have plenty to prove and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.490 
have plenty to prove and
my<00:03:18.670> compete<00:03:19.150> level<00:03:19.480> still<00:03:19.690> has<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.349> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
my compete level still has to be to the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.630 
my compete level still has to be to the
the<00:03:21.489> great<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.390> got<00:03:22.810> me<00:03:22.989> here

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the great it was that that got me here

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.220 
the great it was that that got me here
though<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.670> means<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.030> lot<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.630> again<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.140> were

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
though I means a lot and again we were

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.350 
though I means a lot and again we were
just<00:03:26.290> talking<00:03:26.739> prior<00:03:26.950> about<00:03:27.760> Cody<00:03:28.060> Franson

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
just talking prior about Cody Franson

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860 
just talking prior about Cody Franson
and<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:31.030> know<00:03:31.150> what<00:03:31.300> we<00:03:31.390> were<00:03:31.480> able<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.690> do

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and and you know what we were able to do

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.339 
and and you know what we were able to do
together

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
together

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.250 
together
I<00:03:32.620> think<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.599> puts<00:03:34.599> both<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.959> bit<00:03:35.110> of<00:03:35.140> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
I think this puts both on a bit of a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.339 
I think this puts both on a bit of a
platform<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:36.630> we<00:03:37.630> both<00:03:37.810> together<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.230> want

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
platform and we both together just want

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.320 
platform and we both together just want
to<00:03:38.440> meet<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.069> coming<00:03:39.580> into<00:03:39.700> camp<00:03:40.030> and

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
to meet that it's coming into camp and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.420 
to meet that it's coming into camp and
hopefully<00:03:40.840> he'll<00:03:41.019> be<00:03:41.170> here<00:03:41.410> over<00:03:42.099> here<00:03:42.220> soon

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
hopefully he'll be here over here soon

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.330 
hopefully he'll be here over here soon
enough<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:43.300> it's<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:44.709> just<00:03:44.800> being<00:03:45.040> able<00:03:45.130> to

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
enough but it's it's just being able to

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.490 
enough but it's it's just being able to
match<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.550> intensity<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.019> also<00:03:47.200> take

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
match that intensity and and also take

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.890 
match that intensity and and also take
it<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> step<00:03:47.830> further<00:03:48.480> not<00:03:49.480> with<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.750> year

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900

able to do that for one another and and
I'm<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:13.870> feeling<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.320> pressure<00:05:14.560> as<00:05:15.280> far<00:05:15.550> as

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
I'm not feeling the pressure as far as

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.180 
I'm not feeling the pressure as far as
the<00:05:16.479> quantity<00:05:16.930> of<00:05:16.960> fights<00:05:17.260> I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
the quantity of fights I

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.890 
the quantity of fights I
had<00:05:18.310> more<00:05:18.640> than<00:05:18.790> any<00:05:19.180> other<00:05:19.300> defenseman<00:05:19.810> in

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
had more than any other defenseman in

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.650 
had more than any other defenseman in
the<00:05:19.990> region<00:05:20.260> last<00:05:20.350> year<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:21.420> although<00:05:22.420> those

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
the region last year so although those

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.030 
the region last year so although those
two<00:05:22.810> guys<00:05:22.930> are<00:05:22.990> a<00:05:23.170> great<00:05:23.320> support<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.920> don't

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
two guys are a great support I don't

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.710 
two guys are a great support I don't
think<00:05:24.340> it'll<00:05:24.490> slow<00:05:24.730> me<00:05:24.910> down<00:05:24.940> as<00:05:25.210> far<00:05:25.390> as<00:05:25.420> the

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
think it'll slow me down as far as the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.230 
think it'll slow me down as far as the
way<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:25.840> want<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.110> play
