00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 all welcome on my channel new and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 here's another video is not about this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 minor tweaks associated with the repair and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.090
 Bunch but brought a laptop as we see 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.250
 seen on it so say artifacts 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.400
 on screen he let's take a closer look here 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 but also tricky what is 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 initially it was suspected stand 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 artifact cause video cards here and how 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.950
 make sure that well, as they say so 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.870
 really or not it's very simple 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.809
 that is, we just cling to the monitor and 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.760
 we look at the monitor and on the monitor we 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.140
 accordingly, such artifacts are not 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.199
 observe from which we can conclude that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 the reason is not at all in the video card 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.949
 but in the train, that is, I see 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.920
 elementary put my hand on the laptop and 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 artifacts disappear arm clean again 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.869
 appear well this is a laptop those machines then 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.380
 have a slave they have a very sore point 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.920
 laptop he is all 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.110
 herself flimsy such a whole 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 plastic such all 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 wobbly fragile lope here I machine 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.540
 this is such a big trouble 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.250
 Well, accordingly, these artifacts are even 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.770
 gone 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.390
 suddenly well here but they may appear 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 again can not be more accurate but will appear 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.799
 that is, you see again appeared well, and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.259
 monitor of similar artifacts we do not 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 possess that is accordingly we can 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.799
 almost confidently conclude 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.070
 that the reason is not in the video card given 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 laptop that it is not a video chip namely 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 well, actually, I am in the fact that it is a drain 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.570
 I had no doubt initially but as if 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.780
 did the diagnostics and there experience and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.730
 suspicions are not on the video card but how how 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.050
 it says suspicions did not come true 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.920
 Well, something like that again I repeat not 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.410
 I recommend buying cars at all 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.990
 the budget on the laptop is all so flimsy everything 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 plastic shlif and here so here 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:29.060
 It looks well, apparently all the trick showed 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 bye Bye
