 point me leonoticias.com more than 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.010

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.550
 sexual in the state lara doctor towers 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.520
 the panorama that we already know with the little 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.130
 that we have talked desolate that 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.080
 present the statistics in our 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.370
 region in the first quarter of this 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:43.340
 year 2013 ok this the case for example or 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.710
 gerardo of a child a scholar between 9 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.440
 10 years of the veragacha community of 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.610
 Holy Rose parish that came to our 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.290
 Teenage girls consultation children 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.890
 a sexually transmitted infection by 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.870
 a gonococcal infection or gonorrhea 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.410
 when we do the interrogation 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.620
 we examine the child confesses 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.840
 the patient has had 9 years 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.650
 sexual activity with a number 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 determined of girls 89 couples and by 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.990
 Of course she called us this much 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.400
 reflection and we immediately did the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.660
 interconsultation with our doctor 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.970
 pediatrician and his diagnosis was indicated 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.610
 his treatment and started the 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 monitoring to try to give it 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.040
 solution to this case where obviously 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.440
 there are many risk factors that are 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240
 predisposing these situations not 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.430
 only in this community I think that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.520
 the problem occurs in many 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.710
 communities of our of our 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.250
 iribarren municipality and in the rest of the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 Lara state 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.090
 there is a subject that calls us a lot 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 attention and that also requires the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 care of all doctor towers we are 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.470
 speaking the doctors equate us 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 towers has to do with the contagion 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.520
 the transmission of vph and decide through 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.299
 of objects 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.670
 in places like hairdressers and the same 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.250
 schools because you have to remember gentlemen 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.980
 that the cases of vph in lara we are 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.940
 talking about children up to 2 years old 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.900
 age in the case of caregivers or 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.420
 mothers who work with girls with 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.739
 children 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.780
 maternal in the sense that the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.390
 sexually transmitted infections are 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.860
 transmit in a non-sexual way that 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.730
 it was only omitted objects or instruments 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.520
 contaminated and that the recommendation is 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 that these teachers or these caregivers 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.590
 perform in your comprehensive physical examination 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.930
 emphasizing all areas 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.120
 from the cephalic area to the area 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.069
 genital to rule out any 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.640
 pathology and especially to rule out 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.590
 presenting an infection of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 sexual transmission in a moment 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.130
 determined that can be transmitted 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.799
 non-sexually to that older infant 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.680
 infant or to that preschool or 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.750
 school are two cases that the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.819
 attention and that is resolved in the case 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 of the second caregiver of the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.230
 maternity with simply performing 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.260
 preventive exams you will see to avoid 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.019
 with your health certificate corroborate 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.020
 that do not have any infection 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.210
 sexual transmission and another case 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.530
 we want to finish just give also 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.500
 for thinking, obey that sexual game 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.360
 that is taking place in some 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.760
 educational units 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.520
 both public or private that we are born 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.830
 that are generated from school violence and 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.860
 that school violence that is generated in 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.310
 classrooms will deepen 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.710
 to a violence that not only falls 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.660
 the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.570
 in the sexual thing but what falls 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.810
 other factors are framed, such as 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.940
 the drug family abandonment 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.940
 lack of parental monitoring 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.100
 children who are up to 12 hours inside 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.250
 a public or private school above all 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.790
 in the private part that he should therefore 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.590
 exist a strategic alliance like ips 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.810
 through the health address is 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.210
 promoting the healthy lifestyle program 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.330
 through the pupil through PANASEF 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.610
 through saint and all those 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.390
 institutions that together we can 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.430
 solve the problem of violence not 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.710
 only sexual but violence 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.440
 school within those 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.320
 Worrying statistics in girls children 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.050
 and adolescent in our state lara 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.900
 doctor towers the case of the games 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.230
 sex in schools and colleges of 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.470
 barquisimeto please 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.540
 another important issue in relation to 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.340
 toys or the sexual eggs that today 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.050
 in day they are seeing so much in the part 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.820
 public schools as the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.850
 private institutes as is for example 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.250
 masturbation or self-exercise of the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.470
 sexual function in adolescents as 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.200
 a competitive system to see what 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.900
 teenager has a greater bond 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.600
 and consider yourself the winner or be the macho 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.210
 not in male terms within the group 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.120
 of males and even of females 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.430
 within that level of competence that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.960
 is being presented and that are the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.490
 comments and recommendations 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.160
 they have reached us through 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.260
 interrogation of those patients who have 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.120
 went with his parents to our 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.600
 consultations of children, adolescent children and 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.440
 pregnant women that calls us a lot too 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.720
 to reflection as well as another one 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.280
 type of sexual activity that what 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.340
 we call sex toys that the 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.380
 oral sex that oral sex 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.310
 that is being planted is using a lot 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.270
 also in teenagers 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.600
 regardless of gender 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.090
 female or male and this one also 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.160
 they need they do it with a level of 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.740
 competition but not from a level of 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.710
 erotic sexual satisfaction but 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.410
 simply the sexual game as a 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.900
 level of competing for who they believe 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.479
 that does it better and of course before the 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.300
 absence or non-monitoring of 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:30.850
 teachers on guard allows this to be 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.160
 do in areas of the institute that do not 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.160
 they are easy to see by
