 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.750
 The issue was prepared with the support of our 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 partners 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 construction company npc group and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 today we continue our conversation about 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 hunting cartridge belt but the topic 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.909
 today's talk 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.089
 how to wear ammo for 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:44.839
 rifled but again if you look 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:48.149
 Here is the most classic classic belt belt 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.360
 same company but since we have both 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 rule hunting rifles 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.109
 the store is all removable on this 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.920
 cartridge belts we see a pocket in which 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.829
 you can place this store going 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.179
 on the hunt for the tower 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:12.270
 snobbery shop ammo 4 laid 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:16.170
 we have a shop is located in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.069
 Pocketing go find same understand 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 that is usually 12 shot but no yes no 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.020
 they say that then there is not enough there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 the visitors come to the room and the paintings 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 takes there by himself gave ammo to be more 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.350
 two times shoot will not succeed as 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.140
 the rule is not enough for him 3 someone takes with 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.740
 a pack of 5 he does not give up to shoot 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.070
 never weight still tangible new 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.049
 quests cartridge belt here allows you to have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.469
 Equipped with a store and you can also 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.869
 eliminate these cartridges that too in general 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:54.060
 it will not be at hand as we see 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.060
 here we have 7 14 and the store is usually 4 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 that is, 20 rounds more enough 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 you can even go to war with such 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.299
 cartridge belts 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.850
 quite conveniently affairs representative 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.289
 the cartridge belt they often used but also 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.289
 can hang a court knife 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.709
 naturally allows you to adjust the length 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.440
 what is summer clothes what is winter clothes 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.959
 big enough here adjusting well 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.780
 may be an inconvenience hampering movement 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.190
 but many use all sorts of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.250
 pouches pouches release the same 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.160
 great variety here and classic 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.730
 pouch from the company of the reserve of cartridges 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.720
 put two rows of nests 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.549
 They are made of rubberized fabric with 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.049
 such a wide elastic band chuck securely 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.049
 they also fight very quickly 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.000
 having fun is enough to sit on the tower 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.670
 list of the number open the valve because 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.879
 you can always get the necessary 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.690
 ammunition pouches can also be different 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.660
 types somehow years strongly or even 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340
 eight back dangerous experience so very 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.319
 interesting model when you open 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.209
 lid under weight 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.040
 opens falls and that is convenient movement 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.970
 down just pull there one or two 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.950
 Chuck how many are not always enough 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.970
 failure arm very quickly removed 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.370
 here if a person uses but if 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.359
 previous previous release where we 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.410
 considered ammo for 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.750
 smooth-bore weapon 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.819
 there the cartridge is strictly its diameter 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.219
 2012 16 here here let's say 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:38.579
 cartridges of one group if we take 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:40.469
 chuck 74 p and here, too, 275 are close by 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.420
 geometry is also about to be cartridge belt 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:48.750
 fits both 3006 and 300 win mag in 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.239
 Generally enough universal 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.909
 cartridge belt since the lower has long been 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.370
 calculated under the boards 7 62 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.129
 and the top is also made of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.439
 rubberized fabric and can 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.599
 so that later the caliber 270 is calm 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.139
 It is located here and in the same way 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:11.099
 comfortably seat cartridge 72 to 54 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.109
 I just as well these cartridges fit 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.160
 at all 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.959
 also pouches as we see that is 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.520
 slipped can be used to shine 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.970
 6 different calibers but as previous 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.449
 releases I showed the comparison carbine 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.180
 Mosina when you go hunting with him 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.460
 take out the cartridges itâ€™s loaded 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.080
 battle we can also put format for 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.610
 store or use such 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.580
 outlandish vintage accessories such 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.590
 staff army back rooms 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.320
 throw those years away from everyone a lot 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.440
 here he holds himself already 30 cartridges 6 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.039
 both five pieces but still they 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.310
 100 Kills full of genuine leather 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.710
 German production is the same we 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.740
 we see the cartridge is located but 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.710
 enough it turns out weighty and 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.090
 nevertheless it is possible and so if 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.780
 go hunting 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.190
 all with the chair can be used as 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.500
 regular pouch but if sleep has 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.060
 some big capacity so 10 cartridge 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.800
 You can of course be in your pocket 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.610
 you can use here like me 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.969
 already said vintage pouches 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.159
 Well, the hunting industry offers us 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:35.490
 a lot of things even exist ammunition belt 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.860
 its for caliber 5 6 caliber 22 along 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.639
 yell 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:45.389
 so, too, is an option it is just like that 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:48.389
 so here's a cowboy movie but not 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:53.150
 less these little patrons can 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:56.790
 worn too in such a cartridge belt capacity 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.460
 50 pieces fit just standard 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:05.190
 a pack of such a great one built 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:10.100
 a lot of everything is produced there 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:13.639
 even such double seat belts 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.800
 here as a rule they are placed somewhere here 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.300
 either right side 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.520
 breech so that the shutter does not interfere 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.160
 either on the left side of the target 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.470
 that is, all the same tower can be to touch 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.919
 also pull out that is great great 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.900
 many of these various models 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.180
 which model uses the choice remains 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.100
 for the hunter 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.410
 The issue was prepared with the support of our 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.080
