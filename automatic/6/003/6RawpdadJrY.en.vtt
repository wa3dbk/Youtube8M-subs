00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
one kind of example of how a scenario

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.320 
one kind of example of how a scenario
plays<00:04:43.479> out<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.020> as<00:04:44.979> we<00:04:45.580> go<00:04:45.699> around<00:04:45.789> this<00:04:46.120> map

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
plays out and as we go around this map

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.400 
plays out and as we go around this map
you<00:04:46.539> know<00:04:46.630> some<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.990> these<00:04:47.050> points<00:04:47.289> of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
you know some of these points of

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.930 
you know some of these points of
interest<00:04:47.710> are<00:04:47.830> statics<00:04:48.160> but<00:04:48.310> some<00:04:48.490> are<00:04:48.639> mobile

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
interest are statics but some are mobile

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.510 
interest are statics but some are mobile
so<00:04:49.479> like<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.930> moving<00:04:50.320> caravan<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:51.130> if

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
so like this is a moving caravan that if

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.770 
so like this is a moving caravan that if
I<00:04:51.639> encountered<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.030> Caravan<00:04:52.449> it<00:04:52.570> would<00:04:52.660> go

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
I encountered that Caravan it would go

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.550 
I encountered that Caravan it would go
into<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.470> an<00:04:54.250> encounter<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:54.880> one<00:04:55.000> we<00:04:55.120> saw

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
into a an encounter like the one we saw

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.839 
into a an encounter like the one we saw
also<00:04:56.560> if<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.770> had<00:04:57.070> friends<00:04:57.370> playing<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.699> game

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
also if I had friends playing the game

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.640 
also if I had friends playing the game
they<00:04:58.180> would<00:04:58.360> be<00:04:58.479> moving<00:04:58.690> encounters<00:04:59.259> like<00:04:59.320> I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
they would be moving encounters like I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.950 
they would be moving encounters like I
am<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.800> moving<00:05:00.130> encounter<00:05:00.550> on<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:00.880> map<00:05:01.090> if<00:05:01.720> my

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
am a moving encounter on this map if my

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.360 
am a moving encounter on this map if my
friend<00:05:02.320> had<00:05:02.440> gone<00:05:02.560> into<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.830> point<00:05:03.070> of<00:05:03.099> interest

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
friend had gone into a point of interest

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.620 
friend had gone into a point of interest
I<00:05:03.610> would<00:05:03.729> see<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.060> point<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.389> interest

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
I would see that that point of interest

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.300 
I would see that that point of interest
was<00:05:04.780> occupied<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.830> could<00:05:05.979> join<00:05:06.130> him<00:05:06.280> but

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
it might be more valuable you actually

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.930 
it might be more valuable you actually

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
more dangerous areas but of course we

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.540 
more dangerous areas but of course we
also<00:05:58.210> do<00:05:58.419> have<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:59.320> know<00:05:59.349> dungeons<00:06:00.310> and

here and and while right now just in

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.990 
here and and while right now just in
this<00:06:25.860> prototype<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.400> combat<00:06:26.730> is<00:06:26.820> fairly

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
this prototype the combat is fairly

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.940 
this prototype the combat is fairly
simple<00:06:27.300> basically<00:06:27.690> click<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.080> attack<00:06:28.380> I<00:06:28.650> have

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
simple basically click to attack I have

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.710 
simple basically click to attack I have
a<00:06:28.980> shortcut<00:06:29.280> key<00:06:29.640> here<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.150> some<00:06:30.300> of<00:06:30.390> my<00:06:30.510> more

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
a shortcut key here to some of my more

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.440 
a shortcut key here to some of my more
advanced<00:06:31.170> attacks<00:06:31.920> as<00:06:32.130> well<00:06:32.240> but<00:06:33.240> we<00:06:33.330> have<00:06:33.420> a

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
advanced attacks as well but we have a

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.130 
advanced attacks as well but we have a
much<00:06:33.930> more<00:06:34.080> sophisticated<00:06:34.940> a<00:06:35.940> skill<00:06:36.900> based

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
much more sophisticated a skill based

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.230 
much more sophisticated a skill based
combat<00:06:38.130> system<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.550> just<00:06:38.820> wasn't<00:06:39.150> quite

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
combat system that just wasn't quite

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.450 
combat system that just wasn't quite
ready<00:06:39.450> for<00:06:39.510> demonstration<00:06:40.230> purposes<00:06:40.620> but

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
ready for demonstration purposes but

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.000 
ready for demonstration purposes but
allows<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:42.410> collect<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.590> group<00:06:43.800> of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
allows you to collect a group of

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.310 
allows you to collect a group of
advanced<00:06:44.760> skills<00:06:45.210> that<00:06:45.480> you<00:06:45.600> want<00:06:45.960> to<00:06:46.140> be<00:06:46.260> able

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
advanced skills that you want to be able

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.470 
advanced skills that you want to be able
to<00:06:46.440> invoke<00:06:46.770> during<00:06:47.190> a<00:06:47.250> combat<00:06:47.520> and<00:06:47.910> then<00:06:48.360> they

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
to invoke during a combat and then they

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.660 
to invoke during a combat and then they
will<00:06:48.630> kind<00:06:48.810> of<00:06:49.160> make<00:06:50.160> themselves<00:06:50.550> available

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
will kind of make themselves available

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.840 
will kind of make themselves available
to<00:06:51.060> you<00:06:51.360> during<00:06:51.660> combat<00:06:52.290> based<00:06:53.280> upon<00:06:53.520> how<00:06:53.790> you

have prepared that stack of skills
before<00:06:57.540> entering<00:06:57.960> combat<00:06:58.320> so<00:06:58.440> it's<00:06:58.560> not<00:06:58.680> just

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
before entering combat so it's not just

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.970 
before entering combat so it's not just

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
capabilities up front you know I've

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.260 
capabilities up front you know I've
always<00:07:04.350> made<00:07:04.650> gateways<00:07:05.220> to<00:07:05.250> help<00:07:05.610> you<00:07:05.730> travel

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
always made gateways to help you travel

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.870 
always made gateways to help you travel
across<00:07:06.420> the<00:07:06.630> world<00:07:06.810> quickly<00:07:07.460> and<00:07:08.460> here<00:07:08.760> you

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 
across the world quickly and here you

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.850 
across the world quickly and here you
can<00:07:08.970> see<00:07:09.120> in<00:07:09.210> this<00:07:09.330> case<00:07:09.650> around<00:07:10.650> these

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
can see in this case around these

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.310 
can see in this case around these
standing<00:07:11.280> stones<00:07:11.450> each<00:07:12.450> of<00:07:12.690> those<00:07:12.780> stones<00:07:13.080> has

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
standing stones each of those stones has

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.440 
standing stones each of those stones has
a<00:07:13.350> phase<00:07:13.680> of<00:07:13.890> the<00:07:14.010> moon<00:07:14.220> on<00:07:14.490> it<00:07:14.670> and<00:07:15.120> if<00:07:15.240> we<00:07:15.300> look

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
a phase of the moon on it and if we look

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.000 
a phase of the moon on it and if we look
up<00:07:15.540> into<00:07:15.690> the<00:07:15.780> sky<00:07:15.840> we<00:07:16.380> have<00:07:16.500> a<00:07:16.530> full<00:07:16.800> moon

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
up into the sky we have a full moon

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.409 
up into the sky we have a full moon
right<00:07:17.220> now<00:07:17.400> and<00:07:17.640> so<00:07:17.730> this<00:07:17.880> stone<00:07:18.120> which<00:07:18.270> is<00:07:18.390> a

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
right now and so this stone which is a

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.030 
right now and so this stone which is a
full<00:07:18.660> moon<00:07:18.840> on<00:07:18.960> it<00:07:19.110> is<00:07:19.230> the<00:07:19.620> one<00:07:19.740> where<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:19.919> see

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 
full moon on it is the one where you see

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040 
full moon on it is the one where you see
this<00:07:20.130> arc<00:07:20.400> of<00:07:20.550> going<00:07:20.730> out<00:07:20.880> to<00:07:21.090> this<00:07:21.240> lunar<00:07:21.810> rift

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
this arc of going out to this lunar rift

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.770 
this arc of going out to this lunar rift
and<00:07:22.290> through<00:07:22.860> the<00:07:22.980> rift<00:07:23.160> you<00:07:23.280> can<00:07:23.490> see<00:07:23.820> the<00:07:24.570> two

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
and through the rift you can see the two

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.840 
and through the rift you can see the two
through<00:07:25.050> to<00:07:25.200> another<00:07:25.380> town<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:26.100> that<00:07:26.610> camera

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
through to another town and that camera

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.210 
through to another town and that camera
is<00:07:27.000> actually<00:07:27.300> in<00:07:27.480> that<00:07:27.510> other<00:07:27.810> town<00:07:28.140> and<00:07:28.500> so<00:07:29.040> as

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 
is actually in that other town and so as

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.500 
is actually in that other town and so as
the<00:07:29.430> phases<00:07:29.610> of<00:07:29.760> the<00:07:29.850> Moon<00:07:29.910> change<00:07:30.360> it

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510 
the phases of the Moon change it

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.870 
the phases of the Moon change it
actually<00:07:30.750> changes<00:07:31.080> which<00:07:31.520> gateways<00:07:32.520> these

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
actually changes which gateways these

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.659 
actually changes which gateways these
portals<00:07:33.360> take<00:07:33.660> you<00:07:33.810> to<00:07:34.250> and<00:07:35.250> you<00:07:35.280> can<00:07:35.550> just

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
portals take you to and you can just

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:36.950 
portals take you to and you can just
look<00:07:35.760> up<00:07:35.880> in<00:07:36.000> the<00:07:36.060> sky<00:07:36.270> and<00:07:36.419> directly<00:07:36.660> see<00:07:36.870> it

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
look up in the sky and directly see it

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.970 
look up in the sky and directly see it
or<00:07:37.050> come<00:07:37.169> in<00:07:37.260> here<00:07:37.380> and<00:07:37.470> look<00:07:37.590> over<00:07:37.680> here<00:07:37.890> at

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:37.980 
or come in here and look over here at

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.580 
or come in here and look over here at
the<00:07:38.100> stone<00:07:38.280> itself<00:07:38.960> and<00:07:39.960> look<00:07:40.140> through<00:07:40.410> right

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
the stone itself and look through right

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.170 
the stone itself and look through right
to<00:07:40.620> the<00:07:40.830> other<00:07:40.980> place<00:07:41.250> in<00:07:41.669> the<00:07:41.760> world<00:07:41.790> you'll

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
to the other place in the world you'll

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.060 
to the other place in the world you'll
go<00:07:42.300> if<00:07:42.419> you<00:07:42.510> step<00:07:42.870> through<00:07:43.080> this<00:07:43.169> portal<00:07:43.590> but

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070 
go if you step through this portal but

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.740 
go if you step through this portal but
but<00:07:44.640> anyway<00:07:44.730> that's<00:07:44.940> a<00:07:45.090> little<00:07:45.510> brief

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750
