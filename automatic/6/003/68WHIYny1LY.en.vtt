00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.730 
this a little bit earlier but what this
does<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.710> DC<00:01:50.040> everybody<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> area

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
does is it's DC everybody in the area

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
does is it's DC everybody in the area
it's<00:01:52.740> pretty<00:01:53.040> essential<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's pretty essential if we have a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
it's pretty essential if we have a
really<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.350> group<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.430> don't

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
really really good group and you don't

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
really really good group and you don't
need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.329> could<00:01:57.479> change<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.869> out

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
need to see you could change that out

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.940 
need to see you could change that out
with<00:01:58.820> dragon<00:01:59.820> blood<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.299> need<00:02:00.450> billing<00:02:00.990> or

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
with dragon blood if you need billing or

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.630 
with dragon blood if you need billing or
you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.640> change<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.450> another<00:02:03.899> hour

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
you can change it out for another hour

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
you can change it out for another hour
