 in the second is the adefa 1 point 1 point 2 which is our style the final 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.650

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.070
 the legislator 100 while 1 point 1 points 2 is the open 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.669

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.430
 the site windows 7 or view ponies and this 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.970
 this folder 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.549
 molly altruist the extension 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.729
 this will leave this folder 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.590
 but not in this folder 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.109
 the transporters 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.149

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.190

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.689

 the name that we were bank of water 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.870
 or that to me that is 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.910
 and then the age 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.100
 click on enter telde and I feel something like that 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.189
 but it depends what sews great game will come installed so I do not know 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.349
 room basically this vote 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.519
 the world I am going to install the default to the pirate 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.179
 honestly I prefer 1 point 1 points but I see the 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.119
 with a stand 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.150
 children so you will not get writers talents things that you know was the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.619
 theater sector spoke ireland agreement no shelter 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:45.619
 if any the ceasefire 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.649
 we buy them to open 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.709
 betting biologist because it seems that obama we are going to see because of the canton its 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.529
 study 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.989
 do not abuse extraction April goya 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.239

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.099
 we are not back adecco sala a thing comes to enter nemak and therefore the 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.169

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.389
 percent 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.879
 bonus we give to the lobby 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.009
 and here it will give us an error 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.009
 and we were to believe that the year 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.030
 now we are going to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.370
 without the lawsuit 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.800
 and here we can choose the world and we want such and it is already 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.729
 well basically this game is about building your house your city you 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.189
 a world 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.409

 p 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.839

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:06.550
 such 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.599
 because I honestly do not like the versions and healthy for a hundred 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.419
 those that can enter until players did not stay because he never 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.599
