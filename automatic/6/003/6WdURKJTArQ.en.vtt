00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello friends of the info now starts one more 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.240
 edition of the report answers I am the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.949
 lucas agrela I'm here on infolab com 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.450
 leonardo of the projectile that is 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.340
 possible to train production in the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.470
 this video today we will respond to the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 Diego's question santana he wants to know 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
 which notebook with an intel and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 7 and 8 gb worth of memory 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 currently so in terms of cost 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.309
 benefit ratio in terms of the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 company asks for it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 looks have few options currently with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.089
 this setting you are asking for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 and we will give you two options a mask 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.950
 and another cheaper first here is the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 xps 13 that the best notebook with the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.039
 windows system that you find on the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 market today 1 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.180
 he is at a very high price is not 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.850
 cream 7 thousand out of 7 829 show also has a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 version without sets if you could follow five 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 yes warn against much higher is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.990
 to 7250 I think it's time to do the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.229
 Land Parcelling if this product does not 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.000
 it's worth grabbing the catch soon and 7 more 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.030
 it is very interesting because he has the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.790
 The things you asked for and more is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 another booknet exactly is much more 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.759
 a much smaller stocking much more thinner more 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.850
 Light 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.009
 I use a 256gb ssd exactly 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.150
 and he also has a high frog 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.220
 highest frequency performance 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 so we can test it then 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 a much better notebook than we already 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 tested is great for applications 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.850
 professionals the coolest thing to do 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.649
 have on it 's screen is so up to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.270
 wonderful there it is the largest screen 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.890
 night resolution because we 've seen 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 most of the river to the retina 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 Portugal's moment is 3,100 per nene 1,800 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 km 202 thousand eight hundred and pardon 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.320
 ie it is more than the loose is more 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.790
 than the head occurs and if it comes a 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.759
 day code of postures 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.750
 but it is also the screen itself 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.619
 she has an extremely fine culture 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.810
 is can color creation is also perfect 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.210
 symbiosis that we do not have what it is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.220
 so it is first given better option 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.900
 in the game you can buy today you 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.160
 did not give me the price range so I'm 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.390
 responding 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 according to what we have in the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440
 market, now another option has been 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 the le may imply a little more then 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.300
 If it's hopping now, it's a good thing. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.600
 most basic has something from asus for example 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.820
 s 46 c b that is our much more 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.420
 so it 's not a notebook of the type 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.280
 14 which are usually built one 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 little simpler made of plastic 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.940
 sure but he has one and they serve instead of 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.430
 to light up and another 11 h from 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.880
 the old one and 8 gb of ram 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.360
 the only question is which so you and serve 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.130
 of him is an uplifter in which the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.110
 third generation is selected 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.650
 recognized when the species that has a 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.170
 wheel game reason so the differences 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.600
 of computational gain are not 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.100
 stratospheric 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.950
 but you can tell if you're a reviewer 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.989
 even if you use too much photoshop to use 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.549
 many ipss is how it ends up feeling 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.470
 difference in recording this 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.239
 program specially designed for 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.430
 memory I would say because there is no more 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:31.540
 this dna has contaminated so much 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.549
 the seat of the pga, yes the event generates a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.030
 excellent teacher is because it continues 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.040
 good 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.130
 changed so much has changed so much in so 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.010
 little time does not have then it is an option if 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.630
 consider also this is it and if 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.070
 You have more doubts, you can leave 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.840
 here for people who respond to 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.840
 you're cool even more chan
