00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello friends of learning 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.310
 Beauty dotcom Today I'll teach 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.370
 make this beautiful bridal hairstyle 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.860
 I hope you like the divisions that 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.190
 let's use are three pigtails in the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.160
 back and a split of ear to 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.820
 ear going through the crown for the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.820
 part of forward 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.890
 each of the pigtails we are going to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.079
 pick up with chunks this way 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.379
 now we take the two pigtails of the 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.500
 top part to make room for 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.050
 work in the queue below what 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.440
 let's do first is to cover the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.300
 rubbers with a bit of hair from the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.300
 bottom part of the ponytail 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.620
 and we hold with a hook 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.159
 and we do the same with the other queue 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.170
 always covering the rubbers now let's go 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.170
 to continue with the loops 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 we take small portions of the pigtail 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.909
 we put the hair on the ring finger and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.850
 the middle finger and we turn the hand and there 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.130
 we have our first loop now let's go 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.369
 with our second loop we are going to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.470
 work only the hair root with the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:33.200
 part closest to the root we apply 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:36.229
 lacquer we comb and turn the hair of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.350
 this way and we put a hook 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.240
 up and a hook down 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.720
 so that it sustains us from both sides 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.630
 let's leave the tip of the hair 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 held with a hook 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.969
 now we continue with our next 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.060
 loop we can usually leave the 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.490
 tips to decorate the hair after or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.880
 to put them in another way but sometimes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.740
 there are loops that do not come out then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 we definitely have to roll up the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.420
 hair does not come out because sometimes the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 hair tips are too short 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.769
 or definitely did not give us the form 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.400
 between what we do is that we make a 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.349
 just loop like this and in the other 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.360
 tips that we although of the others 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.530
 loops then we accommodate them to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 final in another way 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.750
 we continue with the next queue 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.220
 we do the same 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 We divide the pigtail into several strands and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.350
 let's do loops let's go 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.470
 rolling in the same way half 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.750
 we leave tips and so on until 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.640
 collect all the hair the loops 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.430
 we are accommodating in different places 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.320
 I can not tell you where 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.140
 exactly because the hair is going 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.570
 accommodating in different ways depends 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.900
 of the hair of the amount of what 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.670
 we want to achieve with the hairstyle 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.860
 then the hair itself is giving us 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.680
 as the space where we can go 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.800
 that looks harmonious that it's something well 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.800
 beautiful 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.349
 Well we have the last ponytail 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.500
 then the hair of this part 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.660
 superior is very short then I'm going to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.239
 have to roll all the hair in 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.030
 the loops so that I fit 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.590
 formed because if I leave the tip 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.160
 out then later I will not be able to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.960
 shape it by how short it is 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.450
 then it's easier to roll everything 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.460
 and now we just roll up the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.760
 tips that we have left from the loops 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.670
 previous to no longer leave any type 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.160
 of hair on the outside we continue with the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.920
 lateral 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.280
 we made a division as diagonal in the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.770
 front and what we are going to do is 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.090
 very simple we are simply going to comb 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.520
 the hair I have stuck to the muÃ±a and we put 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.910
 a little hook at that point and there we go to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.400
 put the decoration touch as the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.590
 combed back has so many loops 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.470
 then in the front part what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.390
 I wanted to leave it as smooth so it does not look 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.390
 too much hairstyle 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.820
 we do the same to the other side we apply 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.040
 lacquer and comb with a pennetta 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.160
 fine tooth so that we do not stay 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.220
 hair come out we give a small 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.840
 return to the hair we put a hook 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.790
 what we are going to do with that lace is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.280
 that we are going to do a loop cited that we 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.130
 cover that end that hook to not leave 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.920
 hooks in sight and finally 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.990
 we put our decoration touch this 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.330
 It is the final result of our hairstyle 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.790
 for brides I hope you liked it 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.790
 a lot and see you in a next video
