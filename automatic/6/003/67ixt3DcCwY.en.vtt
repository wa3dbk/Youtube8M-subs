00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.620
 the auto show is always 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.090
 the opportunity to discover new 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.950
 new model cars 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.170
 but it is also especially the moment of 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.610
 see hot and sexy and yet this 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.369
 year some may be enough 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.230
 disappointed joëlle millet having called for more 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.630
 of decency the hostesses had to go 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.359
 dressing and in particular those of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.599
 at suu kyi we had some brands and 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.640
 we also had some rules and we 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.009
 decided anyway to put in order 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.140
 and that's the result you think what's 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.810
 the charter of joëlle milquet and the fact 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.670
 that you must be less she is 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.370
 much more dressed in fact a part 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.719
 where it stops sometimes it's a little too much if 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.520
 we are there all the way down is all 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.980
 years they sometimes come for girls 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.620
 so we opted for overalls 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.840
 and still a little yes here we see 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.269
 a little our back to our belly but that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.039
 it's still going his bosses so I find 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.929
 one side is a little bit what she 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.730
 said and the other side maybe it's a 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.500
 not too severe 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.629
 I think it's a bit exaggerated because 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.320
 that the living room he needs beautiful 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.140
 beautiful women 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.000
 we need it is in men 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.350
 like that ok I understand that women 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.300
 it's a little bit not done but you have to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.220
 live with I think here is a living room 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.720
 autumn in other countries it's 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.170
 much more naked now here 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.330
 fiat us we 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.650
 feminine beauty it represents a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.659
 beauty car beautiful woman 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.920
 we are at the show all you 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.140
 still find that the hostesses 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.689
 must attract the customer 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.149
 but the car show a name for 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.690
 the little ones too so I think we made 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.280
 that it would not be very it would not be the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.500
 same thing if you say it like that but 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.939
 we also have boys this year ago 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.970
 a role and then at the same time we are there 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.869
 to guide for a little sometimes drawn 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.369
 look interests but look we'll say 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.140
 to be normal is not 20 in 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.259
 certain rules and barriers 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.110
 the border beyond femininity 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.340
 do you find that the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.080
 hostesses must attract customers 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.789
 but precisely by their way of being 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.069
 dressed but of course that's why 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.649
 that they are here for a budget people 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.690
 for them to hunt for not to sell 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.299
 the car but to make people 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.660
 come look at the car they are there 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.640
 for that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 this year low ouzou who took some 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.090

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.870
