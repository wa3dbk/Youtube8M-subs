00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.000 
I believe this lead rope is 12 feet long
I<00:00:36.190> think<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.809> got<00:00:38.019> that<00:00:38.260> up<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.620> around<00:00:38.829> her

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
I think and I got that up and around her

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.099 
I think and I got that up and around her
neck<00:00:39.219> I<00:00:39.519> put<00:00:39.969> it<00:00:40.059> fairly<00:00:40.359> high<00:00:40.510> up<00:00:40.539> on<00:00:40.839> her<00:00:40.929> neck

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.819 
neck I put it fairly high up on her neck
to<00:00:41.230> make<00:00:41.350> this<00:00:41.559> knot<00:00:41.909> because<00:00:42.909> it<00:00:43.089> does<00:00:43.829> get

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
to make this knot because it does get

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.430 
to make this knot because it does get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
you get things loose that's when you

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.100 
you get things loose that's when you
start<00:01:12.310> getting<00:01:12.340> cocky<00:01:12.759> things<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.930> get

start getting cocky things when you get
to<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.380> end<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.770> don't<00:01:20.979> have<00:01:21.159> much<00:01:21.369> more<00:01:21.610> to

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
to the end you don't have much more to

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.840 
to the end you don't have much more to
go<00:01:22.469> like<00:01:23.469> I<00:01:23.619> do<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.860> just<00:01:24.130> got<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> little<00:01:24.610> tag

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
go like I do I just got a little tag

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.730 
go like I do I just got a little tag
sitting<00:01:25.240> out<00:01:25.360> there<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:26.229> still<00:01:26.500> get<00:01:26.710> your

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
sitting out there you still get your

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.859 
sitting out there you still get your
loop<00:01:27.070> here<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.850> go<00:01:27.969> put<00:01:28.180> your<00:01:28.270> tag<00:01:28.509> three<00:01:28.840> loop

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
loop here you go put your tag three loop

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.880 
loop here you go put your tag three loop
then<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:31.960> hold<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.649> your<00:01:33.520> head<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.789> me

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
then I hold on to it your head to me

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.249 
then I hold on to it your head to me
either<00:01:35.890> end<00:01:36.189> up<00:01:36.340> here<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.630> know<00:01:37.750> pull<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.109> and

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
either end up here you know pull it and

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.490 
either end up here you know pull it and
you'll<00:01:38.380> notice<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.680> loop<00:01:38.950> gets<00:01:39.189> smaller<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
you'll notice that loop gets smaller and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.580 
you'll notice that loop gets smaller and
it<00:01:41.649> holds<00:01:41.829> on<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.170> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it holds on to that for you and the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.700 
it holds on to that for you and the
other<00:01:44.710> end<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.369> can<00:01:45.640> slip<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.570> down<00:01:46.719> so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
other end you can slip up and down so

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.550 
other end you can slip up and down so
you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.979> make<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.250> tightly<00:01:48.460> long<00:01:48.850> loop<00:01:49.179> or<00:01:49.990> you

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
you can make it tightly long loop or you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.700 
you can make it tightly long loop or you
can<00:01:50.770> loosen<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:51.850> up<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.170> put<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.469> further

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
can loosen it all up and put it further

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.370 
can loosen it all up and put it further
back<00:01:53.950> on<00:01:54.159> their<00:01:54.340> neck<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:56.049> that's<00:01:56.229> your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
back on their neck and that's your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.310 
back on their neck and that's your
breath<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:57.179> when<00:01:58.179> you<00:01:58.299> get<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.600> spot<00:01:58.960> where

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
breath on when you get to a spot where

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.569 
breath on when you get to a spot where
