espresso<00:00:08.340> polls<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> important<00:00:09.960> because

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
espresso polls this is important because

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.600 
espresso polls this is important because
if<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> do<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.559> wrong<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.130> actually<00:00:11.250> mess<00:00:11.490> up

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
if you do it wrong you actually mess up

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.220 
if you do it wrong you actually mess up
the<00:00:11.700> coffee<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.120> everybody<00:00:12.269> else<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.690> that's

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
the coffee for everybody else and that's

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.440 
the coffee for everybody else and that's
not<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.799> call<00:00:13.980> googly<00:00:14.370> alright<00:00:14.880> so

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
not what they call googly alright so

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.640 
not what they call googly alright so
let's<00:00:15.630> start<00:00:15.839> by<00:00:15.929> talking<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.320> grinder

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
let's start by talking about the grinder

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.680 
let's start by talking about the grinder
the<00:00:17.520> most<00:00:17.699> important<00:00:18.119> thing<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.240> make<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> good

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the most important thing to make a good

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750 
the most important thing to make a good
espresso<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.500> using<00:00:19.859> good<00:00:19.980> beans<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
espresso is using good beans and the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.519 
espresso is using good beans and the
difficult<00:00:21.359> thing<00:00:21.480> about<00:00:21.539> beans<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.439> they

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
difficult thing about beans is that they

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.160 
difficult thing about beans is that they
get<00:00:22.680> stale<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.430> fast<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.330> hopefully<00:00:25.050> those

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
get stale really fast so hopefully those

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
get stale really fast so hopefully those
beans<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> hopper<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.460> isn't

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
beans in the hopper but if there isn't

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.009 
beans in the hopper but if there isn't
you<00:00:27.000> leave<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> load<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.570> from<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.900> these

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you leave the load one from one of these

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
you leave the load one from one of these
containers<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> white<00:00:29.369> ring<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.730> top

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
containers there's a white ring on top

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
containers there's a white ring on top
it<00:00:30.330> needs<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> come<00:00:30.750> off<00:00:30.869> when<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.619> after<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it needs to come off when they after you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.229 
it needs to come off when they after you
take<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.070> off<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.059> you're

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
take it off put it back on when you're

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.310 
take it off put it back on when you're
done<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.899> seals<00:00:34.140> this

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
done because that's what seals this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
done because that's what seals this
container<00:00:34.790> you'll<00:00:35.790> pour<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> beans<00:00:36.270> into<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
container you'll pour the beans into the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.920 
container you'll pour the beans into the
grinder<00:00:38.149> when<00:00:39.149> you're<00:00:39.270> filling<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> grinder

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
grinder when you're filling the grinder

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
grinder when you're filling the grinder
only<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> cup<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:41.070> maybe<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.760> you're

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
only put in a cup or maybe two if you're

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760 
only put in a cup or maybe two if you're
in<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.180> busy<00:00:42.450> location<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.530> beans

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
in a really busy location because beans

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
in a really busy location because beans
get<00:00:44.010> stale<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> couple<00:00:45.450> of

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
get stale really in just a couple of

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
get stale really in just a couple of
hours<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.620> you're<00:00:46.710> grinding<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.160> beans

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
hours and when you're grinding the beans

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
hours and when you're grinding the beans
you<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.660> grind<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.469> know

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you really only want to grind you know

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
you really only want to grind you know
maybe<00:00:49.920> enough<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.910> shot<00:00:51.210> because

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
maybe enough just for your shot because

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
maybe enough just for your shot because
ground<00:00:51.809> beans<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.230> stale<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.010> 20

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
ground beans go stale in as little as 20

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
ground beans go stale in as little as 20
minutes<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.140> start<00:00:55.350> maybe<00:00:55.590> by

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
minutes so you can start maybe by

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
minutes so you can start maybe by
emptying<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> stale<00:00:56.910> bees<00:00:57.620> general

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
emptying out the stale bees general

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.779 
emptying out the stale bees general
location<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.129> people<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
location where people have a lot of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.529 
location where people have a lot of
these<00:00:59.879> lessons<00:01:00.270> yet<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> grind<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
these lessons yet and then you grind the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500 
these lessons yet and then you grind the
beans<00:01:04.489> just<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.640> ahead<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.850> turn<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> grinder

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
beans just go ahead and turn the grinder

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.330 
beans just go ahead and turn the grinder
on<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> pull<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> engine<00:01:08.240> until<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> have

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
on and pull the engine until you have

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
on and pull the engine until you have
about<00:01:11.340> enough<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.180> fill<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> basket<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
about enough to fill the basket all the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.429 
about enough to fill the basket all the
way<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> talk<00:01:14.540> once<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> soul<00:01:15.930> turn<00:01:16.140> off<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
way to talk once the soul turn off the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.850 
way to talk once the soul turn off the
grinder<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.840> rub<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.080> hand<00:01:19.229> across<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.710> top

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
grinder you rub your hand across the top

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
grinder you rub your hand across the top
you'll<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> clean<00:01:20.430> level<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.869> wipe<00:01:22.080> off

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you'll get a clean level you wipe off

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
you'll get a clean level you wipe off
the<00:01:22.409> excess<00:01:23.900> tamp<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.580> maybe<00:01:26.580> 15<00:01:27.000> pounds

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the excess tamp it down maybe 15 pounds

and I'm pulling a double shot so I'll

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.850 
and I'm pulling a double shot so I'll
press<00:01:40.259> two

press two

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.910 
press two
this<00:01:42.550> should<00:01:42.760> take<00:01:42.910> about<00:01:43.150> 20<00:01:43.870> to<00:01:43.990> 25<00:01:44.290> seconds

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
this should take about 20 to 25 seconds

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560 
this should take about 20 to 25 seconds
for<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.130> double<00:01:45.400> shot<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:46.090> you'll<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.450> the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
for a double shot and you'll see the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.510 
for a double shot and you'll see the
time<00:01:46.780> come<00:01:47.020> out<00:01:47.140> there<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:48.190> notice<00:01:48.430> at<00:01:48.490> first

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
time come out there you notice at first

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.150 
time come out there you notice at first
the<00:01:49.180> ground<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.780> coffee<00:01:50.320> came<00:01:50.590> out<00:01:50.710> dark<00:01:50.950> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
then comes out this light tan color

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.950 
then comes out this light tan color
which<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.710> called<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.070> crema<00:01:54.660> if<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:55.810> get

and<00:02:04.010> there<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.090> go<00:02:05.620> about<00:02:06.620> 23<00:02:07.130> seconds<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:08.030> can

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and there we go about 23 seconds you can

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.969 
and there we go about 23 seconds you can
adjust<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.660> time<00:02:08.930> by<00:02:09.290> how<00:02:09.470> hard<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:09.920> how

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
adjust this time by how hard and how

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.500 
adjust this time by how hard and how
much<00:02:10.160> how<00:02:10.430> hard<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.759> press<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.240> how<00:02:11.390> much

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
much how hard you press and how much

much how hard you press and how much
coffee<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.140> put<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:13.430> seems<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:13.820> too

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
coffee you put in this seems like too

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.880 
coffee you put in this seems like too
big<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.240> pain<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:15.170> are<00:02:15.320> these<00:02:15.470> espresso

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
big of pain there are these espresso

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.150 
big of pain there are these espresso
pods<00:02:16.190> which<00:02:16.730> basically<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.680> coffee<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
pods which basically have the coffee and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.320 
pods which basically have the coffee and
a<00:02:19.190> pre-measured<00:02:19.520> amount<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:20.000> will<00:02:20.060> save<00:02:20.210> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
a pre-measured amount that will save you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.550 
a pre-measured amount that will save you
the<00:02:20.420> trouble<00:02:20.570> working<00:02:20.960> with<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> grinder

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
the trouble working with the grinder

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.150 
the trouble working with the grinder
trick<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.550> if<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.450> has<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> green<00:02:23.900> logo<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
trick is if it has a green logo on it it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160 
trick is if it has a green logo on it it
goes<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.490> basket<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.930> has<00:02:27.020> an

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
goes in basket down if it has an

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.600 
goes in basket down if it has an
embossed<00:02:27.440> logo<00:02:27.680> which<00:02:27.980> wouldn't<00:02:28.220> show<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.430> on

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
embossed logo which wouldn't show up on

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.020 
embossed logo which wouldn't show up on
this<00:02:28.730> video<00:02:29.000> anyways<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.780> goes<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.230> logo<00:02:30.740> up<00:02:31.030> so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
this video anyways it goes in logo up so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.670 
this video anyways it goes in logo up so
for<00:02:32.210> example<00:02:32.240> in<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.750> case<00:02:32.810> 3<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.350> logo<00:02:33.530> goes

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
for example in this case 3 and logo goes

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.680 
for example in this case 3 and logo goes
down<00:02:34.300> under<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> head<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:37.400> each<00:02:38.000> one<00:02:38.300> is

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
down under the head and then each one is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.440 
down under the head and then each one is
a<00:02:38.750> single<00:02:39.140> shot<00:02:39.970> when<00:02:40.970> you're<00:02:41.060> steaming<00:02:41.270> milk

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a single shot when you're steaming milk

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.400 
a single shot when you're steaming milk

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
you got a couple of different options

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.949 
you got a couple of different options
from<00:02:42.740> low-fat<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.490> whole<00:02:43.820> milk<00:02:44.060> really<00:02:44.840> that

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
from low-fat to whole milk really that

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.330 
from low-fat to whole milk really that
is<00:02:44.990> based<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.470> preference<00:02:45.860> whole<00:02:46.160> fat
