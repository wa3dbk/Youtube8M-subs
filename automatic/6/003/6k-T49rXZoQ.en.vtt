00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 so my ladies and gentlemen there we are 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.180
 again a new episode call of duty about 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.930
 Warfare The game is currently loading 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.570
 synchronized and then wait for the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.340
 Other players from level says Skull 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.350
 and nothing less media last episode 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.609
 so far about these virtual glasses 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.590
 talk that we can do it again 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.850
 Justin must be newer and ph are always 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.859
 I'm still in the opinion that it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 in the future as one of the two 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 Factions will give one is against 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 bring these virtual and the others 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.920
 are real freaks and are just 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 the opinion that everyone should have one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.129
 and that everyone then holds his world 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.219
 then it should be designed 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.399
 again people who say no 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.440
 that destroys the reality that makes 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 Everything broke but I think so too 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.010
 Glasses will be future I have to leave 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.480
 and to take a break concentration 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 I think these will be in the future 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.090
 Eyewear also very much with television 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.430
 or other events are starving, for example 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.010
 concerts then sits on these glasses 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 and need a concert then stand 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.890
 no idea in the concert is actually 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 a robot with a 360 degree camera 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.630
 and you can rent this robot 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 or just pay for a ticket and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.159
 then you can be happier than on the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.549
 concert would be you look out of it and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.200
 then you see the singer the rapper 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 maybe the boxer too 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 soccer game so much is possible 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.200
 in the future 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 it will be very interesting as the future 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.390
 is thus created with the glasses 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.590
 eventually the glasses will be too 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.570
 the tvs are sitting 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.100
 or it will come a technology where 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.640
 one wore no glasses but needed in the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.640
 TV look purely into the tube 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.290
 So I'm really curious the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.820
 Feasibility is there because it is added 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.680
 there are already 360 degrees cameras and the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.450
 actually to do this sooner 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.040
 Internet connection so we all have 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 We will all have all the technologies 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 things are already given only one man 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.330
 have to combine the ones together and zac 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.540
 Do you have this virtual roaring me 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.670
 on the other hand, on the other hand 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.300
 thinks too that's too much of that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.860
 good 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:38.050
 where is the whole thing tasting the whole thing 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.060
 So this whole virtual go 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.140
 glasses 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.730
 you are a virtual space, so to speak 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.090
 that can not end well 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.090
 opinion 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.390
 that was the philipp we wanted 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.220
 just a country does not realize that 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.620
 at someone and friends determined at 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:08.010
 justin just we could not do it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.220
 Sorry, damn I have already 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.810
 damn it heat when so 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.540
 conclude with this virtual 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 virtual worlds 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.739
 when to say okay that too much of that 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 good if you can find it myself 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.060
 cool if you have such a room is no 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.569
 Imagination with the future you still live in 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.250
 beds evacuate virtual visit our 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:35.579
 not always on the ground and or the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.819
 The floor is as soft as a bed 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.150
 could still do 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.530
 So we are already losing again 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:49.790
 what you could possibly do 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.889
 would be like the matrix latching 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.209
 believes then everything would be over 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.169
 then to the very singles world 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.329
 caught and your nerves your muscles 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.760
 everything is connected to his machine 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.250
 and if you die there dies so 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.840
 also in real and thereby you can 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.840
 up to 200 years old but in 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.480
 This virtual world is completely different 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.669
 You know what you do not know 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.489
 Moving or something will always be nice 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.470
 something reingespritzt and no one 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.409
 wait for you but there is persistence 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.419
 For example, I'm in favor of robot iboxx 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.539
 iboxx helping out in life 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.530
 moment not to say that what is already 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.349
 again, nice living but also 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.539
 I do not think that burned down 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:37.770
 anyone in their due in team 316 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.820
 justin what's going on there 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:46.400
 although 21 8 no matter we see it as 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.400
 next nice day bye bye
