 1 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.090
 at 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.240
 in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.640
 now imagine that we pay the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.830
 shipwrecked from a large panel in the heart of 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.080
 the storm our group was separated into 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.330
 two halves is found on an island 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.910
 deserted and the other half on another 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.289
 ford come from the first each he is 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.510
 vast and offers all the riches 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.910
 necessary to ensure sufficiency 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.610
 material and promote self-fulfillment 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 of each as to the human community 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.530
 who lands on every he exists in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.589
 each one all the skills for 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.239
 recreate pleasant living conditions 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.680
 after dealing with the urgency for 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.870
 ensure survival in the first 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.299
 days the settlers of each they decide 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.250
 to organize to build the basics 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.449
 of a happy future it appears very 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.220
 quickly that a monetary system 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.400
 facilitate the production and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.960
 trade in goods and services produced 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.930
 on the island that we will call lille to 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.640
 an ex-banker manages to convince the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.680
 community to copy the system 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.659
 traditional that she left by the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 sinking force after all says he 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.560
 is not this system he ensured 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.950
 the strongest development in the West 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.929
 on the other hand on island b after a long 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.579
 debate it was decided that an organization 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.890
 decides monetary resignation 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.179
 collective would be created mandated is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.869
 controlled by a double assembly 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.869
 citizen 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.390
 one elected and the other drawn amanda 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.310
 course and not surprisingly renewable 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 same distance the two he presented 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.009
 many commonalities among others a 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.439
 wide river 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.689
 cut each island in half and you had to 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.030
 make a big detour upstream to 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.469
 reach the other party obviously the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.929
 solution lay in the construction 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.729
 of a bridge everything was there longvic of the 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.340
 build the technology to do it 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.350
 labor the materials stay at 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 define only how people 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.469
 who were going to devote their time to this 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.149
 work of collective interest 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.649
 she is is paid on the island to the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.450
 banquet proposed that the community 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.139
 is organized like any big company 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.999
 civilized 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:10.550
 in other words, she is developing a 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.040
 taxation whose income would make 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.810
 possible such investments this 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.020
 was needed all the more precisely this precise he 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.819
 that beyond the construction of the bridge to 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.060
 the presentation also the question of 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.880
 communications 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.950
 health education brief needs 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.849
 of common utility and addition 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.489
 is announced is heavy 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.099
 before the growing concern of the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.560
 population the banker wanted 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.510
 reassuring in tranquilize you said he 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.910
 if you can not afford me 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.260
 repay the capital I will ask you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.870
 payment only of interest 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.140
 until you are able to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.239
 pay me back the principal a bit to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 go back the settlers agreed 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.980
 however, because he did not see 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.090
 absolutely no way to do otherwise 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.030
 however, the bridge was built 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.010
 decided at the narrowest point of the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.519
 river in the name that it was the best 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.769
 in law 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.060
 actually two more choruses and a lot 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.720
 better suited to the needs of the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.090
 population 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.080
 but that was where it cost less 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.569
 dear on lille b a debate has started 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.250
 to check first if a bridge and 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.530
 is really the best answer to 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.360
 problems that arose then what 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 kind of bridge is the place that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.489
 best suited to respond to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.390
 needs of populations with the least 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.760
 talk about ecological 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.250
 the decision was made democratically 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.650
 the project was encrypted and the organization 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.209
 resignation created the currency necessary for 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.150
 as the advancement of 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.530
 work to compensate actors 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.230
 engaged in the realization of this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.480
 work 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.109
 two years later each he had his 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.150
 bridge but to a near 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.010
 while on lille b the bridge was 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.260
 paid and matched exactly this 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.290
 that people were waiting on 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 the island to the people and the homework 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.299
 bleed to pay off debt 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.160
 unless of course accepting to pay 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.980
 taxes to infinity to settle us that 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.810
 short interests a little perspective 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 conducive to forget the frustration 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.100
 that had left the need for 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.019
 implantation we adapt do you see 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.389
 the dawn of the new world ahead 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.910
 if we take the full measure of this 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.789
 which has just been said here today we 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.410
 live on the island unfortunately has 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.419
 money the obligatory passage to have 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.490
 access to what it takes to live 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.210
 how many people in the world 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.039
 die every day 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.900
 for lack of food or lack of 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.780
 care not that food or 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.789
 drugs is lacking but because 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.550
 that they do not have the money to 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.610
 access and are counted by dozens of 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.580
 thousands every day the lack of money 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.960
 you more than ten times the number of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.080
 victims the twin towers of new york 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.000
 in the utmost indifference 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.099
 can we accept this longer 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.889
 when we realized that the 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:00.400
 modern currency is created from the 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.990
 only human will that would feel 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.080
 you if you were to agree to leave 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.030
 your child die on the sole pretext that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.810
 you do not have the money to do it 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.000
 heal right now if we go out 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.550
 our present mental we could be 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.889
 on lille b it would suffice to reverse the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.449
 model instead that money determine 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.849
 what we can or can not 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.710
 to make it be what we decide 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.110
 humanly possible and just to do 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.880
 who determines the amount of money to 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.639
 put into circulation 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.949
 everything is ready for that by having released 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.349
 the gold coin has been released from the 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.330
 false value as at the conferred and 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.080
 to free it from the scarcity to which 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.849
 gold condemned her by having released the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.680
 money of gold we gave ourselves the 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.139
 possibility to adjust much more 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.419
 finely the amount of money in 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.930
 circulation with the real needs of 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:56.099
 peoples by having freed the currency of 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.229
 gold she became a virtual unit 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:02.440
 which are created from the only 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.539
 human will by having released the 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.210
 an amazing gold coin 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:10.150
 opportunity for better life and justice 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.639
 social offer to all at the same time 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.909
 that the means to meet the challenges of 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.210
 our time without other limits than this 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.770
 that we want and can achieve 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.490
 however, that the creation 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.490
 monetary 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.659
 denat anyone use the power 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.599
 exorbitant 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.370
 it's like possessed the magic lamp of 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.259
 tales of the Arabian Nights one who 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.110
 holds her can realize all her dreams 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:37.449
 and according as his master makes him serve 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.210
 his egocentric interests or those of the 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.740
 community for collective well-being 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.159
 consequences are obviously 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.159
 very different
