00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 tick and butler roller is removed for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.549
 channel 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 nailing poroshina here today will be video 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.390
 not about the carburetor 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.539
 a lot of carburetor car and because 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 what is the topic I do not know it will be someone 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.660
 no wonder everyone noticed that when 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.660
 turning on 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 electric fan revs fall 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.270
 so I thought how can I do 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.739
 to turn the fan on 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.660
 rose and when you turn off the fan 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 accordingly disable them ours with us 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 included headlights fan load gives 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 on the generator and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 turnovers fall in this I came up with one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 simple thing once show for this us 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.879
 need a valve not to mo valve 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 systems about their 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.870
 ozone slightly modified and here already 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.890
 the cap is worth initially he goes here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 so this is the side electrode from 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.320
 side tube connects with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 the atmosphere we have this nipple 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.590
 we don't suppress him because he 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.590
 will interfere 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 Next will need a threesome washer 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.400
 windshield and vacuum tube 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.470
 connects as follows ie 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.950
 vacuum 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.320
 tube goes beyond the throttle space 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.540
 on the valve and through the tee on the vacuum 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.060
 corrector solution lights 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.600
 when the fan is turned on the valve 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.910
 opens gives permission for a vacuum 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.710
 Ignition collector runs forward 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
 rpm increases when you turn off 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.050
 fan valve closes and again 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.590
 everything returns to its original position 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.610
 electrical part one wire with us 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 goes but plus ignition the second goes 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:09.190
 wire to the negative sensor which we have 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.110
 when it is on minus 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.660
 no minus appears only when sensor 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.010
 triggered 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 that is, if you have everything right 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.190
 you are assembled 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.950
 sensor terminal shoot you short circuit 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.220
 turnover will increase to now I will show 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.220
 how does it work action 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.000
 what does it give us 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.380
 i.e 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.290
 a little increase in turnover 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.870
 literally saw at 200 turns this to us 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.319
 gives that is liquid faster 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.090
 starts running to cool well 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.069
 the generator starts to give at least some 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.500
 current is too good here is not environmental 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.950
 I know well, I 'll be that early ignition 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 idle earlier plans 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.849
 ecology is even better now foresee 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.180
 the question is how the car behaves on small 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.160
 throttles if the valve opens 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.940
 ignition ignition does not respond 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.769
 why because when you drive even on 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.480
 1 gear in second gear you 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.819
 choke a little bit just a little but he 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.500
 open and accordingly a hole in 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.209
 vacuum carburetor 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.989
 is already in behind the throttle 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.760
 space and valve opening 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.519
 reporting directly to the collector does 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.310
 will not affect it already I drive 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 more than a week I like the system and 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.080
 no unpleasant twitching reactions 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.180
 jerks when turning on no 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.490
 the only thing you notice is unusual 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.470
 at idle times essentially the momentum rose 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.780
 stood for a while and returned to their original 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.080
 I will repeat the situation 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.100
 one nozzle vacuum on valve 2 fee 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:47.020
 god through tee on that vacuum 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:52.090
 distributor and one wire for plus ignition 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.860
 2 minus the radiator sensor minus 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.669
 should only appear when u 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.600
 you turn on the fan when the sensor 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.380
 will work if you have enabled 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.910
 ignition engine running 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.680
 closed on the mass turnover rose 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.610
 worked it means you collected everything correctly 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.340
 if it doesnâ€™t mean look somewhere you are wrong 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.700
 But in general, and all I hope the video will be 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.700
 useful to someone
