00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello friends and welcome to a 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.429
 new video for the channel and today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.059
 speak a little green for general 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.650
 the canaries the scream is pretty 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 important especially when we are 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 outside the breeding stage where the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.039
 canaries feed completely to the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.390
 time they have Welsh seed is very 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 important so this is the script that 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 use I do not know how long it takes a couple of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.600
 kilos 5 kilos that what it takes is a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.440
 good a good boat and I lasts a lot 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 for a year or a year and a peak so 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.450
 He messed up more and it's very important 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 for digestion of the bird so 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 let's take a little and I'll show you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.270
 more or less for what works and what 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.710
 are its beneficial properties for 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 channel so we started 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.970
 good and here we are with the grill 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.340
 tell you that 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.750
 As you can see, it's practically sand 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 It is a piece of rock or 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.290
 or of shells worth the writing to a 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.170
 more or less reasonable size so that what 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.720
 can eat the birds or use it to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.900
 its description and good and most 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.270
 important here or also 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.570
 contradictory is coal as you can 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.909
 look over there what black is it 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.880
 carbon particles 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 natural coal as you can see how 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.370
 stain your finger 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 it's coal so the good the coal 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.640
 Well, it's good to kill killer bacteria 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.770
 of leaking bacteria and everything bad by 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.310
 example if the water is a bit bad it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.090
 they are starting to misplace this help 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.040
 Good to be affected as little as possible 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.650
 the bacteria 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.890
 and he does not swear the bird but he helps her to something 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.220
 he does it so that it is contradictory 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.590
 for birds that pigment if you 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.990
 dais pigmentan good you this gray like 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 You see, it does not have much coal, but if 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.760
 I had enough coal what this does 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.310
 coal is to absorb the pigment and not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.940
 lets it reach the blood or feathers 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.250
 and it would not be worth anything, you already know in 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.430
 breeding season 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.290
 You can not give him give him goldfinch is 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.040
 all that to channels does not do much 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.650
 missing because they practically give 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.880
 fed pasta-based a bit of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.180
 mixture and broccoli so it does not 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180
 a lot 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.440
 the primary thing about this is to use it to use it 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.840
 outside the breeding stage from 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.150
 summer just when summer is over 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.489
 it starts the autumn and the winter there is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.930
 where you have to use it 100% because it is 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.340
 where you have to give birdseed mixture and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 the whole class of seeds and they will be 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.690
 fed seeds removed from the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.300
 breeding paste worth 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.220
 so as you can see I'm going to 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.870
 say because it's almost the most important 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.260
 of this has 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.379
 it has small small shells chubs 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.300
 of shells that what helps is to give 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:34.080
 calcium the birds 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.080
 it is very very important it is worth the instant 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.400
 as you can see it also has as a 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:43.640
 sort of pieces of shredded pieces 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.640
 of 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.859
 of shells worth that what it gives is 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.459
 calcium to help along the 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:58.840
 winter happens bones are 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.689
 strong and do not have deficit of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.609
 Calcium also worth no more 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.650
 important now let's go to the most 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.810
 important because it is what it is used for 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.400
 one hundred percent what I told you before was 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.189
 they were simple side benefits for 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.459
 what canaries use is for the 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:22.030
 digestion in the stomach or link the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.340
 gizzard or whatever you want to call vale 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.610
 as you know beak birds stop 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.810
 and what they do is peel the seeds 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.770
 but what you have inside the seeds 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.349
 they swallow everything and go to the gizzard valera 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.840
 They do not have teeth like we do not 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.690
 they crush in the mouth so what does 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.090
 this once in lavalleja that is like 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.349
 muscle that crushes because what it does is 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.050
 function the function of some teeth like 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.210
 ours but that are close to 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.669
 stomach is worth as much more stone of this one 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.729
 have a better digestion 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.690
 and much better will be the absorption of 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.370
 nutrients from that seed and they will not have 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.659
 constipation problems 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.330
 and none of that is one hundred percent to the 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.130
 digestion the function towards the solution 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.310
 is of teeth crushes helps the 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.810
 crushing the seeds so now 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:26.010
 you know what it's worth to give it to her 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.889
 in the fall winter and before before 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.409
 start it 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.630
 the breeding stage and then in the taper 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:36.080
 you can give them 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:39.080
 but since they are based pastas and 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.330
 broccoli well is not very necessary 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.849
 OK 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.800
 but you can give equal you can give 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.590
 Like me for example I do not give it to him 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.569
 because I have many birds are pigmented 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.999
 so 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.819
 how I have the fear of coal this 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:58.759
 absorbs the important one because it healed me in 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.679
 health and I do not give it to him but within about 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.559
 months I'll give it to you until I start 

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:05.929
 through the breeding season so 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.419
 you know but what is useful to give to the 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.909
 let me leave the light in the comments 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:15.229
 Any doubt I will be happy to 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:17.779
 answer it and subscribe to it is very very 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.339
 important, so we'll see each other in the 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.339
 next video goodbye
