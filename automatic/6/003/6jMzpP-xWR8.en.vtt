00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
using bacon and hot dogs but it really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
using bacon and hot dogs but it really
does<00:01:18.900> make<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> refreshing<00:01:19.409> difference<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
does make a refreshing difference so I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.760 
does make a refreshing difference so I
highly<00:01:20.549> recommend<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.320> teriyaki

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
sauce now I suggested to put a little

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
sauce now I suggested to put a little
extra<00:01:25.680> potato<00:01:26.100> starch<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> want<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> use

extra potato starch if you want to use

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
extra potato starch if you want to use
it<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> glaze<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.290> doing

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

it more like a glaze which we are doing
today<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.579> leave<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> sugar<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
today and just leave the sugar in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
today and just leave the sugar in
because<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.500> salty<00:01:32.130> sweetness<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
