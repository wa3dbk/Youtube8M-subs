00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 to all and welcome to the boxes of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.630
 the week then as a preamble 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.490
 I want to apologize 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.690
 for the top 10 things that you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 may not have on the League of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.960
 champions where I said 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 the mistake is human it was george 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 cuias who scored in the 1992 final 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 the olympic marseille goes this record 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 while it was basile boli I see 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.180
 on oneself football cultures I 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 knew before the promulgation and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.109
 of efforts say things we have 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 well here we had the team in turn 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 patrice evra if you want costs 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.000
 we do not have any right now 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.309
 after we go to the red supreme sauce 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 that I put myself by the way is the first 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.360
 and by the way only red card is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 assigned to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 not well surrounded but the cries of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.649
 monkey of some supporters on the sidelines 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.960
 match 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 cska moscow manchester city in the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 part of the league of the champions it is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 not good then udaf was seized from 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 so damaged folder of the year 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 socials benjamin in camera before a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.090
 time what to do that deal with that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.980
 so the funny thing is when the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
 racism is combined with stupidity here is a 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.170
 little slideshow of the players who 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.540
 compose we composed the team of the cska 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 moscow people there seydou doumbia origins 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.240
 Ivory Coast one of the best scorers 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 of the club 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
 he was very kind to be here in china 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.049
 the hamaide mussard 20 years to the origins 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.540
 nigeria the most players 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.170
 promising of his generation and finally going 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.360
 well man 1 to 2004 2012 he wore 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.369
 the colors of this club and he scored 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 more than 130 so for these supporters 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.820
 we make the little cries of a monkey 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.450
 we enjoyed it all the same at his party 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.689
 etc. 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.890
 at least we would have told us go 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530
 we pass everything that grazed the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.079
 Corrections 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.720
 the first day of your craving nc for 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 patrice evra the waves is the new 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.439
 case that they held in suspense 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.590
 so why not a roll rolls 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.079
 then explains on the form on 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.140
 aggression on the tramp's timing 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.229
 it's in direct red but for 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.060
 roland screwdriver and luis fernandez this 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.000
 evening I was thinking even the best 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.860
 engines we could not write that and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 also for the franchise because we have 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.709
 the habit the speech to his policemen 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.750
 footballers yes it's true that the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.970
 phone calls as you advance him the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 say that the soul times he does say 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.640
 but unfortunately what is said 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.770
 already not bad 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.860
 so that's why he's going great style 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.450
 orange yellow it's good the second yellow 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.720
 of the week the zone of scot 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.360
 she is here it is for arturo vidal the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.440
 middle of the turin juventus author of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 his way the biggest simulation 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.620
 never realized in the world of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.620
 football we return ten matches in a row 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.420
 next to it I think sometimes you have to not 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.840
 explained here justify 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.730
 behaviors in this case this is in 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.890
 the more unlikely it is unlikely 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.310
 here I think it's time to move on 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.160
 to the beautiful action of the week to 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.329
 vosges is it's blue card 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.360
 obviously it's zlatan 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.549
 what week they use lower then 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.750
 his booty me shot of the mylene scorpion 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.220
 pigeon went around the world 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.160
 apparently she lifted her leg to a 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.940
 meter 66 so that's where it is 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.140
 pauline there and then his quadrupled face 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.110
 internet in championships are 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.560
 second and third goals its axis ap / 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.040
 dad 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.530
 and then he managed to reconcile the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.870
 public internet with the Parisian bus has 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.380
 really the word they applauded the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.840
 player and well me in bonus blue card 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.239

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.670
 psg for France for laurent blanc 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.299

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.160
