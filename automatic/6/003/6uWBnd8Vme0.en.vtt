00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.300
 the piece of the verve bitter sweet 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.840
 symphony is a piece that has been very 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:15.100
 known in the 90s composed by 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.779
 of English it's understanding that I'll 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.839
 proposes is an arrangement clearly 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.220
 simplified our tone that means 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.169
 that you can not play with 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.269
 original piece unless you know 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.980
 knew and you know how 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:32.500
 use the transpose function of your 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.480
 keyboard mine is here but the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.090
 first line is the melody of 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 piece in itself the second and 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.950
 third lines are lines 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.280
 inspired by other pieces that have the 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.040
 same chord grid fado sol minor d 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.860
 that's what I had I mean by a 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.160
 Chordsheet chaining agreement 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.240
 which is proposed in the piece so 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.190
 respect the fingering 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.690
 working in acute here is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.510
 works around his back and he is not 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.239
 from the central doubs of the keyboard the 2 the 2 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.860
 keyboard central you remember these 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.630
 notes that is relatively low on the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
 partition here we work rather around 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.050
 from the back and saw the first note being lefa 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 acute you notice a new 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.700
 notation in this piece of bach with 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.200
 2.2 partido each row 7 are 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.880
 resumption bars so that means 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.150
 that you have to play each line twice 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.370
 here is leader, you have to play twice 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.460
 that there is between these two of these two 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.680
 symbols so 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.100
 I will play twice each 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 line I put the metrodome a little bit more 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.810
 quickly that 60 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.100
 you will understand that for you 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 train you have to go a lot more 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340
 slowly 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.190
 Let's go 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 e 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520
 Oh 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
 1 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610
 1 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
 no 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.720
 in 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 years 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.069
 be careful of the silence at the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.319
 last line if she combines the first 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.970
 line too but we've already seen it in 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.290
 other pieces so normally this 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.650
 subtlety should not pose any 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 problem 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.450
 if you did the four pieces 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.450
 before
