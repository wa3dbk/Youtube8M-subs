00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 then spend on the commemorative day 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.769
 of dishonored mothers being gilded with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.450
 sorry for not having money is normal 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 miss the opportunity vacilÃ£o 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.850
 So cool, how can you do this? 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 here on the street and through the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.769
 50 60 depending on size 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 here is done for free i 'll show you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.970
 how do you do here in our 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.730
 Cardboard is exactly what you buy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 in the same paper street and do exactly 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 this way and here you can make it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.340
 without spending a penny 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.600
 first make a mold 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.670
 in heart format that is the theme that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 and we do not do anything 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:53.239
 It's a good idea to do this if 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 cardboard decoration paper and 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.050
 then transfer to the cardboard 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:05.119
 transferring the cardboard you do 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.790
 picks up a strip of cardboard in the 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.270
 that you want the box will stay 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.670
 cut and makes several folds of it is noble 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.970
 All to be more malleable by rat 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:23.899
 hard to mold and ideal for making 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.869
 this is to do with which with the folds 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.520
 all went missing even if they were 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.200
 to stay horizontal is bad to fold 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.219
 off the other side 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 and remember that seems to be left here 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.710
 ready first low is ready for 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
 retelling that first part is ready 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.149
 and now just take the paper and reflect for 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.130
 inside 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.860
 then suddenly you may reflect a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.630
 a4 paper package it and then make 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.960
 a second call with you 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.000
 prefer to stay more but strengthen more 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.110
 cute and then do it right with 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 the paper you want 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.980
 made it recalls the bending Remainder 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.599
 out sticks and does the same thing as 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.560
 another is all around the heart's 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.569
 setback on the outside and beauty first part 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 of the test 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.420
 then you will see cut out what goes 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.549
 be the cap 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.000
 this part has to be done after 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.260
 You do the whole first part. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.060
 because the troops will have to be a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.150
 little more than talk to me about the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.140
 box measurements and if you want to 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.160
 she will look the same and 90 will remember 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 the cardboard and does the same thing as you 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.270
 made the bottom 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.490
 record with thin strip almost dollars to 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.610
 vertical glue coats with papers in 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.120
 White 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.490
 okay all coated paper in white 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.350
 Beauty is exactly the way you are going to stay 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.550
 these parts were a bit cuddly like that 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.650
 Appearing 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.430
 It's no problem not to leave it to 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.290
 dry 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.470
 she will stay she will lower all the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.290
 ideal is you hang glue in the whole heart 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.060
 There's nothing left without glue. 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.060
 not to force too much 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.440
 ok sprout and there is now only spend 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.900
 second layer second layer I 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.900
 I speak is a role you want 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.829
 I was out of paper to do some 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.110
 thing 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:57.610
 got any ink and then the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:01.629
 guardians afraid of people on the side sees 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:09.489

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.000
 cover 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.389
 it will be much more more liquid have 30 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.389
 millions 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.289
 I give a hand before white paint on 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.839
 top of the paper 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:43.379
 just to give a finish and better 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:46.050
 because he did not have the role even more to 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.759
 Whoever wants to be very nice is also the 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.849
 gift paper 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.020
 It is something that I think that 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.020
 reply, will you spend? 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.980

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.889
 a couple of minutes ago I made this truck 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.749

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.749
 Ready , but it's cool. 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.889
 exactly as they do 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:37.240
 those that are sold in law stores 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.240
 you pay 50 60 or more 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.540
 that's it 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.360
 and now puts it in your pocket 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.650
 or whatever you want to put inside the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.090
 taxi that puts a lingerie there goes to 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.820
