the this idea that somehow there's a

I<00:02:09.100> think<00:02:10.100> if<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.729> was<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> secret<00:02:11.750> way<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.080> do

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
I think if there was a secret way to do

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.890 
I think if there was a secret way to do
that<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.770> would<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.550> tried<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.150> would<00:02:14.780> have

that I would have tried it I would have

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.500 
that I would have tried it I would have

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
done it what I can do is I can make the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.300 
done it what I can do is I can make the
best<00:02:17.780> possible<00:02:18.050> argument<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.960> can<00:02:21.650> offer

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
best possible argument and I can offer

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.590 
best possible argument and I can offer
concessions<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.380> offer<00:02:25.300> compromise<00:02:26.300> I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
concessions and I can offer compromise I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.970

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
can negotiate I can make sure that my

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.250

not being ideological or thinking about

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.540 
not being ideological or thinking about
these<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.560> terms<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.890> political<00:02:37.100> terms

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
these just in terms of political terms

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.760 
these just in terms of political terms
and<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.630> think<00:02:38.810> I've<00:02:38.930> done<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.410> will

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and I think I've done that and I will

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.040 
and I think I've done that and I will
continue<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.460> that<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.330> what<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> can't<00:02:41.840> do

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
continue to do that but what I can't do

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.790 
continue to do that but what I can't do
is<00:02:43.510> force<00:02:44.860> Congress<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.150> do<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.300> right<00:02:47.330> thing

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
is force Congress to do the right thing

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.710 
is force Congress to do the right thing
the<00:02:48.800> American<00:02:49.130> people<00:02:49.400> may<00:02:49.580> have<00:02:49.720> the

right now we're gonna have these these

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.850 
right now we're gonna have these these
cuts<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.520> place<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:11.870> again<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:12.320> hopeful

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
cuts in place but again I'm hopeful

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.650

about<00:03:13.070> human<00:03:13.340> nature<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.610> think<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> over

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
about human nature I think that over

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.300 
about human nature I think that over
time<00:03:14.900> people<00:03:15.080> do<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.470> right<00:03:15.620> thing<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.070> I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
time people do the right thing and I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.210 
time people do the right thing and I
will<00:03:16.520> keep<00:03:16.790> on<00:03:17.030> reaching<00:03:17.989> out<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> seeing<00:03:19.040> if

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
will keep on reaching out and seeing if

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.120 
will keep on reaching out and seeing if
their<00:03:19.400> other<00:03:19.820> formulas<00:03:20.480> or<00:03:20.690> other<00:03:20.810> ways<00:03:21.770> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
their other formulas or other ways to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.460 
their other formulas or other ways to
jigger<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.700> thing<00:03:22.910> into<00:03:23.120> place<00:03:23.300> so<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.660> so

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
jigger this thing into place so that so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.890 
jigger this thing into place so that so
that<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.830> better<00:03:25.010> result

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
that we get a better result

next several months because teachers at
these<00:04:06.440> our<00:04:06.620> bases<00:04:07.069> are<00:04:07.159> typically<00:04:07.519> civilians

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
these our bases are typically civilians

these our bases are typically civilians
they<00:04:08.810> are<00:04:08.959> therefore<00:04:09.200> subject<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.890> furlough

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
they are therefore subject to furlough

they are therefore subject to furlough
which<00:04:11.060> means<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.569> they<00:04:11.750> may<00:04:11.959> not<00:04:12.140> be<00:04:12.950> able<00:04:13.010> to

which means that they may not be able to
teach<00:04:13.569> one<00:04:14.569> day<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> week<00:04:15.400> now<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:17.620> expect<00:04:18.620> that
