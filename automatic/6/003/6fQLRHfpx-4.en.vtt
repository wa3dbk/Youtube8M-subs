fanatic for example going to switch

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.199 
fanatic for example going to switch
fully<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.739> teams<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.519> think<00:03:36.820> are<00:03:37.000> going

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
fully what teams do you think are going

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.520 
fully what teams do you think are going
to<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.709> top<00:03:38.950> 10<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.610> cs<00:03:40.030> go<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.420> future

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
to be like the top 10 of cs go in future

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.240 
to be like the top 10 of cs go in future
I<00:03:42.590> think<00:03:43.459> at<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.209> moment<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:45.319> players<00:03:45.620> or<00:03:46.190> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
I think at the moment the players or the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.309 
I think at the moment the players or the
teams<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:47.030> came<00:03:47.690> from<00:03:48.110> source<00:03:49.000> haha<00:03:50.319> more

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
teams that came from source haha more

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.790 
teams that came from source haha more
chance<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:53.060> win<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.360> tournament<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.620> what

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
chance to to win the tournament but what

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.770 
chance to to win the tournament but what
I<00:03:54.830> think<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.459> players<00:03:55.730> who<00:03:56.000> can<00:03:56.209> who<00:03:56.569> came

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
I think the players who can who came

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.580 
I think the players who can who came
from<00:03:57.290> one<00:03:57.740> point<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.520> have<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.060> train<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.720> to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
from one point is we have to train to to

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.020 
from one point is we have to train to to
train<00:04:00.830> her<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.610> just<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:03.260> get<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.620> level

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
train her and to just to get the level

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.020 
train her and to just to get the level
like<00:04:05.030> them<00:04:05.239> no<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.260> don't<00:04:06.560> know<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.830> team<00:04:07.040> Putin

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
like them no I don't know the team Putin

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.479 
like them no I don't know the team Putin
could<00:04:08.600> be<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.170> best<00:04:09.380> but<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.860> think<00:04:10.130> verygames

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
could be the best but I think verygames

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.040 
could be the best but I think verygames
could<00:04:11.209> be<00:04:11.330> one<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:11.930> them<00:04:12.110> I<00:04:13.030> really<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.090> must

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
could be one of them I really I must

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.819 
could be one of them I really I must
think<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:17.030> me<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.480> one<00:04:17.870> point<00:04:18.200> six<00:04:18.500> players

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
think for me the one point six players

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.440 
think for me the one point six players
hut<00:04:19.310> or<00:04:20.769> maybe<00:04:21.769> more<00:04:22.040> skill<00:04:22.430> maybe<00:04:22.850> they<00:04:23.540> are<00:04:23.780> a

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
hut or maybe more skill maybe they are a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.840 
hut or maybe more skill maybe they are a
more<00:04:26.450> with<00:04:26.750> they<00:04:27.169> have<00:04:27.380> more<00:04:27.770> level<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.730> know

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
more with they have more level you know

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.360 
more with they have more level you know
but<00:04:29.570> we<00:04:30.080> don't<00:04:30.260> know<00:04:30.410> really<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:31.040> know<00:04:31.160> this

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
but we don't know really don't know this

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.670 
but we don't know really don't know this
then<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:31.850> salt<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:34.520> don't<00:04:34.940> know<00:04:35.090> really

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
then in salt so I don't know really

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.290 
then in salt so I don't know really
which<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.370> best<00:04:37.520> teams<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.210> world

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
which is the the best teams in the world

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.790 
which is the the best teams in the world
but<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.290> think<00:04:39.590> ninja<00:04:40.160> spin<00:04:40.400> Yama<00:04:40.610> verygames

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
but I think ninja spin Yama verygames

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.820 
but I think ninja spin Yama verygames
CSK<00:04:42.800> fanatic<00:04:43.760> they<00:04:44.360> all<00:04:44.570> are<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.410> top<00:04:45.590> 10

CSK fanatic they all are in the top 10

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.450 
CSK fanatic they all are in the top 10
for<00:04:46.490> sure<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:48.200> talked<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.860> said<00:04:48.890> you

CCS<00:05:26.919> CSS<00:05:27.919> ago<00:05:28.160> sighs<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.760> say<00:05:28.910> souls<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.660> know

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
CCS CSS ago sighs to say souls you know

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.790 
CCS CSS ago sighs to say souls you know
so<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.490> think<00:05:31.640> we<00:05:31.940> know<00:05:32.289> more<00:05:33.289> or<00:05:33.410> less<00:05:33.590> we<00:05:33.770> know

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
so I think we know more or less we know

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.480 
so I think we know more or less we know
the<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.610> other<00:05:34.729> game<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.350> i<00:05:36.350> think<00:05:36.770> is<00:05:36.919> my<00:05:37.130> my

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
the the other game and i think is my my

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.659 
the the other game and i think is my my
personal<00:05:37.880> opinion<00:05:38.240> it's<00:05:38.479> hard<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.380> play<00:05:39.669> 1.6

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
personal opinion it's hard to play 1.6

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.800 
personal opinion it's hard to play 1.6
is<00:05:40.850> a<00:05:41.030> hardest<00:05:41.930> game<00:05:42.460> that's<00:05:43.460> why<00:05:43.640> I<00:05:43.729> think<00:05:44.210> the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
is a hardest game that's why I think the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.029 
is a hardest game that's why I think the
one<00:05:45.380> point<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.800> players<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:47.090> have<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.620> better

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
one point is players we have a better

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.870 
one point is players we have a better
chance<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.789> do<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:51.140> do<00:05:51.400> history<00:05:52.400> in<00:05:52.820> the

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
chance to do the to do history in the

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.279 
chance to do the to do history in the
physical<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:53.780> know

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
physical you know

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.649 
physical you know
so<00:05:54.949> it's<00:05:55.129> probably<00:05:55.399> also<00:05:55.759> the<00:05:56.089> experience

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
so it's probably also the experience

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.899 
so it's probably also the experience
because<00:05:57.050> 1.6<00:05:57.800> at<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.159> bigger<00:05:58.369> tournaments

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
because 1.6 at the bigger tournaments

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.230 
because 1.6 at the bigger tournaments
and<00:05:59.559> in<00:06:00.559> comparison<00:06:01.189> to<00:06:01.339> see<00:06:01.520> a<00:06:01.550> source<00:06:01.909> which

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
and in comparison to see a source which

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.510 
and in comparison to see a source which
is<00:06:02.270> in<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.080> last<00:06:03.229> few<00:06:03.499> years<00:06:03.589> we<00:06:04.129> didn't<00:06:04.430> have

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
is in the last few years we didn't have

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.689 
is in the last few years we didn't have
really<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.969> big<00:06:05.149> tournaments<00:06:05.779> up<00:06:06.229> of

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
really the big tournaments up of

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.129 
really the big tournaments up of
probably<00:06:07.699> cup<00:06:07.969> making<00:06:08.270> games<00:06:08.629> they<00:06:09.080> were

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
probably cup making games they were

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.829 
probably cup making games they were
really<00:06:09.559> big<00:06:09.770> but<00:06:10.039> apart<00:06:10.430> from<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.659> just<00:06:11.659> on

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:11.839 
really big but apart from that just on

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.260 
really big but apart from that just on
let's<00:06:12.710> call<00:06:12.949> it<00:06:13.159> smaller<00:06:13.520> tournaments<00:06:13.879> in

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
let's call it smaller tournaments in

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.809 
let's call it smaller tournaments in
comparison<00:06:14.899> to<00:06:15.050> CS<00:06:15.349> 1.6<00:06:15.529> do<00:06:16.339> you<00:06:16.430> think<00:06:16.639> that

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
comparison to CS 1.6 do you think that

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.739 
comparison to CS 1.6 do you think that
is<00:06:16.999> also<00:06:17.210> playing<00:06:17.629> a<00:06:17.839> role<00:06:17.990> there<00:06:19.240> it's<00:06:20.240> like

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:20.749 
is also playing a role there it's like

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:24.070 
is also playing a role there it's like
you<00:06:21.349> know<00:06:21.499> I<00:06:21.770> i<00:06:21.889> think<00:06:22.819> that<00:06:23.089> the<00:06:23.419> cyst<00:06:23.749> see

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
you know I i think that the cyst see

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.649 
you know I i think that the cyst see
swords<00:06:24.379> pliers<00:06:24.819> places<00:06:25.819> source<00:06:26.059> because<00:06:26.449> they

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
swords pliers places source because they

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.510 
swords pliers places source because they
don't<00:06:26.930> like<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.469> one<00:06:27.649> point<00:06:27.889> seat<00:06:28.099> or<00:06:28.279> they

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
don't like the one point seat or they

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.179 
don't like the one point seat or they
are<00:06:28.699> worst<00:06:29.389> players<00:06:29.839> in<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.229> 1.6<00:06:30.889> you<00:06:31.069> know

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
are worst players in the 1.6 you know

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.869 
are worst players in the 1.6 you know
that's<00:06:31.969> why<00:06:32.180> I<00:06:32.209> think<00:06:32.779> if<00:06:33.529> they<00:06:33.889> move<00:06:34.129> another

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
that's why I think if they move another

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.689 
that's why I think if they move another
game<00:06:35.180> because<00:06:36.050> they<00:06:36.289> may<00:06:37.099> be<00:06:37.129> they<00:06:37.279> run<00:06:37.550> away

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
game because they may be they run away

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.999 
game because they may be they run away
against<00:06:38.689> the<00:06:38.749> grand<00:06:39.020> oasis<00:06:39.319> the<00:06:39.559> goose<00:06:39.709> my
