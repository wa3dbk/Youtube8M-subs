00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hi girls, are you all good, my loves today? 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.209
 I brought a very easy makeup for you. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.209
 a neutral makeup using shadow 3 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.759
 if I brought several makeup here 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.490
 neutral is for you only using palettes 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.070
 normal what is the difference in a3 from crohn 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.980
 through it is harder to smoke her 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.289
 falls a lot makes a lot of dirt and most 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.390
 of people use 3d shadows to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.419
 make colored makeup person building 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 do makeup or other 3d consulting 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.660
 today I taught in step by step so 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 doing this makeup did very little 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 suggest I think I forgot to talk 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 but I did little dirt because I did not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 I know only pins and Russell gave it too. 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 make a used tea since consumption in 3d 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 makes her prove to be less into doing - 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.879
 I suggest then you can prepare your skin 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.469
 before the 3d shadow if like I did 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.960
 I really hope you like it on 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 tutorial and enjoy the making let's 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.100
 check go girls will start make 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 and today I'm from Trakinas halfway through 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:11.280
 look just completely different 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.380
 Good today. I taught you half well. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 simple and very neutral with palette having 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.360
 I started using the urban trailer 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 hot middle of sample line on the 3d 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 has a lot of pigmentation if you do not 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 you do not have to use any other 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.939
 which I decided to use because I have 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.329
 Then the temptation gets better. 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.509
 I used this collective here. 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.890
 broke 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.829
 rose this from here rosÃª roso 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 I bought it from a friend of mine. 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.990
 thirty-five reais and it's been a long time 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 Now all she has broken technical and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 she used a lot of 3d palette today in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 day is no longer used so much but neither 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990
 but most women have and do not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 know how to use as currency three should 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.659
 many colors but many even the most 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 of women who use it only use it to 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.489
 do color makeup do not know how to do 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.319
 a neutral makeup with a 3d buoy by 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.810
 example I think a makeup of another 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.760
 have to have a mash shadow and then it is 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 true and today I came to show you 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.470
 that it is possible to make a makeup 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.930
 neutral with 3d shadow is not necessary 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.360
 use all those extravagant colors 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.760
 the model I made today is only neutral 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.660
 all beautiful just with the shoulders had to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.150
 To start I'll use this kiss more 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.569
 and enjoyed this brown and gray then this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.850
 use a beige or gray or brown and where 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.830
 Only black, then these four 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.470
 neutral colors I'm going to wear makeup 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.819
 gil that I picked up on her top cuddly 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.959
 straight with is the ne10 date you like with 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.190
 A shade kiss and I will apply here in 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.190
 every movable eyelid 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.970
 from the beginning the shadow of her 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.370
 better pigmentation when used 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.209
 with the model because of it has more 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.739
 force 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.840
 so I 'll apply here a little bit 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.650
 with your finger to see you look like her 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.989
 was much more segmented than when 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.690
 I was using it with the brush 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.420
 Let's talk about this so you can use 100 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.739
 km there will be a cuddly coconut brush 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.500
 with the brown shadow and I'm going to make a 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.380
 I'm standing here just as I am. 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.709
 I closed you smoke in another video does 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.260
 the risk quinho and then pulled with who 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.010
 really dramatic is much better says 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.769
 smoke 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:56.250
 So I 'll pick it up like that. 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:59.549
 missed most smoked qui in 3d room 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.340

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:07.000
 pay with a small brush and shadow 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.600
 a little black 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.750
 son chaises and I'll bring a 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.630
 A little like that just to darken a 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.730
 to finish by the ambition of 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:28.630
 eyelid with gray shade from below and 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:33.960

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.340
 most beautiful back with the beige shadow one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.200
 A little light here in the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.840
 front do not lose glare and I will not 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.060
 put eyebrow in India because as 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.090
 all are 3d shadows and I do not want to use 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.190
 then kill the new place because in 3d 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.210
 up will draw the attention of more 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.310
 it will be cool 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.380
 so it's better to leave with nothing than 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.169
 put another will get ugly with the same 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.210
 thin brush and gray shade I 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.130
 I liked that it yields to the root of the lashes 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.620
 I'm going to use the stylus pen today. 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.950
 nature nature 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.320

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.870

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.790
 thirty-six reais and go there and I'll do it 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.200

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.320

 so I think it looks very beautiful with a 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.659
 neutral shade tone 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.330
