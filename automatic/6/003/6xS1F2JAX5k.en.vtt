00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello in welcome for this new tutorial on the main frame i'm going 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.299
 show you how to make a pass of rendering visit to all the man who is going 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.599
 allow us to create crazy 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.419
 one is as you see on this cardboard picture a madness of depth of field 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.900
 in a last week of how to do it it's pretty simple enough 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.589
 quick 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.399
 firstly we are the scene so there we go you see many to be done 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.129
 they are very different the position of each other in which are in 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.150
 in front of the camera are others that are far from the camera 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 but as you can see it here in addition to camera 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.650
 so to make a pass of zidane already we will go in limestone 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.540
 sellers here yesterday 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.580
 we'll make sure that the pass you have here at home normally she 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 is checked by default 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 % but better to make sure they are hidden 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.770
 by opening our stage so once that we are we are 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.620
 so once we are assured that this pass and that we go 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170
 select the camera 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 we're going to go into camera options and we're going 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260
 look at this option here down a people who she wants 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 so in focus here we can choose an object word 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070
 now I'm going to choose the sphere 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.780
 006 so this is the one that is at the very end here as you dry manager you 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.480
 can see that name that appears down here 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.670
 so this is the object that will be happy that men who is going to be net 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.590
 in our misfortune 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.700
 and so once we have set this option we will be able to go serra 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.620
 so the fact 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.560
 rendering 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.490
 so now that the rendering is over I'll go here a role 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.710
 in the compositing I will activate otto lindner backdrop heliose does not order 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399
 I'm doing shale in space in this space 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.320
 up 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.940
 to maximize the window and I will not add 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.130
 a plane 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 to see 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.220
 my image 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.900
 so that's our picture 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.970
 and now add lombard 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.950
 a focus fixator 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.660
 right here 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.310
 we will take the place was calling when we will put 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 in the zag here 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.909
 we will put 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.020
 the composite wizard and we will make other residents pay like that 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.399
 that will tell you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.249
 to the software to use the pass of rendering so ideas to what one calculated 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.189
 and we will reduce their stocks so we will put it to 5 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.529
 and you see that so the spheres that are in the foreground are rubbed 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.629
 unlike the sphere that has been defined in the focus therefore illegal 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.899
 the sphere 006 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.579
 so who is perfectly net carrier 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.430
 completely 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.689
 Enfocus 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.599
 so now if you want to see your zidane pass 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.799
 if you do you have here and you put it in the picture see that it's 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.300
 completely white so why is it because 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.639
 obviously they can pay a year by a gang of actors that is added 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.929
 a package is there so we see our password zidane so with the spheres 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.689
 black abandoned that sound more 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.460
 alas this do here 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.759
 which is filled 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.939
 so do not forget if you want to visualize this basic idea to six 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.619
 points only add to 1 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:07.489
 normal vector asia between the two to be able to view this name do you 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.269
 will you end up with something 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.049
 completely white 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.149
 so that's nice 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.579
 mersen got a little bit 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.059
 if you look here will see put my son tarnais focus 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.619
 the result is not optimal 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.519
 ap 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.609
 physics on certain parts of the image this one saw that we have blur 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.389
 wayne simmonds was too much here we still do not really know it at a super nice 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.339
 % 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.169
 a crowd of depth 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.169
 it could be more here you see we still see 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.219
 the ridge in our sphere so there the edge of our sphere 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.799
 and adjusting the construction site nice but I do not know 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.629
 awesome awesome which is a way to have a 10-yard pass a little 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.640
 better he would go further calculated 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.909
 but who will give us an optimal result 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.559
 so for that I will remove the focus 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.559
 I will branch as before 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.969
 I come back in the same defect 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.949
 and here 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.999
 I will not increase the size of the rent is not an angel at the door 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.519
 zero comma to 1 and I will redo a rendering so see it at 46 seconds 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.759
 I close a rendering 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.490
 and see that now the depth of field fool is applied 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.419
 directly on the image so there for germany 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.040
 finally the rendering time and even lower than we had before 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.840
 surely because I closed some programs meanwhile 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.720
 so there the rendering time is not that different but on scenes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.419
 more complex normally usually in any case it's a 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.990
 choice a little - by quickly 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.729
 so 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.910
 if we come back here see that here we learned to 1 in the editor mode me 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.449
 directly an image that is put in the player has no effect that these 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.259
 therapies 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.879
 yet the image and still crazy that's so that's the depth of 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.860
 field that is directly in the camera so we have not two 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.009
 e of idep what is composite and 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.139
 from the outset the mayor 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.539
 so after that it will be played just with 7 9 7 hours opening so we can the 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.930
 reduce for example to 3'05 no what will do a depth of field - 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.360
 say groulx have grown apart from the sale of 25 and here it's going to be 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.819
 almost completely crazy about the whole picture so do not put it too much 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.240
 of German players 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.960
 it will depend on your living room for this famous inseparable rule 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.960
 and you see that so if we come to emphasize this time 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.650
 on stage 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.290
 see that we have a really better result than we had with the 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.589
 goes from two ideas to all 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:35.259
 we really have a sphere that is completely depressed this one has a 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.020
 little less this simple - and this is completely masters 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.360
 whereas what we had before and that the paz and zidane it was a little crazy it is 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.270
 there it was not really here had overflowed 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.500
 a little broadcast by the government is not very beautiful 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.430
 while there it really is to a camera oven as a schedule 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.729
 in real life 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.930
 so that's how to make a Zidane pass emblem elsewhere how 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.569
 do this crazy depth of field two ways 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.059
 so you choose which one you prefer on more complex scenes 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:06.729
 it may not be wise to use the paz of ideas 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:07.120
 to all 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.320
 and in fact the tools to be touched after on absurd potash it's simple as 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.599
 it does not work 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.520
 directly with the successful breakthrough alas the size that one increases a small 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.069
 little 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.840
 so do not forget to put an object for 100 m 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.289
 in the focus of the camera here 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.939
 and so for this tutorial on matray points anyway so I hope 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.339
 that you liked 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.779
 you learned a lot of things and when the next abdallahi
