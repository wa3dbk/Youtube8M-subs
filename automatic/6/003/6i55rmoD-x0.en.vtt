00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.309
 in the evening 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.689
 talk there guys youtube 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 Who is speaking is maykon june and today 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.310
 is making you a video of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.560
 experience and experience 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.310
 Today the experience as you already can 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 come in the title of the video is how to do 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 a mini electric motor a prototype of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.320
 an electric motor 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.539
 as you already there followed how to ride 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 an electric motor that was the parts 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.890
 I've been to you go around 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.990
 making this model will arrive here that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.330
 We're going to do that in this model. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 we will I explain to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.850
 you run it is putting yourself 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.450
 the image you needed to be from a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.720
 battery may be case rayovac battery 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.660
 do not know how to call you what 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.230
 battery 12 volt there works cool 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.780
 too much because we're going to need this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.560
 explanation and now your explanation goes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 yes 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 this here if you go look inside 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 of your electric trolleys inside the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.829
 your mother's tank and it sure is the same 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.900
 engine model 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.030
 only here is going to have a more 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 simplified operation 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.989
 Now let's explain how you're going to call 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 for it to work this way already 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.290
 here we already put our magnet here 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 down 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.049
 here the coil will play the role of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.120
 coil and here is one of the most 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.359
 of any electric motor 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.200
 that exists today that is the 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.170
 transformer this is going to transform 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.959
 the electrical energy in impulse data 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 she is electromagnetic pulse is 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.750
 coming into contact with magnetism 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.730
 then generating a rotation both 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.739
 sides you're going to give a break wanted to give a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.540
 stride interest in this side here it 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.130
 Are you going to keep turning this way for you? 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.150
 on this fifth other side will continue 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.670
 generating staff 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.340
 Now we go to what matters 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.100
 really you, for example, will take the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.170
 the battery a positive wire 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:26.160
 I did not pass the inspection on the wood 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.080
 and here you will parade it in one of the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.640
 business tips it can 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.360
 reach the two sides does not have 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.910
 importance 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.890
 provided he is on the left side or 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.640
 right and not have so much importance to 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.690
 side 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.180
 You will catch the other end of the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.180
 the daughter will also pass through 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.470
 inside the wood and will place the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.470
 other side so that the wires 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.510
 go through them that way only here. 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.400
 that on the other side that foot is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.290
 happening you will be putting 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.800
 positive charges and negative charges in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.290
 Your engine is going to happen. 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.820
 the rotation logically but for this you 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.650
 do not even have to take a little 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.680
 pushes stipulated to rotate the film in 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.890
 June turning the pec is making the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.640
 and then comes generating your engine 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.280
 making your engine work is working 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.790
 This engine can be converted to me. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.060
 I do not know if you want to use 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.630
 just kidding 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.810
 It's anything, this can also be 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.590
 of a generator if you have a 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.680
 propeller puts the propeller right here 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.870
 for the best in the world but this school with 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.020
 This one if you throw an event here. 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.660
 already doing the circuit in reverse 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.660
 is turning a mini power generator 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.330
 Let's go back here but then this is it 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.789
 even right staff wanted to move to 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.840
 you as if making the motor 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.729
 electric 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.129
 I would also like to thank my 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.449
 friend joel mariano and my friend too 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:10.639
 Mariano izaquiel that they gave me the 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.069
 my article 20 was the request of me 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.740
 they said some things with 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.479
 relation to it that I could change or 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.550
 explain better to you 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.539
 I really enjoyed their help, I'm going back to 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.789
 to thank 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.099
 I would like to play the name in the mud of 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.490
 Guilherme who only enters my channel stays 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.020
 Landa pro channel and the UE reads channel elects 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.020
 Mulambo, I'm going to ask you to 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.099
 understand in the delicate channel 'saw only feel 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.750
 Shame and that's it folks it is that if you 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.449
 liked the video click the Like button

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.569
 idiots and html is thank you and even 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.569
 a next time he spoke and even more
