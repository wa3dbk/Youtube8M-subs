00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's not difficult to go back to the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's not difficult to go back to the
routine<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.000> difficult<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.630> take<00:02:26.620> this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
routine but it's difficult to take this

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.830 
routine but it's difficult to take this
and<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.630> process<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.950> know<00:02:29.980> it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and to just process it and you know it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.350 
and to just process it and you know it
happens<00:02:31.840> really<00:02:32.170> fast<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.090> four

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
happens really fast and it's like four

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.910 
happens really fast and it's like four
seconds<00:02:34.750> you're<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:34.960> there<00:02:35.170> kicking<00:02:35.650> ball

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
seconds you're out there kicking ball

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.240 
seconds you're out there kicking ball
and<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:38.050> hope<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.530> hope<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> go<00:02:39.100> in

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
and it's just hard the process to go

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.700 
and it's just hard the process to go
with<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> team<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.050> do<00:02:44.200> what<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.380> do<00:02:44.530> it's
