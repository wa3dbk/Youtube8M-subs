00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 versus sniper but little 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.599
 modified version because 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 now we will have four teams and even 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.300
 does not mean 4 teams will come out of it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.579
 armored vehicles and hydra tanks 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.790
 see the people themselves as scattered 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.410
 someone on the tanks for some reason I have lpg 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 and honestly velcro here and apparently 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.750
 here something is planned tough because 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.000
 what the guys go on the tanks he guys 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 with flies on airplanes and as usual 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 Naturally I will cut the most interesting and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.090
 the best moments so see you next 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:08.479

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.479
 and flew near her to her 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 it was epic and so here it is my first 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 the murder here is some kind of tin 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.530
 going on tanks on cars on 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.220
 airplanes are you guys trying to survive not 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 I am sure that the tank will come here 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.650
 it was very beautiful and here we are 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.049

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.449
 card and did not have time to do anything there was

 many people but also many teams 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.880
 so the card itself is actually she 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.160
 lasted minutes and 3 probably but it was 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.570
