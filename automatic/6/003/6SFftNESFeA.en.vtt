 I am a minor who was Christmas choreographer dancer performer 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.770
 what we can 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.009

 we are there some tax clothes 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.369
 reflect 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.220
 think about what for 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.349
 a creative project between us two 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380
 ap 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.050

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.300
 nothing 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.400
 then paris pp 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.770
 in the opinion of all areas it's called 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.010
 and even 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.130
 this is not the usual watch 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.140
 I am comedian clarence to authors I find a little in the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.630
 theater in parallel with the technique and I think it's one of 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.360
 things that have broken have made our counter a score but more or 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 less a little more discipline the current transition the people who the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.060
 regards the Azerbaijanis convince practice in touch a bit at all for 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.160
 that it is the staging with the interpretation worse to manufacture 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.140
 projects is out of the short this energetic side common to both 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.910
 a flash an active member of a hot spot 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.650
 have crossed on the plateau at least why try to do something 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.130
 thing that may be something that belongs to us both by 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.730
 against your energy what can we share on the plateau laurent 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.450
 Gbagbo 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 of theater and body dance other titles end suspense especially 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.430
 especially movement 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.080
 of purpose of the movement 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.119
 we will eventually leave a card 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.119
 a run applied his victim 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 the word the story on tuesday 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.830
 it's like that 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 you are mobile 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.220
 2 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.020
 Where is the problem 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.280
 okay 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.180
 but I come from the criticism in the shanxi yens on wednesday she is born m 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.340
 monday 20 in mali 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 diploma 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.509
 8 hours 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.059
 as to 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.080
 you go back and forth between paris and brazzaville 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.850
 Well it's complicated because before I decided to stay in Brazzaville 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.290
 clearly I told him to stay in France ensuring that the most practical 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.790
 sexy back to the base of the testimonies of these artists in France 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 matter is dead decided to close later that's it 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.590
 complicated apa on the spot by the way I draw a line on place 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.810
 I prefer to say I am between the two opponents of the head like that it is 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.629
 as well as I'm quite confusing like what the fox project and on the 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.329
 titles first ahmad had during visits to do this thing there on the 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.359
 plateau but m not yet title for accounts m because it was not so 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.469
 important m at the start any quick agreement what drives sharing on 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:05.589
 the talk board 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.999
 I believe the title came late cobra 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.219
 I do not know if the agreement is growing 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.859
 3 80 euros the most titled of much later and I think I had 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.499
 the title before since other experts the trophy of history gilles title 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.579
 because because at Madame Noël the series 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.689
 that's how the keys like oil nabucco felt I'm starting to find 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.650
 the few words that 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 and after 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.400
 always click click thinking that made it so that I could develop the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 text the art and thought of this work to make the idea of ​​the audiard he had 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.099
 had to shift traveler he had said it was the course of December 2 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.150
 in the yahia-bey world the idea that what to say the coronel is related to 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.640
 even more expression to a bulimia of things like me with the boiling 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.620
 a bulimia of words 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.650
 so obviously 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.659
 it's as if at the same time we will look at people making the boss 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.030
 text an introspection into the person so that can allow at the same time 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.579
 we will have to pay 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.989
 write but there may be some fables and that does not take account of fable 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.909
 I hold much more than in March a musicality of the words 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.900
 as the surprise could be understood 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.580
 no matter he will reward something easy happens especially that 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.950
 sierre 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.170
 from far away and at a few as high salaries two of the festivals get 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.370
 to cross it is frowned optier I heard and I read this news I saw 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.379
 this tax 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.199
 staging 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.229
 people understood these attacks it was well captured by 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.230
 as he is following 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.210
 of the two men from my latest creation called recipes 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.349
 so I had to come the go 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.449
 the characters in this play and create a kind of dramaturgy stopped 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.840
 there are characters charpy kiki was doing 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.469
 the story of these piece I think 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.689
 and to start her work we spent a short week working 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.899
 between 100 places was very very good that I was very surprised to see 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.659
 what treatment he could go so fast that we spent a week in 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.199
 work to explain to him the choices 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.310
 to introduce the dancers to tell him the stories of each of the 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.960
 characters from there to do a workshop with the dancers and he forgets 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.789
 alarcon gave to the common maul to find the characters he 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.210
 belongs he created the characters 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.400
 cottereau with the realities aside and on stage the fedis troops 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.750
 from there we realized for six months last remains the attacked however 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.860
 available 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.440
 of two what I wanted what I told through the room 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.560
 and from there I felt immediately that 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.979
 both in the sense that it may be much more 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.880
 interesting than to bring others 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.610
 our opponent our interpreter in bellac does that 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.319
 we did not know each other very well 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.270
 gone to berlin the potential is a little bit impatient of my head 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.680
 in order to do you have the mans it is not something that concerns us 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.360
 she for him for others 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.400
 the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.510
 travel no unpaid taxes through that test from the back a few 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:06.330
 month 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.210
 the gays but just aim to listen to them if we did it 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.189
 and if we did some schools 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:17.110
 m but yes why not 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.219
 when is that the most complicated 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:20.360
 it's a little there 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.039
 try to find a moment of a gunshot in the foot 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.989
 like that at the sight of the editors and against the advice of the prosecutor's office or whatever 

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.840
 it's super long 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.360
 I beg you 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.240

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.719

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.070

 risk of populism
