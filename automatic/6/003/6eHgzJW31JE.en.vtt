00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
windshield and wiper blades what I have

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.519 
windshield and wiper blades what I have
here<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.990> de-icer

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
here is a can of de-icer

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.450 
here is a can of de-icer
as<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:21.050> what<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.199> used<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:23.220> has

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
as you can see what it's used for it has

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.810 
as you can see what it's used for it has
an<00:00:23.970> alcohol-based<00:00:24.980> solvent<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
an alcohol-based solvent in it the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.410 
an alcohol-based solvent in it the
alcohol<00:00:27.029> will<00:00:28.670> decrease<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.000> freezing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
alcohol will decrease the freezing

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.970 
alcohol will decrease the freezing
temperature<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> water<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.740> mix

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
temperature of water as they mix

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
temperature of water as they mix
together<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.969> that'll<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.600> liquefy<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
together what that'll do is liquefy it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
together what that'll do is liquefy it
and<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.700> windshield<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.239> be

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and make it so your windshield will be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.240 
and make it so your windshield will be
clear<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.320> wiper<00:00:37.500> blades<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:37.950> begin

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
clear and your wiper blades will begin

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.940 
clear and your wiper blades will begin
functioning<00:00:38.820> properly<00:00:39.440> your<00:00:40.440> wiper<00:00:40.620> blades

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
functioning properly your wiper blades

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
functioning properly your wiper blades
are<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.520> pretty<00:00:41.940> complex<00:00:42.300> mechanism

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
are actually a pretty complex mechanism

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
are actually a pretty complex mechanism
they<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> whole<00:00:43.920> bunch<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.280> moving<00:00:44.670> parts

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
they have a whole bunch of moving parts

they have a whole bunch of moving parts
and<00:00:45.239> springs<00:00:45.719> inside<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> hold

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and springs inside of them that hold

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819
