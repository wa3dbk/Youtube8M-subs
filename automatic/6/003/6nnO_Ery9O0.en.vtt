00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello everyone on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 explain how a receiver is installed 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.580
 external in a door in a motor of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.380
 garage door 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.040
 the receiver that we are going to use is a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 receiver that is fed to 220 and 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.140
 supports all code commands 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.529
 evolutionary running back 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.480
 between those commands we have these two of 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.910
 here of the puyol brand 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.080
 the pujol ocean 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.650
 the pct pct myth the myth 2 this is the 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.320
 new model 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:51.730
 You send copiones the ferocious wolf 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.710
 of the clothing brand jcm motor line 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.649
 nice that of a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.050
 you have the milo of all these commands 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.360
 we can memorize perfectly in 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.699
 our receiver 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.030
 I have made a small installation here 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.430
 receiver station some light bulbs that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.580
 they will simulate the opening and closing of 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.070
 our engine and then the box 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.070
 maneuvers that goes connected to the engine 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.770
 to do the installation is very 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.420
 simple we have the first thing to have to 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.009
 we have to do is see if our 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.380
 box has a one option to put 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.280
 an alternative pushbutton as we can see 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.209
 Here it puts pe al lte alternative pulsator 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.159
 here you can put a button for 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.390
 instead of opening with the remote control 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.780
 with our push button 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 we are going to use this to put 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:58.030
 our external receiver and then then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.930
 we have to see that we have 220 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.240
 for feeding the receiver what 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.460
 first thing we will do is pull the cable 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 of feeding our receiver 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.620
 and as you can see, he is already fed 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.770
 and then on the relay output 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.460
 the output of l 1 as we take it 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.380
 our alternative button of the frame 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.260
 and with this we would have all the 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.050
 installation made now only us 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.880
 you would memorize the controls for 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.190
 memorizing it is very simple only 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.450
 we have to press once 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.700
 the receiver button will light up a 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.050
 little light 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.690
 and then press the button command 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.569
 you can see it stays fixed it had already been 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.129
 memorized 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.129
 let's do a test of 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.510
 working so you can see that 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.409
 Works perfectly 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.409
 as you can see 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.610
 when we press 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.540
 the motor 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.290
 makes the opening 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.530
 and the closure of it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.860
 I hope that everything became clear if 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.600
 you have any questions you can leave it in 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 the comments and will continue to respond
