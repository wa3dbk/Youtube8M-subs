and also the micro SD card slot so this

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.180 
and also the micro SD card slot so this
has<00:01:54.390> been<00:01:54.630> lacking<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:55.380> other<00:01:55.650> flagships

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
has been lacking in other flagships

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.910 
has been lacking in other flagships
recently<00:01:56.730> but<00:01:56.940> LG<00:01:57.210> has<00:01:57.570> stuck<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.230> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
recently but LG has stuck to the this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.860 
recently but LG has stuck to the this
formula<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.670> changed<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.120> actually

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
formula which they changed to actually

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.920 
formula which they changed to actually
during<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.680> g3<00:02:02.070> cycle<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.659> single

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
during the g3 cycle so that's the single

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.620 
during the g3 cycle so that's the single
sim<00:02:04.320> variant<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.610> g4<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.210> saw<00:02:06.390> now

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
sim variant of the g4 that you saw now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.020 
sim variant of the g4 that you saw now
we<00:02:06.690> are<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.080> unbox<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.970> show<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
we are going to unbox this and show you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.619 
we are going to unbox this and show you
the<00:02:09.840> dual<00:02:10.080> sim<00:02:10.349> variant<00:02:10.940> which<00:02:11.940> as<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.480> can

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the dual sim variant which as you can

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.990 
the dual sim variant which as you can
see<00:02:12.810> has<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.050> glossy<00:02:13.440> ceramic<00:02:14.250> finish<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
see has a glossy ceramic finish at the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.839 
see has a glossy ceramic finish at the
back<00:02:15.379> it's<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.739> nice<00:02:16.860> design<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.730> be

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
back it's a really nice design to be

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.600 
back it's a really nice design to be
honnest<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.500> really<00:02:19.650> flashy<00:02:20.010> compared

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
honnest but it is really flashy compared

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.570 
honnest but it is really flashy compared
to<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.909> sophisticated<00:02:21.860> leather<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.430> can

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
to the sophisticated leather one you can

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.880 
to the sophisticated leather one you can
see<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.879> difference<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
see the difference here this is the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.610 
see the difference here this is the
leather<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.549> plastic<00:02:27.299> pack<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.840> this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
leather one on a plastic pack and this

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.059 
leather one on a plastic pack and this
is<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> glossy<00:02:29.599> white<00:02:30.599> one<00:02:30.959> which<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.830> very

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
is the glossy white one which is very

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.789 
is the glossy white one which is very
hard<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.430> see<00:02:32.549> on<00:02:32.580> camera<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.150> sure<00:02:33.560> I'm<00:02:34.560> going

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
hard to see on camera I'm sure I'm going

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.110 
hard to see on camera I'm sure I'm going
to<00:02:34.860> remove<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:36.150> white<00:02:37.019> one<00:02:37.290> these<00:02:37.500> are

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
to remove the white one these are

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.239 
to remove the white one these are
exchangeable<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.359> course<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.109> much<00:02:41.010> more

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:41.249 
exchangeable of course this is much more

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.460 
exchangeable of course this is much more
harder<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.109> less

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
harder and less

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.570 
harder and less
bendable<00:02:44.120> than<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.570> leather<00:02:46.260> variant<00:02:46.770> but<00:02:47.430> of

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
bendable than the leather variant but of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.760 
bendable than the leather variant but of
course<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> feel<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.570> entirely<00:02:49.530> different

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
course the feel is entirely different

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.220 
course the feel is entirely different
the<00:02:50.460> leather<00:02:50.670> has<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.330> leather<00:02:51.600> filled<00:02:51.960> with

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the leather has a leather filled with

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.570 
the leather has a leather filled with
stitching's<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.460> but<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:54.240> has<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
stitching's and so on but this has a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.300 
stitching's and so on but this has a
diamond-shaped<00:02:56.580> feel<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:58.530> has<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:59.280> know

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
diamond-shaped feel it has you know

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.470 
diamond-shaped feel it has you know
crests<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.210> troughs<00:03:01.100> but<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.520> glossy<00:03:02.820> so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
crests and troughs but it is glossy so

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.680 
crests and troughs but it is glossy so
it<00:03:03.630> might<00:03:04.110> get<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.590> lot<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.980> scratches<00:03:05.460> but<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
it might get a lot of scratches but that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.100 
it might get a lot of scratches but that

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
on top of the phone but it's a

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.580 
on top of the phone but it's a
fingerprint<00:03:39.240> magnet<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:39.720> not<00:03:40.020> sure<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.380> it's

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
fingerprint magnet I'm not sure if it's

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.520 
fingerprint magnet I'm not sure if it's
a<00:03:40.709> scratch<00:03:41.040> card<00:03:41.310> or<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:42.150> protection<00:03:43.080> cover

a scratch card or just protection cover

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.300 
a scratch card or just protection cover
remove<00:03:44.459> all<00:03:44.730> these<00:03:45.440> protection<00:03:46.440> covers<00:03:46.890> and

remove all these protection covers and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.729 
remove all these protection covers and
in<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.180> meantime<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> phone's<00:03:49.170> booting

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
in the meantime in the phone's booting

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.040 
in the meantime in the phone's booting
let's<00:03:50.610> take<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> look<00:03:51.209> at<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.360> box<00:03:51.570> contents

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
let's take a look at the box contents

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.580 
let's take a look at the box contents
anyway

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
anyway

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.320 
anyway
let's<00:03:53.040> see<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:53.550> anything<00:03:53.820> different

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
let's see if there's anything different

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.910 
let's see if there's anything different
so<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.700> got<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.390> same<00:03:57.600> 3000<00:03:58.230> mAh<00:03:58.470> battery

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
so you got the same 3000 mAh battery

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.430 
so you got the same 3000 mAh battery
inside<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.820> no<00:04:00.450> additional<00:04:00.690> capacity

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
inside there is no additional capacity

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.280 
inside there is no additional capacity
for<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.130> dual<00:04:02.280> SIM<00:04:02.519> version<00:04:02.780> but<00:04:03.780> there<00:04:04.110> might

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
for the dual SIM version but there might

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.270 
for the dual SIM version but there might
be<00:04:04.350> more<00:04:04.590> badly<00:04:05.220> sip<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.780> this<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.959> white

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
be more badly sip and this the white

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.160 
be more badly sip and this the white
microUSB<00:04:08.280> cable<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.820> this<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.690> two<00:04:09.930> pin

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
microUSB cable and this is the two pin

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.610 
microUSB cable and this is the two pin
plug<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:11.190> get<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.580> USB<00:04:11.790> travel<00:04:12.330> charger

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
plug that you get the USB travel charger

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.130
