strawberries which I didn't know you
could<00:00:48.480> ever<00:00:48.960> occur<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> giving

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
could ever occur but it's kind of giving

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
could ever occur but it's kind of giving

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
middle of their research to the moments

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
middle of their research to the moments
they<00:00:59.579> could<00:00:59.730> say<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.390> yeah<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.930> haven't

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
they could say well yeah we haven't

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
they could say well yeah we haven't
solved<00:01:01.770> cancer<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.460> we're<00:01:03.030> working<00:01:03.270> towards

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
solved cancer but we're working towards

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.640 
solved cancer but we're working towards
that<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:03.960> we're<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.470> there

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that and we're gonna get there

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
that and we're gonna get there
eventually<00:01:04.850> asking<00:01:05.850> loads<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.299> questions

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
eventually asking loads of questions

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
eventually asking loads of questions
that<00:01:06.780> everybody<00:01:07.110> happens<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.950> didn't<00:01:08.250> know

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that everybody happens I didn't know

it<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.179> now<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.390> think<00:01:52.539> it's<00:01:52.840> much<00:01:53.020> more

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
it but now I think it's much more

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
into it as like a possible path when I

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.539 
into it as like a possible path when I
meant<00:01:58.240> nothing<00:01:58.929> for<00:01:59.679> me<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.009> coolest<00:02:00.159> thing

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549
