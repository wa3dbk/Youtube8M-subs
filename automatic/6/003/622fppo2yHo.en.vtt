00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I would like to show you something

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.810 
I would like to show you something
really<00:00:12.990> cool<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> SPL

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
really cool that you can do with the SPL

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.420 
really cool that you can do with the SPL
drum<00:00:15.059> exchanger<00:00:15.660> plug-in<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:17.250> just

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
drum exchanger plug-in I was just

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.040 
drum exchanger plug-in I was just
recently<00:00:17.610> in<00:00:17.850> need<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> snare<00:00:18.539> drum<00:00:18.570> track

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
recently in need of a snare drum track

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.750 
recently in need of a snare drum track
and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> couldn't<00:00:19.650> record<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.039> live<00:00:20.310> because<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and I couldn't record it live because I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.100 
and I couldn't record it live because I
didn't<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> snare<00:00:21.510> drum<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.960> was

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
didn't have a snare drum and I was

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.109 
didn't have a snare drum and I was
sitting<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.440> a<00:00:22.500> small<00:00:22.650> project<00:00:22.980> studio<00:00:23.520> so

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
sitting in a small project studio so

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
sitting in a small project studio so
here's<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> did<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.960> took<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> practice<00:00:25.680> pad

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here's what I did I took a practice pad

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.070 
here's what I did I took a practice pad
and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> recorded<00:00:27.119> myself<00:00:27.300> playing<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and I recorded myself playing that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.189 
and I recorded myself playing that
pattern<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.710> pad<00:00:33.679> and<00:00:35.659> then<00:00:36.659> I<00:00:36.690> loaded<00:00:37.019> it

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
pattern on that pad and then I loaded it

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.489 
pattern on that pad and then I loaded it
up<00:00:37.350> into<00:00:37.649> Pro<00:00:37.829> Tools<00:00:37.859> I<00:00:38.870> then<00:00:39.870> assigned<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:40.499 
up into Pro Tools I then assigned the

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.819 
up into Pro Tools I then assigned the
SPL<00:00:40.920> drum<00:00:41.129> exchanger<00:00:41.609> plug-in<00:00:41.999> to<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> track

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
SPL drum exchanger plug-in to that track

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.289 
SPL drum exchanger plug-in to that track
so<00:00:43.829> here's<00:00:44.039> the<00:00:44.219> track<00:00:44.429> again<00:00:44.729> just<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.179> I

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
so here's the track again just as I

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:54.100 
so here's the track again just as I
recorded<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.230 

and<00:00:54.200> then<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:55.040> just<00:00:55.220> started<00:00:55.580> replacing<00:00:56.120> it

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
and then I just started replacing it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.630 
and then I just started replacing it
with<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.540> SPL<00:00:56.900> drum<00:00:57.080> exchanger<00:00:57.650> in<00:00:57.860> order<00:00:58.520> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
with the SPL drum exchanger in order to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.550 
with the SPL drum exchanger in order to
hear<00:00:58.970> what<00:00:59.120> my<00:00:59.270> trigger<00:00:59.540> signal<00:00:59.990> was<00:01:00.110> like<00:01:00.350> I

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
hear what my trigger signal was like I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.970 
hear what my trigger signal was like I
soloed<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.460> trigger<00:01:01.700> section<00:01:02.620> then<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.650> pushed

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
soloed the trigger section then I pushed

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.650 
soloed the trigger section then I pushed
the<00:01:04.160> transient<00:01:04.640> gain<00:01:04.879> for<00:01:05.210> best<00:01:05.420> results<00:01:10.660> and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
the transient gain for best results and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.400 
the transient gain for best results and
then<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.110> adjusted<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.740> trigger<00:01:13.010> gain<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:17.410> then

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
then I adjusted to trigger gain and then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.950 
then I adjusted to trigger gain and then
all<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:18.650> had<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.070> do<00:01:19.250> was<00:01:19.850> unsolo<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.720> trigger

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
all I had to do was unsolo the trigger

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.430 
all I had to do was unsolo the trigger
section<00:01:22.510> now<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.570> have<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> trigger<00:01:24.050> already

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
section now you have a trigger already

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.960 
section now you have a trigger already
and<00:01:24.680> then<00:01:24.950> adjust<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> trigger<00:01:25.670> sensitivity

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
and then adjust the trigger sensitivity

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.290 
and then adjust the trigger sensitivity
with<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> green<00:01:27.080> arrows<00:01:27.490> if<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:28.700> both<00:01:28.910> blink

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
with the green arrows if they both blink

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.910 
with the green arrows if they both blink
together<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:30.050> means<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.440> sample<00:01:30.800> is

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
together that means a sample is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
together that means a sample is
triggered<00:01:36.100> then<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.130> listen<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.850> original

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
triggered then I listen to the original

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.580 
triggered then I listen to the original
signal<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:40.690> since<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.840> don't<00:01:41.899> actually<00:01:42.290> want

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
signal and since I don't actually want

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.530 
signal and since I don't actually want
to<00:01:42.710> use<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.130> original<00:01:43.610> signal<00:01:43.910> at<00:01:44.060> all<00:01:44.090> I

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
to use that original signal at all I

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:54.760 
to use that original signal at all I
switch<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.320> dry/wet<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:46.040> all<00:01:46.220> wet<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.619> have

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
switch the dry/wet to all wet so I have

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:07.520 
switch the dry/wet to all wet so I have
a<00:01:54.800> look<00:01:55.040> what<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> ended<00:01:55.610> up<00:01:55.729> with

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.660 

if<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.770> want<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.009> check<00:02:09.190> out<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.490> drum

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
if you want to check out the drum

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.460 
if you want to check out the drum
