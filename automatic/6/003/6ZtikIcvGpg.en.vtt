00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.770 
partnership I think it's great it is
exactly<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.700> needs<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.120> be<00:00:24.210> done<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.600> think

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
exactly what needs to be done I think

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.360 
exactly what needs to be done I think
those<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.110> going<00:00:25.290> to<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.500> man<00:00:26.130> to

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
those two are going to really man to

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.640 
those two are going to really man to
life<00:00:26.640> products<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.600> bring<00:00:28.110> a<00:00:28.200> lot<00:00:28.350> of<00:00:28.380> group

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
life products and bring a lot of group

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.260 
life products and bring a lot of group
together<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.460> commonality<00:00:30.120> so<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
together with some commonality so I

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.490 
together with some commonality so I
think<00:00:30.390> you'll<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:30.810> good<00:00:30.900> synergy<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
think you'll have some good synergy for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
think you'll have some good synergy for
that<00:00:31.619> truly<00:00:32.039> there's<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.550> much<00:00:32.759> overlap<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that truly there's so much overlap in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
that truly there's so much overlap in
those<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.230> shows<00:00:34.559> both<00:00:35.100> audiences<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:36.059> very

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
those two shows both audiences are very

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.940 
those two shows both audiences are very
important<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.900> us<00:00:37.020> why<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.710> bring<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
important to us why not bring it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
important to us why not bring it
together<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.880> increase<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.810> energy

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
together and just increase that energy

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.710 
together and just increase that energy
and<00:00:40.890> intensity<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.970> everybody<00:00:42.360> gets<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
and intensity so that everybody gets a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.270 
and intensity so that everybody gets a
lot<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:42.930> excited<00:00:43.500> everybody's<00:00:44.010> excited

other items it's a great way to

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.440 
other items it's a great way to
consolidate<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.580> shows<00:01:18.790> i<00:01:19.060> think<00:01:19.270> you'll

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
consolidate the shows i think you'll

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.780 
consolidate the shows i think you'll
find<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:19.869> lots<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.920> people<00:01:20.979> who've<00:01:21.580> never

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
find that lots of people who've never

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.450 
find that lots of people who've never
been<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.300> one<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.810> other<00:01:22.840> will<00:01:23.259> find<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.340> lot

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
been to one of the other will find a lot

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.520 
been to one of the other will find a lot
of<00:01:24.490> great<00:01:24.759> information<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:26.080> know<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.380> to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
of great information you know going to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.230 
of great information you know going to
the<00:01:26.649> reciprocal<00:01:27.190> shows<00:01:27.369> combining<00:01:27.970> those

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the reciprocal shows combining those

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.340 
the reciprocal shows combining those
shows<00:01:28.539> I<00:01:28.750> think<00:01:28.929> it's<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.080> great<00:01:29.229> opportunity

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
shows I think it's a great opportunity

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.770 
shows I think it's a great opportunity
to<00:01:29.920> have<00:01:30.190> one<00:01:30.429> trout<00:01:30.759> look<00:01:30.970> event<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.539> get<00:01:31.690> to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
to have one trout look event to get to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.300 
to have one trout look event to get to
see<00:01:31.929> everything<00:01:32.140> was<00:01:32.470> fun<00:01:32.740> we're<00:01:32.979> hoping<00:01:33.190> to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
see everything was fun we're hoping to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.950 
see everything was fun we're hoping to
send<00:01:33.520> more<00:01:33.700> people<00:01:33.940> because<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.600> will<00:01:34.810> be

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
send more people because it will be

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.719 
send more people because it will be
combined<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.890> we<00:01:36.009> can<00:01:36.160> kind<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.490> combine

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
combined and we can kind of combine

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.419 
combined and we can kind of combine
those<00:01:37.030> traveling<00:01:37.539> expenses<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.100> it'll<00:01:39.280> be<00:01:39.340> in

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
those traveling expenses and it'll be in

those traveling expenses and it'll be in
a<00:01:39.520> fun<00:01:39.670> place<00:01:39.880> Vegas<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.869> think<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.470> should

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
a fun place Vegas so I think it should
