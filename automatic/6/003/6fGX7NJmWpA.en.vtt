00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and there's starting another flight revenue 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.970
 Summer, we're going to make it more accepted today. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.350
 super easy practice for you to do 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:18.869
 any time of your day we'll go 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:23.240
 make one of the texas to start right here 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 60 grams of fresh mines cheese 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.510
 put here are more or less three 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.830
 slices 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 here I have a teaspoon of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 olive oil and to give all the touch 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.610
 special in our recipe I'm going to put 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.390
 here our favor of cheese with tomato 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.390
 and basil 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.770
 but now it's just the act of making a briefcase 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.870
 I'll pass the cheese pastry with 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.399
 flight on my loaves 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.399
 so beautifully 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.070
 that amount to give two sandwiches 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 so it will get quite filling in your 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.009
 tech without miserÃª reinventa of dividing by 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.540
 three do not do a thing like that to full 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:27.550
 full of life full of happiness 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.789
 I'll close here my sandwiches 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.580
 tostex and I'll pass butter 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.660
 on the outside of the sandwich to give 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.789
 all the golden touch on the outside 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.700
 I'm going to put our technicians in 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:47.530
 This way, the sandwich 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.509
 is with the butter down what I 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.509
 I came here and I'll add more butter 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.310
 if you do not have a sandwich maker 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.750
 You can use these from here are more 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 maybe you have one at home 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.390
 You can also make it normal, it's just you. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.179
 pass butter as we talked 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.110
 normal third you put that three minutes 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.110
 on each side over low heat or until golden brown 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.890
 the ex 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.580

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.519

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.459

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.180
