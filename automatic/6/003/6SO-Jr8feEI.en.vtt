I'm not gonna risk breaking another one
of<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.430> keys<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.270> this<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.570> work<00:03:33.680> so

Morphin<00:03:37.260> black<00:03:37.770> Ranger<00:03:38.190> key<00:03:38.810> I'm<00:03:39.810> stuck<00:03:40.590> with

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
Morphin black Ranger key I'm stuck with

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.970 
Morphin black Ranger key I'm stuck with
it<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.130> why<00:03:41.820> not

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.140 

come<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.160> darn<00:03:50.670> it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:16.820 

finally<00:04:03.440> well<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.620> sounds<00:04:04.980> familiar<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.799> I

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
finally well that sounds familiar so I

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.009 
finally well that sounds familiar so I
almost<00:04:17.310> broke<00:04:17.730> one<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.090> my<00:04:18.299> keys

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
almost broke one of my keys

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.110 
almost broke one of my keys
just<00:04:19.290> for<00:04:19.440> some<00:04:19.530> average<00:04:19.979> lackluster<00:04:20.700> sound

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.129 

okay<00:04:27.120> maybe<00:04:27.389> they're<00:04:27.629> not<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:27.810> bad

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
okay maybe they're not that bad

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.839 
okay maybe they're not that bad
so<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.289> overall<00:04:31.710> look<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.129> the<00:04:32.190> cannon<00:04:32.639> is

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
so the overall look of the cannon is

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.480 
so the overall look of the cannon is
very<00:04:33.120> nice<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:34.199> paint<00:04:34.470> job<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.919> details<00:04:35.310> are

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
very nice the paint job and details are

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.089 
very nice the paint job and details are
great<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.479> looks<00:04:36.509> just<00:04:36.840> as<00:04:37.169> good<00:04:37.409> as<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.770> sky

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
great and it looks just as good as a sky

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.460 
great and it looks just as good as a sky
ship<00:04:38.340> does<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:39.449> not<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.810> best<00:04:39.990> toy<00:04:40.229> in<00:04:40.379> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
ship does it's not the best toy in the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.100 
ship does it's not the best toy in the
world<00:04:40.680> due<00:04:41.009> to<00:04:41.190> all<00:04:41.310> its<00:04:41.460> flaws<00:04:41.699> but<00:04:42.120> it's

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
world due to all its flaws but it's

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.619 
world due to all its flaws but it's
better<00:04:43.349> than<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.770> super<00:04:44.129> mega<00:04:44.370> blaster<00:04:44.940> not

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
better than the super mega blaster not

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.839 
better than the super mega blaster not
by<00:04:45.840> much<00:04:46.080> though<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.620> would<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.520> preferred

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
by much though I would have preferred

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.820 
by much though I would have preferred
the<00:04:47.970> key<00:04:48.150> slot<00:04:48.419> for<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> deluxe<00:04:49.169> sounds<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.800> be

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
the key slot for the deluxe sounds to be

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.890 
the key slot for the deluxe sounds to be
a<00:04:49.979> bit<00:04:50.220> wider<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:51.240> key<00:04:51.419> could<00:04:51.629> slide<00:04:51.870> right

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
a bit wider so the key could slide right

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.140 
a bit wider so the key could slide right
in<00:04:52.349> if<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:53.220> would<00:04:53.370> have<00:04:53.460> tried<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.759> force<00:04:54.000> my

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
in if I would have tried to force my

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.869 
in if I would have tried to force my
other<00:04:54.360> key<00:04:54.599> inside<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.590> could<00:04:55.889> have<00:04:55.979> broke<00:04:56.250> so

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
other key inside it could have broke so

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.010

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
samurai Ranger which doesn't make much

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.320 
samurai Ranger which doesn't make much
sense<00:05:19.110> since<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:19.979> already<00:05:20.190> comes<00:05:20.490> in<00:05:20.759> a<00:05:20.849> wave<00:05:21.030> 1

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330
