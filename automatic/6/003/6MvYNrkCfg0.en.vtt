on 12 slightly warmed tortillas then if

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
on 12 slightly warmed tortillas then if

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
chips and then we're going to fold it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.330 
chips and then we're going to fold it
together<00:01:35.940> like<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> parcel<00:01:36.710> now<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> found<00:01:38.160> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
together like a parcel now I found the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
together like a parcel now I found the
best<00:01:38.520> method<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.390> folding<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
best method for this was folding in the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.620 
best method for this was folding in the
sides<00:01:40.400> then<00:01:41.400> simply<00:01:41.940> rolling<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
sides then simply rolling it up and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.670 
sides then simply rolling it up and
folding<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:49.470> we're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
folding over the top and then we're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.920 
folding over the top and then we're
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.830> secure<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.580> toothpick

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.300 

once<00:01:54.930> we've<00:01:55.110> tested<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.620> oil<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.100> sure

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
once we've tested the oil to make sure

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.620 
once we've tested the oil to make sure
it's<00:01:56.460> hot<00:01:56.640> enough<00:01:56.880> we're<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> add

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's hot enough we're then going to add

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.940 
it's hot enough we're then going to add
in<00:01:57.870> our<00:01:58.140> tortillas<00:02:00.260> if<00:02:01.260> you<00:02:01.410> find<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.800> they

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
in our tortillas if you find that they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.230 
in our tortillas if you find that they
won't<00:02:02.160> flip<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.610> due<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.090> weight

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
won't flip over due to the weight

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760 
won't flip over due to the weight
distribution<00:02:03.660> all<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.260> need<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.650> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
distribution all you need to do is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.700 
distribution all you need to do is
gently<00:02:05.070> hold<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> down<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> fork<00:02:06.710> then

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
gently hold it down with a fork then

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.690 
gently hold it down with a fork then
we're<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.070> cook<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.640> about

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
we're going to cook those for about

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
we're going to cook those for about
three<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.210> four<00:02:09.360> minutes<00:02:09.540> until<00:02:09.810> they're

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
golden brown and then all we need to do

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.960 
golden brown and then all we need to do
is<00:02:13.410> keep<00:02:13.590> repeating<00:02:13.920> until<00:02:14.250> they're<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.730> done
