because it blinks distinctly it brings
blinks<00:01:15.570> regularly<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.670> when<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
blinks regularly and when you see one of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
blinks regularly and when you see one of
these<00:01:18.390> objects<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.740> clear<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.189> an

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
these objects it is very clear from an

we've<00:02:39.100> heard<00:02:39.490> some<00:02:40.330> things<00:02:40.720> some<00:02:41.140> theories

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
we've heard some things some theories

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.940 
we've heard some things some theories
such<00:02:41.830> as<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.280> an<00:02:42.460> Iridium<00:02:42.940> flare<00:02:43.330> which<00:02:43.600> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
such as it's an Iridium flare which is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.830 
such as it's an Iridium flare which is
possibly<00:02:44.950> an<00:02:45.190> old<00:02:45.400> satellite<00:02:46.090> getting<00:02:46.570> light

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
possibly an old satellite getting light

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.810 
possibly an old satellite getting light
from<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.230> Sun<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.040> know<00:02:48.250> things<00:02:48.640> like

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
from the Sun but you know things like

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.120 
from the Sun but you know things like
that<00:02:48.880> aren't<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.959> show<00:02:49.990> up<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.560> exact

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that aren't going to show up the exact

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.940 
that aren't going to show up the exact
same<00:02:51.459> time<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.030> exact<00:02:52.420> same<00:02:52.690> spot<00:02:53.020> for<00:02:53.650> ten

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
same time the exact same spot for ten

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.040 
same time the exact same spot for ten
consecutive<00:02:54.190> nights<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.030> row<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.510> what<00:02:55.690> is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
consecutive nights in a row so what is

consecutive nights in a row so what is
it<00:02:56.170> show<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.640> well<00:02:57.640> last<00:02:58.180> night<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.540> showed<00:02:58.780> up

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it show up well last night it showed up

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.770 
it show up well last night it showed up
around<00:02:59.430> 7:14<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.640> first<00:03:00.850> sighting<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.420> then

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
around 7:14 the first sighting and then

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.000 
around 7:14 the first sighting and then
it<00:03:01.900> consecutively<00:03:02.560> showed<00:03:03.340> up<00:03:03.490> around<00:03:03.810> 7:25

it consecutively showed up around 7:25

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.490 
it consecutively showed up around 7:25
742<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.450> MUFON<00:03:07.840> investigator

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
742 and the MUFON investigator

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.949
