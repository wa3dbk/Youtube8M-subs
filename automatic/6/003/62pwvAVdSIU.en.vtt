00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
sketchy um but not too bad the only

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959

thing<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.309> place<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
thing I don't like about this place is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779 
thing I don't like about this place is
that<00:00:48.390> after<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> jump<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.309> got<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> swim<00:00:50.700> out

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that after you jump you got to swim out

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
that after you jump you got to swim out
to<00:00:50.969> those<00:00:51.059> rocks<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.649> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to those rocks out there and then you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.540 
to those rocks out there and then you
got<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.670> climb<00:00:53.969> across<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.329> bunch<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.690> boulders

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
got to climb across a bunch of boulders

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
got to climb across a bunch of boulders
up<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> big<00:00:56.879> hill<00:00:57.410> back<00:00:58.410> over<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> across<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
up a big hill back over it across the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
up a big hill back over it across the
road<00:00:59.550> down<00:00:59.879> across<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.510> alongside<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.350> road

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
road down across but alongside the road

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.880 
road down across but alongside the road
and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and then back down to get to what you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
and then back down to get to what you
jumped<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.880> mean<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> not<00:01:06.450> horrible

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
jumped off of I mean it's not horrible

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.830 
jumped off of I mean it's not horrible
but<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.310> best<00:01:08.610> setup<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.540> cliff

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but it's not the best setup for a cliff

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
but it's not the best setup for a cliff
jump<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:10.920> worth<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.400> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
jump but it's worth it because these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
jump but it's worth it because these
cliffs<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.450> big<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.310> through<00:01:14.400> there

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
cliffs are big so to get through there

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.679 
cliffs are big so to get through there
like<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> bigger<00:01:15.030> spots<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> take

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
like one of the bigger spots if you take

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.050 
like one of the bigger spots if you take
this<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:16.080> sketchy<00:01:16.890> path<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this little sketchy path that if you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.410 
this little sketchy path that if you
slipped<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.990> fell<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.320> die<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.299> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
slipped and fell you die and then this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
slipped and fell you die and then this
brings<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> locals<00:01:23.430> say
