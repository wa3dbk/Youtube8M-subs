00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
it's one of those rare occasions that I

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.889 
it's one of those rare occasions that I
come<00:00:45.970> across<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.360> Filipino<00:00:49.170> truck<00:00:50.170> drivers

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.979 

I<00:00:53.930> did<00:00:54.680> I<00:00:56.079> don't<00:00:57.079> know<00:00:57.940> somewhere<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.600> dozen

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
I did I don't know somewhere on a dozen

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.390 
I did I don't know somewhere on a dozen
encounters<00:01:00.890> over<00:01:01.640> 20<00:01:02.090> years<00:01:02.980> so<00:01:03.980> that's<00:01:04.190> not

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
encounters over 20 years so that's not

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:20.790 
encounters over 20 years so that's not
really<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.850> whole<00:01:05.089> lot

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.130 

I<00:01:20.860> don't<00:01:21.580> know<00:01:21.640> if<00:01:21.790> it's<00:01:21.970> I<00:01:22.270> think<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.840> me

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
I don't know if it's I think it just me

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.000 
I don't know if it's I think it just me
but

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.800 
but
I<00:01:25.070> think<00:01:25.790> most<00:01:26.000> Latinos<00:01:26.660> are<00:01:27.640> probably

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
I think most Latinos are probably

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
I think most Latinos are probably
homebodies<00:01:29.810> as<00:01:30.410> they<00:01:30.650> call

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
homebodies as they call

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.540 
homebodies as they call
they<00:01:33.000> don't<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.570> leave<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.290> house<00:01:34.950> too

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
they don't want to leave the house too

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.010 
they don't want to leave the house too
long

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.830 

the<00:01:42.470> Latinos<00:01:42.920> are<00:01:43.100> very<00:01:43.430> close<00:01:43.820> met<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.630> their

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the Latinos are very close met to their

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.539 
the Latinos are very close met to their
families<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.649> communities<00:01:47.079> so<00:01:48.079> most<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.950> them

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
families and communities so most of them

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.700 
families and communities so most of them
