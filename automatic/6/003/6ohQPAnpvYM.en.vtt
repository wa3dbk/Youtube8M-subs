case<00:00:16.470> van<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.760> man<00:00:18.240> uses<00:00:18.570> hydraulic

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
case van so this man uses hydraulic

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
case van so this man uses hydraulic
bearings<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.710> 120<00:00:20.430> millimeters<00:00:20.880> in

is boys stories around about 13 decibels
so<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.620> crack<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.980> open<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> top<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.840> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
so just crack and open the top here you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
so just crack and open the top here you
can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> fan<00:01:01.410> presented<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> top

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
can see the fan presented on the top

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.840 
can see the fan presented on the top
itself<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> pull<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
itself so just kind of pull that out and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.190 
itself so just kind of pull that out and
move<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.080> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
move it off to the side and then get on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.450 
move it off to the side and then get on
to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> accessories<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> come<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to the accessories that come in the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
to the accessories that come in the
packaging<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.729> comes<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.180> four<00:01:15.600> low<00:01:16.350> noise

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
packaging this comes with four low noise

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.280 
packaging this comes with four low noise
rubber<00:01:16.950> mounts<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> guess<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> call<00:01:18.150> them

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
rubber mounts I guess you call them

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
rubber mounts I guess you call them
they're<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.770> yeah<00:01:20.400> lower<00:01:20.640> noise

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
they're just for our yeah lower noise

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
they're just for our yeah lower noise
and<00:01:21.210> less<00:01:21.810> vibrations<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.220> transferred

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and less vibrations to be transferred

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
and less vibrations to be transferred
into<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:23.880> case<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.560> there

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
into your case so you can see them there

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.140 
into your case so you can see them there
it<00:01:25.860> comes<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.580> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.820> pop<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it comes for them just kind of pop and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.880 
it comes for them just kind of pop and
through<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.479> fan<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.110> push<00:01:28.799> them

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
through the fan and then push them

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
through the fan and then push them
through<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.189> case<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.030> mount<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
through the case so mount them so it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
through the case so mount them so it
comes<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.009> four<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.180> also<00:01:33.329> comes

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
comes with four of them it also comes

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.410 
comes with four of them it also comes
with<00:01:33.689> four<00:01:34.380> nice<00:01:34.619> black<00:01:35.490> screws<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
with four nice black screws as well and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.980 
with four nice black screws as well and
onto<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.600> case<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> say<00:01:42.150> including<00:01:42.659> black

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
onto your case now I say including black

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.570 
onto your case now I say including black
ones<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.680> crappy<00:01:44.399> old<00:01:44.430> silver<00:01:44.820> ones

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
ones not just crappy old silver ones

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.790 
ones not just crappy old silver ones
and<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.330> also<00:01:47.450> includes<00:01:47.930> obviously<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
and it also includes obviously the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.500 
and it also includes obviously the
low-noise<00:01:49.130> adapter<00:01:49.640> they're<00:01:49.790> nicely<00:01:50.060> sleeved

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
low-noise adapter they're nicely sleeved

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.100 
low-noise adapter they're nicely sleeved
can't<00:01:50.900> see<00:01:51.020> any<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.380> their<00:01:51.530> wires<00:01:52.960> fairly<00:01:53.960> nice

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
can't see any of their wires fairly nice

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.690 
can't see any of their wires fairly nice
as<00:01:54.620> I<00:01:54.770> say<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.070> brings<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.400> down<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.670> a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
as I say that brings it down to a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.150 
as I say that brings it down to a
maximum<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.120> eight<00:01:56.300> hundred<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.660> fifty<00:01:56.780> rpm

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
maximum of eight hundred and fifty rpm

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.370 
maximum of eight hundred and fifty rpm
so<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.220> can<00:01:58.340> see<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.520> fan<00:01:58.700> here<00:01:59.140> white<00:02:00.140> blades

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
so you can see the fan here white blades

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.410 
so you can see the fan here white blades
obviously<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.250> fractal<00:02:01.640> design<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:02.300> much

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
obviously the fractal design it's much

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.140 
obviously the fractal design it's much
their<00:02:02.630> products<00:02:02.900> are<00:02:03.050> in<00:02:03.170> white<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.790> see<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
their products are in white you see the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.960 
their products are in white you see the
specs<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.630> back<00:02:05.780> there<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.610> sleeve<00:02:07.850> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
specs on the back there the sleeve and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.690 
specs on the back there the sleeve and
on<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.119> cables<00:02:08.510> fairly<00:02:08.869> nice<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.740> can't<00:02:10.580> see

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
on the cables fairly nice you can't see

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.850 
on the cables fairly nice you can't see
any<00:02:10.850> otherwise<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.540> see<00:02:11.690> bit<00:02:12.650> if<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
any otherwise you can see bit if the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.530 
any otherwise you can see bit if the
wires<00:02:13.070> when<00:02:13.400> if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.700> bend<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> connector<00:02:14.390> but

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
wires when if you bend the connector but

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.090 
wires when if you bend the connector but
the<00:02:14.630> sleeve<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.020> itself<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.530> perfect<00:02:16.010> you
