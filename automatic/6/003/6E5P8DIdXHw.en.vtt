rah-rah more ECU to the car
the<00:00:16.039> program<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.160> use<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.520> called<00:00:17.699> ROM<00:00:17.970> Raider

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the program I use is called ROM Raider

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.420 
the program I use is called ROM Raider
and<00:00:18.890> it<00:00:20.810> allows<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> make<00:00:22.500> changes<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and it allows you to make changes to the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.380 
and it allows you to make changes to the
stock<00:00:24.090> ECU<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.779> also<00:00:25.640> while<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.789> driving

sure that we're doing so safely and all
of<00:00:42.629> these<00:00:44.360> logs<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.219> ROM<00:00:47.219> Raider

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
of these logs that we do in ROM Raider

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.170 
of these logs that we do in ROM Raider
already<00:00:48.090> saved<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.379> an<00:00:49.980> Excel<00:00:50.489> format<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:51.090> we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
already saved in an Excel format that we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270 
already saved in an Excel format that we
can<00:00:51.329> also<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:52.170> back<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> look<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
can also go back and look at just to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.799 
can also go back and look at just to
make<00:00:53.430> sure<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.640> didn't<00:00:53.820> miss<00:00:53.850> anything<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.549 

this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> how<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> looks<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.149> I<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.559> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this is how it looks and I have a just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
this is how it looks and I have a just
some<00:01:01.770> stock<00:01:02.010> maps<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:03.470> we'll<00:01:04.470> pull<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.650> one

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
some stock maps here we'll pull up one

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.950 
some stock maps here we'll pull up one
this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.880> stock<00:01:06.950> 2004<00:01:07.950> WRX<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.960> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
this is just for stock 2004 WRX and so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.359 
this is just for stock 2004 WRX and so
if<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.290> were<00:01:10.939> or<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.510> car

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
if this were or if this was your car

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.560 
if this were or if this was your car
basically<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.119> our<00:01:15.210> starting

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
basically this would be our starting

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
basically this would be our starting
point<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.140> depending<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> mods<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
point and depending on the mods that you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.719 
point and depending on the mods that you
have<00:01:19.130> we<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:21.320> different<00:01:22.320> changes

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
have we would make different changes

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
have we would make different changes
either<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.150> less<00:01:24.360> aggressive<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
either more or less aggressive and so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
either more or less aggressive and so
this<00:01:26.189> shows<00:01:26.729> us<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:26.970> parameters<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this shows us the parameters that we can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.780 
this shows us the parameters that we can
change<00:01:30.200> once<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> save<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
change once we do so we can save it and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.109 
change once we do so we can save it and
flash<00:01:35.790> at<00:01:35.970> work<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.420> using<00:01:37.549> ECU<00:01:38.549> flash<00:01:38.820> which

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
flash at work are using ECU flash which

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.929 
flash at work are using ECU flash which
I<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:40.189> I'll<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.430> over<00:01:41.520> another<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:42.090> but

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
I will I'll go over another time but

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.850 
I will I'll go over another time but
that's<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.509> gist<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.409> logging

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that's the gist of it we do logging

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940 
that's the gist of it we do logging
again<00:01:47.220> after<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.829> need

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
again after that and if we see we need

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.539 
again after that and if we see we need
to<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.909> changes<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.100> repeat

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to make more changes we can just repeat

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.350 
to make more changes we can just repeat
the<00:01:53.729> process<00:01:54.079> does<00:01:55.079> its<00:01:55.229> take<00:01:55.380> very<00:01:55.590> long<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
the process does its take very long and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
the process does its take very long and
that<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.869> make<00:01:57.960> sure<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.530> car

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that way we can make sure that your car

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.490 
that way we can make sure that your car
is<00:01:58.799> running<00:01:58.920> safe<00:01:59.600> again<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.899> Logan<00:02:01.079> from
