00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.910 
stuff going on you get LeBron James who
really<00:00:29.789> dictated<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.750> entire<00:00:31.109> game<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.439> who

really dictated the entire game and who
could<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.219> predicted<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.850> shooting

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
could have predicted the shooting

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
could have predicted the shooting
performance<00:00:33.390> by<00:00:34.230> Steph<00:00:34.290> Curry<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
performance by Steph Curry but it

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
performance by Steph Curry but it
happens<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.420> bounce<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> hopefully<00:00:37.350> we

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
happens we bounce back and hopefully we

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
happens we bounce back and hopefully we
land<00:00:38.250> game<00:00:38.489> 3<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.239> still<00:00:39.420> got<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> big

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
land game 3 and we still got the big

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.420 
land game 3 and we still got the big
serious<00:00:40.260> player<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> Golden<00:00:40.890> State<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.219> well

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
serious player of Golden State as well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
serious player of Golden State as well
which<00:00:41.700> obviously<00:00:42.360> looks<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which obviously looks a little bit in a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
which obviously looks a little bit in a
little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.160> jeopardy<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.000> we're

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
little bit in jeopardy but I think we're

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.220 
little bit in jeopardy but I think we're
going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.420> okay<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.200> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
going to be okay and I actually do think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
going to be okay and I actually do think
we<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.309> strong<00:00:47.460> game<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we have a really really strong game to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
we have a really really strong game to
replay<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.690> everybody<00:00:49.079> okay<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:49.950> we

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
replay for everybody okay well here we

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
replay for everybody okay well here we
go<00:00:50.100> Game<00:00:50.550> three<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.050> Cleveland

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
go Game three right right now Cleveland

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.529 
go Game three right right now Cleveland
is<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.219> home<00:00:53.520> underdog<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.329> think

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
is a one point home underdog and I think

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
is a one point home underdog and I think
that<00:00:54.660> light<00:00:54.840> has<00:00:54.870> moved<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> bit<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.860> saw

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that light has moved a bit i think i saw

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
seen in the NBA playoffs that the market

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
seen in the NBA playoffs that the market
just<00:01:09.390> doesn't<00:01:09.840> adjust<00:01:10.200> totals<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.250> quickly

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
just doesn't adjust totals that quickly

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.260

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
crashing right Game one was like 20 320

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170 
crashing right Game one was like 20 320
for<00:01:18.000> Game<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.630> 199<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:20.009> we're<00:01:20.130> seeing<00:01:20.369> 194

State<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.280> Golden<00:01:41.640> State<00:01:41.850> team<00:01:41.899> is

State I think this Golden State team is
too<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.380> i<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.860> honestly<00:01:44.220> took<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
too good i think they honestly took for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
too good i think they honestly took for
granted<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.240> fact<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.600> Kyrie<00:01:45.899> Irving<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
think
Golden<00:02:12.000> State's<00:02:12.210> obviously<00:02:12.690> proven<00:02:12.900> its

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.300 
I think they're focused I think their
