00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
keeping the tape on here to keep the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.240 
keeping the tape on here to keep the
packing<00:05:27.290> down<00:05:27.440> while<00:05:27.680> you're<00:05:27.800> putting<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.130> in

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
packing down while you're putting it in

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.740 
packing down while you're putting it in
don't<00:05:28.700> do<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.510> whole<00:05:29.720> thing<00:05:29.990> there<00:05:31.750> that's

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
don't do the whole thing there that's

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.680 
don't do the whole thing there that's
just<00:05:32.870> stupid

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.620 

of<00:05:38.690> course<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.050> can<00:05:39.200> do<00:05:39.320> layers<00:05:40.120> on<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.360> if<00:05:41.510> you

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
of course you can do layers on it if you

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.890 
of course you can do layers on it if you
really<00:05:41.810> want<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.200> tightly<00:05:42.410> packed<00:05:42.860> muffler
