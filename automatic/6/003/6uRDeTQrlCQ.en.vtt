 Enjoyable fast driving on the road or race track was guaranteed 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 The combination of rear engine and low weight is still convincing today 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.450
 at a brisk pace 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.000
 Thanks to the advanced Moto construction are performance enhancements 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.300
 pretty easy 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.060

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.400
 not good in the course 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 it's hard on a restoration 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.840
 This was followed by a due new construction for motorsport 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.910
 all under their own control and respecting rural areas in 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.800
 MÃ¼nster blocked a completely new terrain 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.100

 Cloppenburg Pope not 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.510
 Again, the heads would be denied 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.210
 we worked again in late trading Lommel 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.720
 Corporate Twitter 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.560
 Wienerberger so double carburetor 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.400
 Villager the Aldi or 1200 cubic 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.570
 somebody 60 around 65 hp 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 Netzer of 1300 cubic 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.440
 or 21 he is 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.530
 Image is much desired about Deir al-zor 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.000
 consistently lifted and erected on the blue sky 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.920
 Oberleitner 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 Federer takes shape 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.550
 Promoter from Bremen 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.830
 with a warm air went so well 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 after decision 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 the so-called gt as the sixties benefits from the narrow shows it off 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.889
 all from his well-tuned suspension 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:17.219
 like a board flies to the POS and brings its 121 hp ideal and without 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.319
 Loss of power on the asphalt 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.930
 Over or understeer is barely noticeable even on fast cornering 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.659
 the lightweight moves as if on rails 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.019
 have to lead sooner 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.679
 your own house was built so installed 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.449
 with pictures 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.699
 Now we step in the poem is now believed 600 kilos 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.489
 very si-virus 6 and 75 Interpack write it 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.389
 it should be easier 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.750
 that does not only save weight 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 but also a sound will be following numbers 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.429
 the highly bred Enescu engine comes in Harpen racing use with sides 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.979
 June is not enough to avoid overheating of the engine 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.219
 the hatchback must remain open while driving as well 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.609
 the warm air escapes, preventing a heat shock in the engine compartment 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:31.229
 in order to have the nose ahead even in mountain races, the race in Aspen 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.369
 his gear soon translated 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.769
 This was already installed on customer request Identity ex factory 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.239
 This improves the acceleration in turn decreases 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.959
 the final speed 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.959
 fast gear changes are therefore by referendum 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.010
 Vienna 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.450
 the physical commitment as well as the ambition of Richard Walz have become 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.120
 worth 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.810
 his ns and WC is with the lap time of 18 point 46 seconds by far the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.179
 fastest car on the dress St 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.069
 almost half a second faster than that shows that the nose Mitsubishi 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.069
 Carisma IPO victory 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.619
 Richard Holzer not only sees all the Porsche with his investments 

00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:24.279
 BMW and Chevrolet beat but also proves impressively 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.770
 that it can go forward very fast even without a thick purse 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.090
 but beware these dwarfs are addictive
