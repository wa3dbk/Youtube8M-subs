I was lucky my grandfather had taught me
a<00:05:11.410> lot<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.710> things<00:05:11.979> growing<00:05:12.820> up<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.330> eventually

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
a lot of things growing up I eventually

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.540 
a lot of things growing up I eventually
just<00:05:14.050> learned<00:05:14.350> on<00:05:14.560> my<00:05:14.680> own<00:05:14.830> trial<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.370> error

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
just learned on my own trial and error

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.909 
just learned on my own trial and error
and<00:05:15.850> I<00:05:16.450> put<00:05:16.690> that<00:05:16.810> knowledge<00:05:16.990> together<00:05:17.320> over

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and I put that knowledge together over

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.830 
and I put that knowledge together over
many<00:05:18.130> many<00:05:18.340> years<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.790> doing<00:05:19.210> it<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.540> I'm<00:05:19.690> at
