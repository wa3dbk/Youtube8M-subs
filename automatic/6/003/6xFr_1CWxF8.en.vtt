milliamp battery from thunder power 25
seat<00:00:18.550> burst<00:00:18.820> so<00:00:19.570> let's<00:00:19.869> fly<00:00:20.110> this<00:00:20.169> thing<00:00:20.320> and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
seat burst so let's fly this thing and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.929 
seat burst so let's fly this thing and
all<00:00:22.380> let's<00:00:23.380> see<00:00:23.760> how<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.820> batteries<00:00:25.480> do<00:00:26.080> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
all let's see how the batteries do I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.790 
all let's see how the batteries do I
plan<00:00:27.939> to<00:00:27.970> be<00:00:28.269> very<00:00:28.810> promising<00:00:29.289> batteries

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
plan to be very promising batteries

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.729 
plan to be very promising batteries
because<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.490> tried<00:00:30.789> them<00:00:31.000> already<00:00:31.179> so<00:00:32.050> just

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
because I tried them already so just

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.710 
because I tried them already so just
just<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.040> video<00:00:33.339> with<00:00:33.670> them<00:00:33.790> flying<00:00:34.330> with<00:00:34.600> the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
just a video with them flying with the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.380 
just a video with them flying with the
hyperion<00:00:35.699> batteries<00:00:36.699> using<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.780> HP<00:00:37.960> 05<00:00:38.739> s

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.930 
outrunner brushless motor to go punch
that<00:00:47.470> was<00:00:47.710> eighty-five<00:00:48.159> percent<00:00:48.400> on<00:00:48.820> the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
that was eighty-five percent on the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:01:32.380 
that was eighty-five percent on the
pitch<00:00:49.180> on<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.479> punch-out<00:00:49.900> right

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:51.290 

what<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.050> think<00:01:33.590> yes

are<00:01:52.300> we<00:01:52.540> going<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:53.430> suppose<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.460> my<00:01:54.790> wife<00:01:55.000> on

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
are we going to suppose that my wife on

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.960 
are we going to suppose that my wife on
getting<00:01:56.230> everybody<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:57.160> eating<00:01:57.610> breakfast

right now you see i might flying doing

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.660 
right now you see i might flying doing
testing<00:02:04.270> bear<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.810> should<00:02:05.110> be<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.670> eaten

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
testing bear and I should be I eaten

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:19.370 
testing bear and I should be I eaten
breakfast

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.320 

I'm<00:02:19.950> thinking<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.490> very<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.970> go<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.210> be

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
I'm thinking is very to go and be
