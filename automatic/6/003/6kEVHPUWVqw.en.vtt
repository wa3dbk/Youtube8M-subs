and make you feeling I was involved in
the<00:02:09.300> making<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> original<00:02:10.470> Point<00:02:10.709> Break

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the making of the original Point Break

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
the making of the original Point Break
and<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> film<00:02:11.910> has<00:02:12.209> stood<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.660> test

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and I think the film has stood the test

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.990 
and I think the film has stood the test
of<00:02:13.350> time<00:02:13.410> because<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.100> captures<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.850> spirit

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
of time because it captures the spirit

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.330 
of time because it captures the spirit
of<00:02:15.450> what<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> surfer<00:02:16.350> is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
of what a surfer is

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.690 
of what a surfer is
that<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.610> even<00:02:20.360> say<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:21.680> Chris<00:02:21.950> Sharma<00:02:22.190> my
