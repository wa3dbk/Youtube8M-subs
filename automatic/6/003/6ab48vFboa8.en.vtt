you know you want re clarification on it

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
you know you want re clarification on it
I've<00:00:26.519> already<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.359> videos<00:00:27.720> on

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
I've already got like two videos on

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.169 
I've already got like two videos on
shifting<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.650> search<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.070> shifting<00:00:29.609> or

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
shifting so this search for shifting or

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.209 
shifting so this search for shifting or
shift<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.900> m13<00:00:33.440> but<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> those<00:00:34.739> videos<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
shift and m13 but in those videos I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.850 
shift and m13 but in those videos I
don't<00:00:35.370> cover<00:00:35.660> emergency<00:00:36.660> stops<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.290> like

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
don't cover emergency stops or like

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
don't cover emergency stops or like
quick<00:00:38.100> stops<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.180> an<00:00:39.300> aggressive<00:00:39.570> rider

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

because<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.820> quick<00:00:42.540> stopping<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.079> lot<00:00:43.320> like

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

so yeah the question is how do I shift

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
so yeah the question is how do I shift
down<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.010> doing<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.610> because<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.719> know

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.219 
down when I'm doing it because you know
like<00:01:04.140> normally<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:06.229> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
know you brake you brake your rpms drop

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530 
know you brake you brake your rpms drop
and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.590> hold<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> clutch<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.270> blip

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and then you hold in the clutch you blip

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.359 
and then you hold in the clutch you blip
the<00:01:12.690> throttle<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> bring<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.009> RPMs

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the throttle to kind of bring the RPMs

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.040 
the throttle to kind of bring the RPMs
up<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> match<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> next<00:01:15.270> lower<00:01:15.479> gear<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
up to match the next lower gear you

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.350 
up to match the next lower gear you
shift<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.220> repeat<00:01:17.670> repeat<00:01:17.970> repeat

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
shift down and then repeat repeat repeat

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
shift down and then repeat repeat repeat
but<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.050> you're<00:01:19.140> stopping<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.740> quickly

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
but if you're stopping really quickly

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you can't really there's no time

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
you can't really there's no time
flip<00:01:21.990> throttles<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.649> whatnot<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.470> yeah<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
flip throttles and whatnot so yeah so in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.859 
flip throttles and whatnot so yeah so in
a<00:01:26.580> few<00:01:26.790> more<00:01:26.909> seconds<00:01:27.270> we'll<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> bigger

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
a few more seconds we'll get to a bigger

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
a few more seconds we'll get to a bigger
road<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> we'll<00:01:28.590> practice<00:01:29.220> doing<00:01:29.520> some<00:01:29.729> quick

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
road and we'll practice doing some quick

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
road and we'll practice doing some quick
stops

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.010

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
driving my car on this road at the past

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.270 
driving my car on this road at the past
and<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.049> oncoming<00:01:50.289> lane<00:01:50.439> around<00:01:50.890> those<00:01:51.009> blind

corners and quite obviously I wouldn't
do<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.619> cuz<00:01:54.039> it'd<00:01:54.130> be<00:01:54.280> like<00:01:54.810> suicidally

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
do that cuz it'd be like suicidally

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.669 
do that cuz it'd be like suicidally
stupid<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:58.030> Li<00:01:58.479> it's<00:01:58.719> legal<00:01:59.110> that's<00:01:59.350> and

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
stupid but Li it's legal that's and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.429 
stupid but Li it's legal that's and
that's<00:01:59.860> why<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.579> know<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:01.509> Taiwan<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.110> got<00:02:02.350> to

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
that's why you know in Taiwan you got to

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.469 
that's why you know in Taiwan you got to
cut<00:02:02.560> me<00:02:02.649> some<00:02:02.799> slack<00:02:02.860> just<00:02:03.399> because<00:02:03.729> there's<00:02:04.390> a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
cut me some slack just because there's a

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.690 
cut me some slack just because there's a
double<00:02:04.750> solid<00:02:05.020> yellow<00:02:05.200> doesn't<00:02:06.130> mean<00:02:06.280> it's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
double solid yellow doesn't mean it's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.850 
double solid yellow doesn't mean it's
not<00:02:07.509> safe<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.959> pass<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:08.739> there

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
not safe to pass and just because there

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.469 
not safe to pass and just because there
isn't<00:02:09.039> doesn't<00:02:09.549> mean<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.060> safe<00:02:10.330> to

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
isn't doesn't mean that it is safe to

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.860 
isn't doesn't mean that it is safe to
pass<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.080> Taiwan<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.130> really<00:02:12.870> can't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
pass and in Taiwan you you really can't

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.380 
pass and in Taiwan you you really can't
just<00:02:14.079> go<00:02:14.410> by<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.590> lines<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.700> I've

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
just go by the lines because I've

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
just go by the lines because I've
literally<00:02:16.930> seen<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.470> long<00:02:17.709> straightaway<00:02:18.340> with

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
literally seen a long straightaway with

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580 
literally seen a long straightaway with
double<00:02:19.150> solid<00:02:19.420> yellow<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:20.019> then<00:02:20.349> as<00:02:20.470> you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
double solid yellow and then as you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.470 
double solid yellow and then as you
approach<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.280> 90-degree<00:02:21.910> corner<00:02:22.329> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
approach the like 90-degree corner it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.289 
approach the like 90-degree corner it
changes<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> segmented<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
changes to a segmented it's like like I

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.370 
changes to a segmented it's like like I
honestly<00:02:25.599> think<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> people<00:02:26.019> making<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
honestly think the people making the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.900 
honestly think the people making the
lines<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:26.829> just<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> clue

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
lines like just don't have a clue

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.940 
lines like just don't have a clue
they're<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.620> probably<00:02:29.620> some<00:02:29.829> guy

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
they're just like probably some guy

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.380 
they're just like probably some guy

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
segmented and one for solids and he just

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.039 
segmented and one for solids and he just
like<00:02:33.730> randomly<00:02:34.120> pushes<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.660> buttons<00:02:34.959> you

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049

there's<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.400> car<00:03:51.640> behind<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.150> he<00:03:52.239> sees<00:03:52.420> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
there's a car behind you he sees the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.699 
there's a car behind you he sees the
light<00:03:52.660> goes<00:03:52.810> green<00:03:52.870> Sweetarts<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.470> give<00:03:53.590> it

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
light goes green Sweetarts to give it

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.500 
light goes green Sweetarts to give it
gas<00:03:53.860> again<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:54.459> meanwhile<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:55.000> don't<00:03:55.420> really

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
gas again but meanwhile you don't really

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.300 
gas again but meanwhile you don't really
know<00:03:55.690> what<00:03:55.810> gear<00:03:56.019> you're<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.410> or<00:03:56.590> whatnot<00:03:56.769> and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
know what gear you're in or whatnot and

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.039 
know what gear you're in or whatnot and
you<00:03:57.820> let<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> clutch<00:03:58.239> back<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.900> find

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
you let the clutch back out and you find

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.509 
you let the clutch back out and you find
you<00:03:59.230> after<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.620> shoots<00:03:59.829> it<00:03:59.920> down<00:03:59.950> too<00:04:00.280> quickly

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
you after you shoots it down too quickly

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.490 
you after you shoots it down too quickly
so<00:04:00.850> now<00:04:01.299> you're<00:04:01.480> doing<00:04:01.600> like<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> you're<00:04:02.320> still

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
so now you're doing like a you're still

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.900 
so now you're doing like a you're still
doing<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> fairly<00:04:03.070> quick<00:04:03.280> speed<00:04:03.519> but<00:04:03.730> you're<00:04:03.820> in

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
doing a fairly quick speed but you're in

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.370 
doing a fairly quick speed but you're in
first<00:04:04.060> gear<00:04:04.390> is<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.570> let<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.810> clutch<00:04:05.200> out

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
first gear is you let the clutch out

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.050 
first gear is you let the clutch out
your<00:04:05.620> rear<00:04:05.769> tire<00:04:06.010> locks<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.579> shoot<00:04:06.730> back<00:04:06.910> at

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
your rear tire locks you shoot back at

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.310 
your rear tire locks you shoot back at
that<00:04:07.180> car<00:04:07.360> behind<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:07.870> accelerating

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
that car behind it it's accelerating

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.610 
that car behind it it's accelerating
right<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:09.239> not<00:04:10.239> great<00:04:10.860> but<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.109> guess<00:04:14.320> it's

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
right so not great but so I guess it's

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.050 
right so not great but so I guess it's
better<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.980> be<00:04:15.070> in<00:04:15.130> too<00:04:15.280> high<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.700> gear<00:04:15.910> than

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
better to be in too high of a gear than

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.210 
better to be in too high of a gear than
too<00:04:16.239> low<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.630> gear<00:04:17.019> because<00:04:17.169> at<00:04:17.919> least<00:04:18.039> you

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
too low of a gear because at least you

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
too low of a gear because at least you
won't<00:04:18.310> lock<00:04:18.519> up<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.880> rear<00:04:18.910> right<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.850> yeah

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
won't lock up the rear right but yeah

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.529 
won't lock up the rear right but yeah
they're<00:04:23.560> here<00:04:23.830> I'm<00:04:24.460> an<00:04:24.580> ex<00:04:24.789> I'm<00:04:24.910> here<00:04:25.419> right

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.270 

okay<00:04:58.950> 60<00:04:59.400> miles<00:04:59.580> an<00:04:59.730> hour<00:05:02.570> traffic<00:05:03.770> okay<00:05:04.770> 60

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
okay 60 miles an hour traffic okay 60

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.420 
okay 60 miles an hour traffic okay 60
miles<00:05:05.490> an<00:05:05.640> hour<00:05:05.730> and<00:05:06.500> one<00:05:07.500> one<00:05:08.040> thousand<00:05:08.400> two

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
miles an hour and one one thousand two

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.010 
miles an hour and one one thousand two
one<00:05:08.520> thousand<00:05:09.150> three<00:05:09.180> one<00:05:09.330> thousand<00:05:09.750> four<00:05:09.870> one

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
one thousand three one thousand four one

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.290 
one thousand three one thousand four one
thousand<00:05:10.560> five<00:05:10.590> thousand<00:05:11.490> okay<00:05:11.640> five<00:05:11.880> seconds

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
thousand five thousand okay five seconds

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.000 
thousand five thousand okay five seconds
okay<00:05:12.510> so<00:05:13.230> you<00:05:13.290> got

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
okay so you got

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.070 
okay so you got
I<00:05:14.040> went<00:05:14.640> from<00:05:14.730> sixty<00:05:15.090> miles<00:05:15.270> an<00:05:15.390> hour<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.870> dead

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
I went from sixty miles an hour to dead

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.010 
I went from sixty miles an hour to dead
stuff<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.620> roughly<00:05:17.180> five<00:05:18.180> or<00:05:18.420> six<00:05:18.600> seconds

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
stuff and roughly five or six seconds

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.630 
stuff and roughly five or six seconds
and<00:05:19.170> you've<00:05:19.320> got<00:05:19.440> five<00:05:19.650> or<00:05:19.680> six<00:05:19.980> gears<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.490> that

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
and you've got five or six gears so that

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.090 
and you've got five or six gears so that
means<00:05:20.910> you're<00:05:21.180> braking<00:05:21.630> hard<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.860> should<00:05:23.010> be

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
means you're braking hard you should be

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.510 
means you're braking hard you should be
shifting<00:05:23.490> down<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:23.730> gear<00:05:24.530> about<00:05:25.530> once<00:05:25.950> one

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
shifting down a gear about once one

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.280 
shifting down a gear about once one
every<00:05:27.980> second<00:05:28.980> or<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:29.340> right

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.650 

so<00:05:34.250> it's<00:05:34.580> kind<00:05:34.790> of<00:05:34.880> like<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:35.210> kind<00:05:35.270> of<00:05:35.390> hard

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
so it's kind of like it's kind of hard

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.690 
so it's kind of like it's kind of hard
to<00:05:35.870> not<00:05:36.170> be<00:05:36.680> in<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.950> right<00:05:37.100> gear<00:05:37.340> because<00:05:37.520> if

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
to not be in the right gear because if

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.890 
to not be in the right gear because if
you've<00:05:37.820> been<00:05:37.880> if<00:05:38.150> you've<00:05:38.270> been<00:05:38.390> breaking<00:05:38.600> for

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
you've been if you've been breaking for

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.330 
you've been if you've been breaking for
three<00:05:39.110> seconds<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.680> all<00:05:39.950> of<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.070> sudden<00:05:40.100> you

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
three seconds and all of a sudden you

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.010 
three seconds and all of a sudden you
know<00:05:40.760> if<00:05:40.880> you're<00:05:41.030> supposed<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.300> break<00:05:41.510> if<00:05:41.960> you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
know if you're supposed to break if you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.510 
know if you're supposed to break if you
need<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.350> break<00:05:42.470> for<00:05:42.680> six<00:05:42.890> seconds<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.310> be<00:05:43.400> at<00:05:43.490> a

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
need to break for six seconds to be at a

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.910 
need to break for six seconds to be at a

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
and then and then it would break and

and then and then it would break and
roughly<00:06:37.910> the<00:06:37.940> same<00:06:38.120> time<00:06:38.270> as<00:06:38.330> this<00:06:38.540> bike<00:06:38.750> five

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
roughly the same time as this bike five

roughly the same time as this bike five
six<00:06:39.290> seconds<00:06:39.650> and<00:06:40.090> so<00:06:41.090> it<00:06:41.300> would<00:06:41.390> still<00:06:41.540> apply
