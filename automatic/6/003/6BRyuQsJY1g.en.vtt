00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.679
 welcome to this is the next steps to demonstrate e 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.429
 explain in detail in a very very simple way clear 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.109
 how to make a cover to know 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.610
 to start dedicating myself 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.350
 those that in your own self in so many projects for example those of dreams 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.079
 gold 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.489
 those that are made so many times we will visit step by step a lot 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.460
 simply how slowly to have this blanket analyzed 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.499
 which allows 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.670
 so as if dogs 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.039
 a border of a contrasting color 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.140
 euro board all around 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.800
 master mattress all the phases 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.810
 from the beginning learn to draw the bourgeois embroideries already made 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.070
 cut and place the edges you see in purple choose the size 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.400
 of the outer bands quintarelli 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.990
 you can see 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.090
 buy 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.460
 all around individual parts 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.149
 and finally to bathe my attempts for all the blanket 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.969
 I give you some size about the canon blanket made us short size 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.810
 obviously completely change based on what your are 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.960
 needs 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.060
 the small size how many series inches as explained above in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760
 another video 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.670
 unfortunately I need class is a matter of poles because most of them 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.610
 part of the models of references are all in inches 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 therefore it is convenient 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 content 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.729
 so the blanket is over our house is 55 inches by 41 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.929
 it's a good fit for a baby's cot 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.980
 I stop you from embroidering, measures of this you can then cut not those 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.959
 which then will be assigned what it says in the mouth 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.829
 however, as it is in blocks of spare parts 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.130
 they are 7 and a half inches 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.069
 for 7 inches and a half 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.919
 in lady 902 fabrics 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.950
 a room at the start the pyre forming the frames only and the bandit who 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:27.749
 around 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.159
 it is a blue terraforming fabric instead of a cd head outer edge 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.769
 indoor 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.939
 the purple cloth we cut 12 pieces 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.779
 if these are the smallest 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.659
 that the referee sleeps and then received 7 and a half inches on Monday 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.169
 and other 12 pieces that are longer on the other side of the embroidery and are 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.389
 always the referee and then you say and they are 12 and a half inches long 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:02.510
 after Christmas to you instead of the butterfly room we have 4 pieces 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.979
 these are the ones that hurt to live 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.919
 spare parts 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.399
 that I sleep two and a half inches wide 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.519
 and they are 12 and a half inches long 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.349
 a long piece that this central one you see that goes to divide to the central 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.660
 our blocks always two and a half inches wide the 32 inch and e wave 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:27.769
 finally 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.889
 the four pieces that go to form the edges and these are 7 inches wide 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.569
 and a half and we'll talk 4 about the height of the fabric 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.969
 then the sat tv bracket and the gaffe rai 42 and 44 l hermitage 4 from the strips each 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.909
 of 7 inches and a half 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.719
 at this point the only other thing we miss is the paiella that must be a 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.930
 little more than what the cover ended up our women for 41 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.689
 for 55 so 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.859
 abound with little 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.509
 the grass in the face for the whole border we say around that 3 inches wide 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.379
 and the length you will make it still on your blanket I don't know anyway 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.659
 when were 5 star scenes 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.229
 d height. 3 then you say taken from full height the fabric then again 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.340
 we fold our complete fabric in two 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.889
 that of love because always 42 44 inches in Italian 5 well strips and black dots 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.139
 3 inches 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.020
 we will unite them you can make one male strips will be towards the bottom of the free 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.620
 see below 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 ems I'd say that's all 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.870
 so we can go and start have to take our embroideries are we have 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.729
 spare parts we don't want to get them we can find other designs 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.910
 of fabric, square designs with me 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.259
 they can be pillows for pillows for example 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.900
 and we can therefore put to the test goodbye also all that car from 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.139
 to sew euro planes for the carters on which to cut your vat goblets 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.589
 and you are ready
