00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 continuous training works in which 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.610
 most efficient seminars 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 studies at school or mentoring as 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.730
 ensure that it is not a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.089
 graduation 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:24.180
 this is the theme of the special report on 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:26.010
 education in the last few months you can 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 follow here in the education newspaper 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 our series of reports on the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 main demands of teachers 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.399
 of basic education 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.829
 according to a survey carried out in our 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 site is still poorly paid 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.820
 it's time to talk about a lawsuit 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 fundamental for teachers 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 working conditions such as the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.010
 quality of the courses that form the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.590
 teachers of basic education 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 the subject now is continued education 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.969
 what is and what is it for? 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.280
 pathways to a truly 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 meet the demands of the classroom 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 these are some of the topics covered in the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.710
 last report of the series what they want 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.360
 teachers best teachers 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 fashion best students 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 may seem clichÃ© but it's a fact 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 research shows that there are students who 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.350
 study with the best teachers of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.060
 a network can learn between 47 and 70% 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
 more than they learned from teachers 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 less prepared to improve the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.509
 learning the training of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.759
 teachers the most accessible initiative 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.259
 informs and efficient survey of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 organization for cooperation and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.640
 economic development to cdr 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 yet the report produced by the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 unesco in 2009 and stresses that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 conditions of teacher training in the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.009
 Brazil are those who are satisfactory 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 according to experts a 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.090
 characteristic of training programs 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.799
 continued is its compensatory character 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.759
 the graduates of teaching that among the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.030
 schools 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.799
 they have in the column are many votes of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.130
 information and then said the school 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.770
 needs to be replenished 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.229
 have been made in initial training beyond 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.360
 In most cases, the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.399
 standardization of courses have the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.290
 disconsider 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.599
 specific needs of each school 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.269
 that we have in Brazil today is a 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.129
 continuing education, which is very much 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.530
 then the teacher is when he 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.360
 will need a training he will 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.129
 look for training institutes 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 teachers to the civil 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.599
 is being offered and will choose it 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.700
 as if it were a menu that this 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.530
 little time that is called work 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.829
 collective at school he is being 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.980
 busy by external demands so I guess 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.959
 the local training that is done 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.349
 with the mediation of the coordinators 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.750
 teachers or other teachers 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.200
 she also loses her 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.879
 creative potential is and in support of 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.730
 pedagogical project of the school in 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.430
 in which this space has also been 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.519
 lined from the outside, right? 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.010
 many states are still talking 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.659
 There you have an older teacher. 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.700
 beginner teacher that the most 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.540
 experienced less experienced teacher 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.510
 professor of several lines is not like this 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.730
 people have cycle life cycle of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.739
 professional life and this life cycle 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.160
 It also does not 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.280
 needs then this model 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.889
 Everyone talks to everyone, it's a model. 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.620
 that own desk already know that 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.480
 is not 4 study conducted by boston 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.389
 consulting group and ayrton institute 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.729
 sena heard almost 3 thousand people who are 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.129
 specialists from the secretariat of 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.959
 education to outline the 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.590
 continuing education initiatives in the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.870
 parents 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.430
 according to the research the obstacles to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.440
 be overcome to improve the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.949
 quality of in-service training are 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.010
 lack of formal incentives scarcity 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.389
 of time by teachers 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.180
 gaps and lowering the applicability of 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.590
 contents of the actions offered 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.560
 preference for short-term actions and 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.760
 high visibility and high turnover 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.069
 faculty 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.840
 besides the diagnosis of the difficulties the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.180
 researchers looked for examples of 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.349
 initiatives in other countries that can 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.000
 adapted to the needs of the 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.680
 brazilian 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.600
 one of the most 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.090
 especially for teachers in 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.530
 beginning of career are the initiatives of 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.509
 coaching improvement is renowned mentoring that 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.940
 if you want to give 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.340
 teachers in the initial years two or 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.100
 three and three years that we 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.780
 realized the need isis that people 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.060
 evaluated is that this type of practice is 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.570
 very important this type of practice 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.949
 has that is associated with incentives and 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.500
 has that is associated is also a 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.970
 This evaluation classifies the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.430
 teachers in career steps so 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.789
 beginner without a consolidated teacher will be 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.099
 experienced teacher etc. and from this 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.720
 classification are offered in assets 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.400
 of information for each of the steps 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.759
 of the teacher's career 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.560
 then it is not an evaluation and dedicated to 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.150
 dismiss teachers to exclude 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.289
 teachers to offer the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.699
 teachers 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.380
 what is lacking in practice 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.139
 of them in the day to day the specialists 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.880
 the potential of 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.280
 projects involving follow-up 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.080
 individualized teaching work 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.930
 You can do this in many ways. 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.360
 huh 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.479
 One way would be to open the 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.120
 class make the same school of noca 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.120
 learning for the teacher then 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.210
 teachers attend a class of the 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.970
 colleague, someone more experienced and 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.250
 thence news problems discuss and in the 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.360
 collective 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.729
 several suggestions to be re- planned if 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.840
 take a new lesson but always have to 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.419
 someone who cuts the asx olympique earthquake 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.430
 who lives the teacher who is very isolated 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:03.919
 This is a learning situation that 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.340
 which gives meaning to the theories that 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.919
 are discussed is for analysis 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.699
 problems to interrogate the reality of 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.970
 classroom is from the school where 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.580
 model is being revisit the 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.639
 known from the classroom at school 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.789
 where they deal with all the challenges 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.990
 conditions that are not always optimal 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.469
 I do not work 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.870
 the school in which to assume this role of 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.490
 teacher trainer 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.800
 will have to be the locus the training that 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.960
 She'll have to be equipped for it. 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.580
 look at your faculty and 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.170
 I managed to establish strategies 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.960
 a strategy that would be 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.960
 efficient for example would be each school 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.760
 each board identify good practices 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.110
 identify more experienced teachers 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.970
 and create conditions for these 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.680
 more experienced teachers were 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.650
 teacher mentors tutors 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.440
 beginners would not be right there in the 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.690
 agency would be well contextualized 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.880
 in that universe if we have a 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.620
 more experienced teacher a coordinator 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.020
 well equipped pedagogic 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.760
 the supervisor has prepared by observing 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.800
 teacher class after giving 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.390
 feedback following this over 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.340
 time and this would certainly be a 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.950
 initiative that would have a major impact on 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.260
 in the careers of these teachers and the 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.330
 success of these initiatives, the central 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.070
 of continuing education should be the 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.400
 collective work within one's own 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.400
 school
