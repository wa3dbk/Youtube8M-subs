now<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.560> amp<00:01:30.770> can<00:01:30.950> do<00:01:31.130> several<00:01:31.550> wats<00:01:31.820> on<00:01:32.180> two

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
now this amp can do several wats on two

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.359 
now this amp can do several wats on two
tubes<00:01:33.160> 15<00:01:34.160> watts<00:01:34.460> on<00:01:34.640> two<00:01:34.850> tubes<00:01:35.920> 15<00:01:36.920> watts<00:01:37.190> on

tubes 15 watts on two tubes 15 watts on

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.410 
tubes 15 watts on two tubes 15 watts on
four<00:01:37.640> tubes<00:01:38.229> 30<00:01:39.229> watts<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.890> four<00:01:40.160> tubes<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
four tubes 30 watts on four tubes and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.240 
four tubes 30 watts on four tubes and
the<00:01:41.509> impedance<00:01:41.930> is<00:01:42.080> always<00:01:42.410> taken<00:01:42.740> care<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.979> in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the impedance is always taken care of in

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
the impedance is always taken care of in
the<00:01:43.310> background<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.210> always<00:01:44.479> what<00:01:44.660> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
the background so it's always what it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.560 
the background so it's always what it
says<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.610> even<00:01:46.610> when<00:01:46.759> you're<00:01:46.910> switching<00:01:47.180> to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
says is even when you're switching to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.999 
says is even when you're switching to
shows<00:01:47.840> four<00:01:48.200> tubes<00:01:48.500> etc<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.320> sounds<00:01:51.800> on

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
shows four tubes etc and it sounds on

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
shows four tubes etc and it sounds on
the<00:01:52.600> fat<00:01:53.600> channel

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the fat channel

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:21.369 
the fat channel
it<00:01:55.860> sounds<00:01:56.220> pretty<00:01:56.369> much<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.610> this

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.300 

so<00:02:22.379> we're<00:02:22.560> also<00:02:22.680> launching<00:02:24.650> three<00:02:25.650> new

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
so we're also launching three new

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.140 
so we're also launching three new
isobaric<00:02:27.239> base<00:02:27.750> cabinets<00:02:28.459> which<00:02:29.459> means

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
isobaric base cabinets which means

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.759 
isobaric base cabinets which means
there's<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.480> speaker<00:02:30.750> behind<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.560> speaker

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
there's a speaker behind the speaker

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.160 
there's a speaker behind the speaker
which<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.310> helping<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.360> front<00:02:33.629> speaker<00:02:33.989> move

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
which is helping the front speaker move

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.470 
which is helping the front speaker move
air<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.769> as<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> portuguese<00:02:35.700> adjusted

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
air and as a portuguese adjusted

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.170 
air and as a portuguese adjusted
accordingly<00:02:36.980> we've<00:02:37.980> got<00:02:38.129> 2<00:02:38.310> for<00:02:38.459> 12<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
accordingly we've got 2 for 12 here the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.130 
accordingly we've got 2 for 12 here the
size<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.599> 1<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:39.989> 12<00:02:41.390> they<00:02:42.390> put<00:02:42.660> out<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> sound

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
size of 1 for 12 they put out a sound

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
size of 1 for 12 they put out a sound
pressure<00:02:43.410> pretty<00:02:44.040> much<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.549> tuba<00:02:45.000> 12<00:02:45.269> would

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
pressure pretty much the tuba 12 would

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.650 
pressure pretty much the tuba 12 would
if<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.349> standard<00:02:47.010> size<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.299> half

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
if it was standard size but it's half

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.229 
if it was standard size but it's half
the<00:02:48.750> size<00:02:48.840> right<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.799> rules<00:02:50.459> also<00:02:50.730> got<00:02:51.060> to

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the size right so rules also got to

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.180 
the size right so rules also got to
attend<00:02:51.569> which<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.410> chaps<00:02:52.769> hiding

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
attend which is a little chaps hiding

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.050 
attend which is a little chaps hiding
bad<00:02:53.340> idea<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:55.829> we<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.099> 4<00:02:56.430> by<00:02:56.579> 10<00:02:56.819> which<00:02:57.030> is

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
bad idea and we have a 4 by 10 which is

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.770 
bad idea and we have a 4 by 10 which is
over<00:02:57.450> there<00:02:59.000> you<00:03:00.000> could<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.269> see<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.480> back

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
over there you could just see the back

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.350 
over there you could just see the back
of<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.079> here<00:03:01.430> along<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.849> got<00:03:03.030> brand-new

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
of in here along with we got brand-new

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.990 
of in here along with we got brand-new
