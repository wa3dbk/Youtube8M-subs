00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello there is an album with you 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:22.039
 even today's mod and small he 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.380
 adds a very cool thing and to her 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.320
 get we need to take first 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.829
 pickax in hand here took pickax in hand and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.920
 we jump a cobblestone here to us of one block 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:37.370
 enough now we need a workbench set 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.770
 here we open and exhibit in any 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.539
 slot you liked your cobblestone 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.760
 then we get 5 pebbles 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.350
 also you can do without workbench 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 just in your inventory 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.739
 here we have five pebbles and with them we can 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.260
 throw each pebble and a half 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.200
 units of damage that is one and a half 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.239
 heart let's throw go to yourself here 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.519
 she flies flies flies flies flies flies 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.740
 and get up and we no longer have 10 hearts 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.320
 how many nine and a half and let's them 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.680
 We test the mobs to take as 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.750
 snowballs and more of our pebbles but 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.899
 now we need to sleep 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.759
 water creeps start falling and shooting 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.969
 on the part of skyway to the right we shoot we shoot 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.719
 we shoot we shoot already lined up almost 30 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.359
 and 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.579
 as you see he does not die although in 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.560
 In principle, it seems as if damage to him 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.279
 applied here we shot it all 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.289
 snowballs are 64 pieces and he is not dead now 

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:47.450
 let's out of rubbing a pebble in the example 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:48.920
 left two three 4 5 six 7 7 strokes 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.090
 we kill the creeper 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.340
 that is, you can imagine such 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.399
 situation in which this mod will be useful you 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.579
 walking on mine attacks you could but u 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.179
 you have no weapons and so with him 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.880
 fight 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.060
 you will have to take a cobblestone put it 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 quick so me 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
 so you get 5 pebbles which you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.770
 you can beat off this mod 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.930
 oh mom, by the way, it's very convenient and 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.430
 even though it’s a little mod after all 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.380
 really very convenient mod 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.470
 I think it will be useful to everyone so 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.580
 install will not regret 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.970
 the only thing that I don't like is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.180

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.459
