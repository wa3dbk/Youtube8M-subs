00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.700
 Well, here we are. 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.550
 Thank you for the wonderful evening. 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.450
 No thanks! 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.140
 Yeah ... good night. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.930
 Night. 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.210
 Hey ... 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.310
 Yes a?? 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.010
 You know, actually I do not want to go home now. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.470
 How about "Hey James, have another drink"? 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.400
 Or a coffee? 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.120
 James, I know you want to come in. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.180
 I also know that you might want more than a drink or coffee. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.030
 But it is so... 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.360
 I'm just not drunk enough! 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 Okaay ... so you do not like me? 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 Of course I like you. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.870
 I'm just not drunk enough to find you attractive! 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.240
 I want to be drunk enough. 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.840
 But why are not you drunk now? 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.090
 I'm just drunk! 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.060
 I can barely stand. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 I'm just not drunk enough! 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.280
 Can I do something there? 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 No ... because you are just not attractive! 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 But I took you to the Oktoberfest! 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.570
 I know!! 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.220
 I drank the beer there. 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.060
 I really tried it! 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.680
 I drank my body weight in German beer! 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.260
 I was totally over because I was drinking all the time. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.390
 I was arrested. 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090
 Two times !!! 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.830
 But it was still not enough !! 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.900
 Maybe you will never be drunk enough. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 Oh, James I really like you! 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.200
 If only it would not really disgust me 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.740
 the way you look! 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.170
 And if there was an operation, 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.050
 which allows you to have more alcohol in your blood. 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.880
 James, you know, my life is broken! 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.090
 I drink so much because I try to find you attractive. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.970
 My doctor says if I keep this up, I'll be dead within a year! 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.950
 Good night, James. 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.340
 Pat, ... 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 Call me...
