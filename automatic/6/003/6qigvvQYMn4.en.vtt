 video time is not staying a week but 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.050
 I posted a video two days ago from 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.920
 of the second part of Roberto but he already had 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.279

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.440
 only needed to send and more to record 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.020

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 today even today that I do not know today 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.780
 What I think today will be a great day. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.510
 November 6 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 and as the second episode of the series 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.149
 show maps I'm here with a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.890
 small map of new york nymex ine 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.719
 here you get on top of the empire state 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.020
 and a person it is not very big and it is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 very small but I liked it, I found it 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.489
 cool this map checkered in crime 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.170
 size and chess 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.770
 for those who do not know the new york is like this 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.320
 also is is the city is all made is all 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:21.619
 getting a city map is a type 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 this same board is not checked 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 Copy it, it's really cool. It 's very small. 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.790
 but I do not know what to ask if he has 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.979
 some buildings some must be famous 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.180
 others are not recognized any 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.860
 to the empire state and it can be 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 against out there will not let you on 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.649
 way the description of the video is just you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.869
 they should look for you, they will find 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.810
 I do not know the guys on another map 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.759
 also folks the guy made a city 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.610
 very very big 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.979
 not this jewel here the name of the map and new 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.110
 york also from new york city 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.770
 but the personal city without giving a voice 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.850
 they will see that there are two more twins 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.070
 from malaysia 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 and for those who do not know our is neither 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.120
 New York is obvious and in some buildings 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 famous the empire state the twin towers 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.599
 old photos 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 have been knocked over some other 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:25.290
 famous young people and August the unknown 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 here the guy made a mister a subway zinho 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 here in the middle of a train station, right? 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.280
 I thought it was pretty cool going up there in 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.459
 map background one begins and ends here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.840
 As I said, it's very small and simple. 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.739
 basic 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.890
 I just wanted to show that even though 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.420
 to be small not a job to do 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 This is where I'll leave the best for the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.629
 last right 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.090
 I showed a small hogwarts map 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.269
 They will also like potter craft that is well 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.040
 more complete and has another good 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.810
 other things much cooler 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.459
 I'll show you another one too. 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.269
 city ​​that is the city I said well 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.400
 great 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.709
 who says that this new york but not 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.360
 can be because there are several buildings that 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.670
 do not stay in new york 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.799
 clear that in some famous buildings 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.680
 great games but we lacked light then the 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.410
 man can not say that they already receive 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 and something has a doubt I do not know if it is 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.019
 the game was the country try you're this 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.660
 team state 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.079
 can be from here to this is also the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.690
 format the same 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.799
 He's a little guy, I do not know if he's here. 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.069
 to do the interior I think it did is do 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:54.989
 see and even made the city creator 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:57.750
 library who knows is library is 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.099
 city ​​does not excuse me solid downtown 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.690
 It's always here, it's always my library. 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.690
 I do not think it's the creator's name here. 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.299
 on the map not to leave the mark on it 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:16.109
 made the interior very simple but at 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:19.979
 the less he did training center is 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.079
 Nice guy was very creative that he does not have 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.240
 popcorn on 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.550
 and the whole building here has interior 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.500
 simple but has and is what is enough is not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.979
 important to our city I think 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.780
 was really cool was not so great I 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.699
 I'll show you in another video the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.740
 other agencies will see who do not even 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.039
 in another city and I will have to do more 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.430
 a video probably in three or four 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.340
 videos that are very very large and 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.060
 really gives of 2010 here I found more 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.370
 cool 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 I 'll create a server with it and record 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.530
 in one of the subscribers and enjoy and do the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.780
 third episode would not say third but 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.250
 one of the episodes of this series and the other 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.159
 playing series with the subscribers as well 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.690
 so I can enjoy and I also think 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.469
 who has more to show as I already said is 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.469
 very small here 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:30.410
 It's personal, that's all I think. 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:33.920
 This explains why it is just another 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.120
 test and I do not know if I commented with this 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.100
 video I think how do I go? 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.650
 comment again I stayed a week 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.980
 without recording because I traveled in that 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.290
 holiday then I had a good time and I found 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.950
 Tight then back in this video 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.010
 on here 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.900
 I will try to pass today is 6 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.260
 November did not know that today I think 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.200
 these November and staff and subscribers 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.930
 they sent me and they sent my mailbox 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:06.800
 Entry to listen and he was asking 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:09.790
 a tornado in a series is the walk can 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.590
 gta san andreas saying 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.320
 I have had all missions from the beginning to 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.270
 the end of the game and I 'm thinking of 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.790
 do you write the 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.100
 comments you think of the channel 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.890
 anal and mail talking we will not leave 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.790
 a drug or maybe five I always 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.240
 I liked the game 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:33.410
 we already several times with molds in morris 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:40.580
 and if you want I can make a 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:44.240
 tornado and I believe it's over 60 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.810
 70 episodes because the game is fulfilled and 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.460
 children of 15 and another quite a video and 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.480
 You have patience too the titles 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.660
 video 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.160
 Think about it from the comments I hope 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.820
 that you have liked the map of 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.650
 new york and oxy in may ef 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.330
 if I like what I do not know 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.430
 like what I did not like wrote 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.610
 commenting because they liked it very much 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.980
 and you have subscribed to your subscription 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.750
 It's very important, it helps a lot. 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.290
 the video also helps a lot to spread 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.480
 from unmik and I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.240
