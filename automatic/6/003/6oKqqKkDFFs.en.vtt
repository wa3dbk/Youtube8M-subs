00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
minecraft is don't dig straight up but

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.939 
minecraft is don't dig straight up but
what<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> show<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.840> today<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.439> how

what I'm here to show you today is how

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.300 
what I'm here to show you today is how
to<00:00:23.369> dig<00:00:23.640> straight<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.390> safeway<00:00:24.900> um

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
to dig straight up this the safeway um

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.500 
to dig straight up this the safeway um
there's<00:00:26.310> two<00:00:26.550> different<00:00:26.699> ways<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.300> do

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
there's two different ways you can do

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.169 
there's two different ways you can do
this<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:28.140> lot<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> people<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> latter<00:00:29.760> which

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
this a lot of people do the latter which

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.959 
this a lot of people do the latter which
is<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> dig<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:31.439> block<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.890> each<00:00:32.399> segment

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
is you dig one block up each segment

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.549 
is you dig one block up each segment
like<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.480> you'll<00:00:33.780> end<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:33.989> walking<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.469> like

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
like this you'll end up walking up like

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.740 
like this you'll end up walking up like
that<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.190> find<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> way<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> another<00:00:36.480> cave<00:00:36.780> um

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
that and find a way to another cave um

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.639 
that and find a way to another cave um
but<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.079> find<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> safest<00:00:41.100> way<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
but I find the safest way to do this is

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
but I find the safest way to do this is
find<00:00:43.649> yourself<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.129> area<00:00:44.460> where<00:00:44.789> there's<00:00:45.090> not

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
find yourself an area where there's not

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
find yourself an area where there's not
really<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.399> like<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> end<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
really much going on like the end of a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
really much going on like the end of a
cave<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.030> something<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.590> you're

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
cave or something like that what you're

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
cave or something like that what you're

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that you'll back up you'll know that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.260 
that you'll back up you'll know that
above<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:35.040> lava<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:35.850> sand

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
above you there's lava water sand

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.630 
above you there's lava water sand
whatever<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.829> able<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> dig

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
whatever and you'll be able to dig

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.280 
whatever and you'll be able to dig
around<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.270> dig<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.840> way<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
around it like dig the other way and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.630 
around it like dig the other way and
then<00:01:40.500> dig<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:42.840> keep<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.640> like

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
then dig back up just keep going up like

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.539 
then dig back up just keep going up like
this<00:01:45.439> make<00:01:46.439> sure<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.680> hold<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.009> shift<00:01:47.310> key

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this make sure you hold your shift key

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.920 
this make sure you hold your shift key
so<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.909> fall<00:01:48.119> off<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> ledge<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> fall

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
so you don't fall off the ledge and fall

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
so you don't fall off the ledge and fall
down<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.350> because<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.040> wouldn't<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.310> very

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
down there because that wouldn't be very

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.890 
down there because that wouldn't be very
good<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:54.799> eventually

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
good and eventually

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:32.900
