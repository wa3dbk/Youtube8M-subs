00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.769
 hello i am rijn and this is on the cup 500 totally meaning and that makes floss 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.439
 unnecessary 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.199
 if we have the 500 full of sex in the package then we see 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.419
 here the charger the user manual and just proof of warranty with the online 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.559
 registration code and of course flossing thaksin them off 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.070
 The on a 500 of course has a timer function to all current 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.580
 brush evenly and stop pulsing if you drug too hard thanks to the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.630
 invisible but with this polished pressure sensor 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.840
 it can therefore also be used with other brushes 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.990
 but this version is called so thanks to this is the included rob devos package obs 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.330
 the brush 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.450
 lawyers on the off button 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.080
 and this is an indicator light for the moment it is being charged 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.280
 and on the back and that is very handy 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 a brutal stunt 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.350
 Well, turning it on naturally speaks for itself by pressing this button 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.550
 and then we can very nicely see the officers' pulsating and rotating function 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.360
 put the cards 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.090
 then we can simply pull the brush off in this way and you 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 Then let's see we are the micro pulse bristles because these worry 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.500
 namely the perfect chest 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.860
 they turn neatly around the edge and get all sticky because also between you 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.800
 teeth 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.100
 this on b500 comes exclusively with the flos ex je a brush 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 and furthermore the market has speed 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 the grain b500 ex impulse certainly had twice as much stickiness as an ordinary one 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.869
 toothbrush and thanks to this special relaying ex a brush is according to the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 guess past tense 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.280
 are you looking for your toothbrush that makes the foxes superfluous then 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 granule remained loose specs their a very good choice the honor this on b500 flos as 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.780
