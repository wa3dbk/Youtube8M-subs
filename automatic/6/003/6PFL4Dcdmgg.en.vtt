00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:12.210
 if not even the general good you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.610
 that in principle as a veteran runner 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.230
 and expert in great turns that that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.449
 sorry for the times that I have to go down in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.860
 the tour for the falls you do have the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.350
 Turn Spain on the calendar 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.840
 if we always stay except asturias 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.270
 and rest a little bit I'll prepare it 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.560
 the good return because there you can mess it up 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.290
 last year the team that already had you 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.180
 you were the victory of antonio piedra and 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.010
 we also said it here I create with your 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.600
 directors with the genius and with garzon is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.460
 that it's almost easier to win stages in the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.230
 back here is that here is not given 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.690
 nothing any day and in such short stages 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.340
 it goes to knife but in spite of everything you have 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.559
 tried on the getaways and that from 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.480
 then there is an exhibit left and that 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.390

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.590
 better time than the parade so 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.840
 both in the general porte now 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 would be the leader but eye that quintana the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.090
 is rolling 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.710
 marking 28 seconds better the truth 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780

 bird of cycling thoroughly and that in this 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.310
 case then in that alliance with us 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.649
 has brought us through a bus 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.880
 reach one I know confess my 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.750
 surprise when we thought of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.910
 n 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.650
 in bliss and as a favorite the north 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.040
 the one that is doing quintana the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.350
 awesome awesome nominal now 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.010
 look is that it is in time there 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 tony martin has 200 meters left 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.140
 which is 20 seconds longer than it is 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.030
 doing now 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.290
 but Martin is not going to fall but he's going 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.400
 to be second in the stage 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.410
 nairo quintana second in the stage 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 impressive and with this sentence the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 back to cyclist to the Basque country tremendous 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.530
 not from nairo quintana 35 22 to only 17 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.160
 seconds from tony martin let's go is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.860
 sensational in the benefits of nairo 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.680
 quintana a great climber but what 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.220
 Well, in a tremendous way, he has already won 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.010
 at the top of clear arrate but here 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.320
 Well man we always give a little more 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.120
 favorite to that amount for the time 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.840
 to defend the leadership but from 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.310
 then we go here the attraction 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 in the congratulations that you are giving 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 everybody conceptas with with 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.340
 scanner with the masseur soria also 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.500
 also cyclist announcing 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.940
 I do not know if the Alicante died 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.940
 be the chaco but we go from that area 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.740
 raise your hand the one who thought that 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.360
 quintana could do this the 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.660
 Today almost win against the tony 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.150
 Martin or what he does is be fit 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.800
 besides, in principle, he was not going to come 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.780
 the return to the Basque country because it crushes 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.030
 but he had already proven that he had 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.770
 a very good condition 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.050
 in the races he had played and 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.959
 here we go to sergio henao in the last 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.920
 kilometer that was one kilometer takes 34 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.920
 41 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.500
 which will significantly exceed the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.500
 Nairo Quintana 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 a tremendous time has been made a new 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.310
 often piece of corridor and so is capable 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.830
 of a journey that was also demanding 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.590
 not that there were his rises but already in the 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.240
 first partial exceeded half of the time 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.240
 in 5 seconds said amount 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.350
 candidate is not more favorite for the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.950
 been in a way that was accredited 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.740
 and certainly 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.690
 it would be a miracle it will not lose 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.920
 with sergio is not the leader comes the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.810
 sergio nao time and it is until two 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.020
 phases of lessons we are not going to sing it 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.130
 but it is the virtual winner of the return 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.000
 to the Basque country 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.280
 with 22 years old a climber that goes to 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.970
 find the phenomenal 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.970
 tremendous 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.480
 yesterday with movistar working for the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.580
 wear of 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.430
 of skype did not get it on stage 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.990
 yesterday but maybe if they got 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.849
 that his legs hurt a lot 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.910
 richie porte no 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:26.960
 but of course the time 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.140
 but 1 3602 for the agra is worth it either 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.990
 it's wrong but so much fifth second in 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.930
 the stage and wins the spectacular general 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.610
 what of the Nairo quintana with 93 ha 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.090
 fulfilled and recently lost in a 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.090
 February since the year 90 Nairo Quintana 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:51.199
 but it left us hallucinated 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.750
 but well it's also the first 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.039
 Colombian in winning this race is the 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.270
 first Colombian to win the round 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.030
 cyclist to the Basque country 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.310
 nairo quintana 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.720
 and also on his own merits he has won 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.180
 the stage can be said that better known 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.980
 the classic arrate with more ports 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.630
 long 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.390
 always in a heads-up with the 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.650
 great favorites and today because 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.639
 I was Tony Martin 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.110
 there are two seconds is it is tremendous at 17 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.860
 seconds of the world champion 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.069

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.639
