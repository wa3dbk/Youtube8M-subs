00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.240
 falls to him the gfl playoffs 2010 at gf 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.720
 ltv are presented to you by power 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720
 material 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.920
 the gfl semifinals between the kiel 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.960
 baltic hurricanes and the dresden 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.610
 Monarchs had to due to the bad 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.860
 weather in the team not as planned in the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.260
 holstein stadium will be held 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.530
 but on the maur pond had the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.540
 after her name all honor made in 1450 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.520
 Spectators had come to this match 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.120
 to see and they first saw the keel 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.840
 baltic hurricanes in the attack case 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.730
 handing over this end to the receiver 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 Damien Linson makes five years 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.579
 falls rudely but on it goes new 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.580
 quarterback now in the wildcat 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.619
 formation children long esther came 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.680
 from the arena football league is running here 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.430
 for 15 years he is another 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.729
 attack option for the kieler end of 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.259
 Attack series one year before the endzone 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.229
 jermaine all walked through the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.160
 defense of monarchs and canes 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.590
 lead with seven to zero so we look 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.020
 that's her on the dresden monarchs 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.860
 first of ants move in this game 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.510
 kapfenberg jake christensen and the pass 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.159
 was intercepted by wholegrain it was a 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.770
 sign for what should come 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.549
 for the dresdner on if they are now 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.470
 first the kieler again in ball possession 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:53.270
 dominant tried not win any room 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.450
 then the attack of the dresdner on the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.560
 field handover to michael andrew that it 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.600
 even a year's loss at the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.659
 series of attacks were in the course of the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 Partie harder and harder on the deep 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.519
 to get started right then 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.459
 but good attack series for the kieler 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.620
 again and again mirror always 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.159
 gain relatively little space 45 6 years 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.659
 as well as simon sommerfeld 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.000
 We have to finish the first quarter 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.450
 determine the moore pond meadows more 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 pond as a moore or meadow a touchdown 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.810
 There was not for the kieler but 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.939
 a field goal try julian 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.500
 Dohrendorf 35 yards but the kick was 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.170
 Of course, it's really hard for them 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.019
 Conditions of the kit is not good 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.700
 look again at the dresdner 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.590
 maybe it's almost ball now 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.690
 Handover to the jeff wall 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.250
 Indians, the kieler defense is surprised 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.250
 31 yards gain in space 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.890
 it continues now with the matching game 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.139
 Christensen was really hard 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.959
 under the conditions here is jeff 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:06.819
 wall in for six years but also this one 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.659
 Attack series does not lead to the 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.159
 endzone 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.170
 because michael andrew gets here the 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.319
 Ball runs into the puddle Rhine becomes 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.760
 stopped 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.959
 no space gain and that means now 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.909
 Of course, above all, jan 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.909
 hilgenfeldt has to leave 42 yards distance 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.819
 and kick out of the puddle and that is 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.470
 as you know, quite difficult and 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.629
 accordingly far kicked next to it 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.720
 also at the posts over here too 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.480
 no points offensively everything else 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.250
 We're watching a spectacular game 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.470
 again on the hosts end of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.329
 first half pass from welsh 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.329
 Lens that in 13 yards space gain 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.819
 but the whole ends with this run of 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.709
 jermaine all the defense in the defense 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.959
 the dresdner rows lose the ball 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.049
 markus thunder conquers him for the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.299
 monarchs and thus secures his team 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.069
 a short break only seven 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.069
 to zero for the host 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.070
 at the Rhine in the second passage 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.650
 two place finish the first 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.410
 attack series that is the third 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.000
 Christensen will have her incomplete 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.100
 as I said really hard 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.080
 to find the timing in the play station 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.850
 dresdner matching that was so good in the 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.010
 Last week was completely gone too 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.660
 pass is incomplete little interest 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.480
 balance sheet at the end of the lot three of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.670
 thirteen for lousy 19 years so that 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.260
 It was surprising and then he rolls 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.560
 free yourself here 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.990
 linz and finds great action from kieler 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.450
 quarterback was the usual and effective 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.790
 this attack series then also completed 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.440
 from 35 yards distance to julian 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.050
 Dohrendorf 35 yards so to the touchdown 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.870
 14,000 the balance of welles 17 of 22 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.330
 400 74 yards a touchdown no 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.450
 interception as in the best sunshine 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.340
 and the misses from the week before 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.710
 forget the quarterfinals at welsh 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.120
 into the fourth force now had the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.480
 dresdner come and she came with the 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.820
 running game this is michael andrew 39 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.880
 years drag through the middle andrew the 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.740
 best dresdner overall 117 then runs 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.840
 but led trial and six 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.000
 But then christiansen moment will be 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.000
 but said by erin badu 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.189
 and shortly thereafter came the last 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.289
 chance of dresden monarchs and you 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.939
 put back on the running game that is 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.009
 michael andrew himself by it 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.460
 the middle powered for 14 years 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.460
 space profit 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.759
 but the kieler defense used to be good almost 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.039
 even better than usual we are in 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.900
 fourth try 8 yards to go pass 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:54.389
 christian are not at the 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.029
 Throw is incomplete and strikes 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.389
 kiel dresden with 4 10 to 0 and is 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:02.340
 for the third time in a row in german 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.199
 bowl now is the goal, however 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.199
 finally the thing to win 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.819
 but then there are two more 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:17.189
 weeks and for so long can men 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.180
 still children are good the most open very 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:19.770
 bad in the game we have immediately 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.599
 thrown first playern interception 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.310
 she fell as and fell behind 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.740
 Stand defender had made the way 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.210
 So far, the open is the 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.370
 running after the fans today 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.279
 you really have to open your ass 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.479
 already say in the weather and we 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.759
 had really weak spots open 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.870
 quite simply you can never say so 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.029
 think the chances for both teams 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.379
 because it could have overturned either way 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.599
 problem is that under these conditions 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.190
 Count a lot of big plays or just 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.729
 once a receiver fell down comeback 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.289
 fell 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.460
 So that's not very easy 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.690
 good for football are playing for 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.789
 spectators it was not interesting the 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.169
 fans become more beautiful between the big ones 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.810
 always logical but otherwise 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.580
 Kiel has dominated us today in all 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.159
 possible areas and congratulations 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.360
 kiel and a lot of success in the job then want 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.460
 Let's see how it will be next year 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.719
 then of course, if you go in 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.960
 the towers castle have that very much 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.939
 Satisfied just delivered she has the 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.860
 same incredible played today pass 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.169
 ingame von dresden was not really 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.759
 we have a few existing offensively 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.240
 chances are a few big plays out there 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.430
 calmly 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.960
 have but if we need to make space 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.029
 In that sense I am satisfied 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.520
 This short-term move has been on 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:25.589
 the murderous act had a kind of fire play 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.330
 impacted because it must be logistical 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.889
 a lot be done and he is 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.349
 different frame conditions than in woodland 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.139
 stadium , of course, was logistical 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:36.349
 but probably a lot going on 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.210
 We as a team do not care about where we are 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:40.009
 play dresden where we play 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.270
 germany starts on the verdict 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:46.189
 showed the kiel baltic hurricanes profit 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.080
 her semi final with 14 10 against the 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.999
 dresden monarchs and stand on 9 october 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.849
 at Frankfurt's commerzbank arena 

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:55.219
 18:30 against the berlin eagle in german 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:56.479
 bowl elected ev logs in like the 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:57.259
 next week then with the 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.969
 summary of the two 

00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:02.080
 climbing games in the gfl 

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:02.080
 until then, they are doing well
