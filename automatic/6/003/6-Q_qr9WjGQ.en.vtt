00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.870
 and nothing more 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.619
 one of the most prolific franchises in 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.080
 the history of video games is without 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.550
 doubt the melgar after a quick look 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.259
 to the past it is clear that the intention 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.090
 of hideo kojima is to provide a 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.279
 different experience this is about the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.199
 same game thanks to that each one 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.000
 has a different identity since 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.860
 the 8- bit graphics that invited us 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.689
 to explore aurore heaven going through the 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.820
 stealthy experience in shadow moses in 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.280
 male solid and even survival like 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.960
 such in mere war 3 snake eater the saga 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.399
 has never stopped its evolution so 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.989
 that the announcement of brown news and the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.789
 phantom pain awaken a great 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.410
 expectation about how it will be presented 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.360
 this new mission that will put us 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.489
 again behind the storm don 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.890
 late snake better known as ' big 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.540
 boats' best ground sybase presents a 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.489
 completely different game mode 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.380
 so much that we dare to say that it is 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.239
 the most dynamic and intuitive of all the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.460
 series in addition to taking a step to a new 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.160
 evolution in the graphic aspect with the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.469
 use of the fox engine rounds and eggs is the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.269
 prologue to mere virtuality 5 the phantom 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.159
 pain located a few years after the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.930
 peace walker big box events 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.820
 returns to the battlefield in order 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.249
 to infiltrate a military base where 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.259
 boy and peace are captives the 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.620
 history of this prologue although short is 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.660
 whatever 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 wait for a game of hideo kojima in 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.470
 which intense moments and changes in the 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.390
 plot will be the order of the day although 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.130
 the dialogue and the narrative seem to be 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.170
 a little below other deliveries 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.120
 grandes y rose fulfills its mission to the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 make us feel impatient to play 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.020
 the phantom pain the dose of humor that 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.730
 characterizes the saga will be present in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 some of the extra ops with some 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.480
 ex sister and fan service especially in 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 the missions of javu and call book 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.930
 same that we will unlock after obtaining 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.940
 the patches of the software unit 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.660
 during the main mission for another 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.610
 side 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.220
 kiefer sutherland joins the wave of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.990
 changes that it poses -5 replacing 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.660
 David Spin who made the voice of Snake 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.790
 since 1998 although it will be difficult to convince 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.560
 to the most nostalgic and hardened fans 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.600
 of hitler the role of suderland as big 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.580
 boss' works generally fine though 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.170
 at times his raspy voice sounds something 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.270
 forced and will contrast with the dialogues 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.690
 to which they apply a tone of voice more 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.690
 normal 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.349
 unlike the last deliveries the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.970
 history does not have the typical 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.010
 Video sequences of more than 10 minutes 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 but they are perfectly 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.580
 balanced in order to offer the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.770
 context of the story without getting bored or 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 overwhelm us for more than five minutes the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.190
 map where the mission will be located is 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.110
 relatively large in which the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.760
 lighting and the terrain will play a 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.530
 important role in the development of 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 game there will always be new zones by 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 explore and various collectibles we 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.290
 they will repeat the same mission 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.910
 again and again unfortunately we 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.470
 we will feel very limited by the fact of 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.970
 that both the main mission and the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.230
 secondary will be carried out in the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 same place although the weather and the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.290
 lighting will change depending on the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.150
 mission the location will go from being 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.739
 entertaining to monotonous after a few 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.180
 how many hours of play to be worse 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.650
 this situation most of the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.269
 secondary missions feel 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.890
 inconsequential and unattractive 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.180
 independently of the different 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.130
 possibilities that we have for 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.870
 complete them does not offer any kind of 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.580
 variety of what I could see in the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.410
 main mission the gameplay is more 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.700
 flexible dynamic and very intuitive 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.530
 presenting a style of play 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.970
 completely in real time that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.769
 it replaces most of the elements 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.769
 common in other melody games 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.660
 the map will not be displayed on the screen 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.520
 but we will have to press start 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 to see it from our android the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.910
 intrusive calls by codec will be 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.170
 replaced with radio calls that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.300
 we will listen in real time while 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.950
 we play finally elements so 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.230
 classic like the cardboard box or 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 rations will not appear otherwise 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.500
 that many may think the absence of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.910
 these elements will not affect the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 experience of infiltration that 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.750
 raises this new medium since the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.459
 game design will make us adapt to 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.840
 the simple but important changes with 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.400
 those that count the controls are 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.140
 completely adapted to the style of 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.150
 so fluid game that presents great 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.459
 shows and they feel even better than 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.110
 of network solid 4 intelligence 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.610
 artificial of the enemies has improved 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.350
 drastically except for the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.880
 short- term memory that they enjoy 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.680
 all the soldiers in the history of 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.020
 melo aller his behavior we 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.489
 will surprise on many occasions not 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.200
 matter how expert they are in the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.910
 infiltration missions the absence of 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.650
 the vision cones of the enemy and a 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.390
 map forces us to trust in our 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 instincts besides they are now 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.989
 able to see us from far away what 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.890
 which will make us think twice about our 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.890
 way to approach 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.030
 there will also be rare occasions when 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.949
 You can see us through a tiny opening 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.539
 or even through boxes or doors what 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.100
 which throws away the potential of 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.930
 artificial intelligence and they make the 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.419
 infiltration in the field omega a 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.740
 rather frustrating experience the game 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.330
 presents us with several options that we 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.100
 help at the beginning like the use of 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.780
 binoculars to mark the enemies and 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.759
 in this way see its location in the 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.020
 map to the reflex mode that will put the 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.000
 action in slow motion when we are 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.320
 discovered giving us opportunity to 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.710
 counterattack before the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.710
 alarms 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.380
 although they are details that are appreciated 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.000
 principle and they could make the 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.680
 game the design of the mission is very 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.510
 balanced doing kenny with this 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.160
 help is impossible to go unnoticed 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.200
 all the time or being able to counterattack with 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.730
 success the graphic aspect that the 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.440
 fox engine is surprising the 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.060
 lighting and climate are like never before 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.650
 besides that the level of detail in the 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.410
 stage and the characters are seen with a 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.310
 photo level spectacular realism 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.710
 unfortunately the versions for 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.300
 Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 do not manage to look 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.160
 not at all the capabilities of this 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.810
 new graphic engine wasting the 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.160
 opportunity and being disadvantaged in 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.050
 compared to versions for 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.120
 new generation consoles especially 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.680
 with the playstation 4 although we 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.510
 It will take approximately 2 hours for 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.220
 complete the main mission and other 2 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.320
 for the secondary missions the time 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.490
 of play increases considerably if it is 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.200
 that we want to get all the 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.400
 collectibles and pass all the 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.320
 missions in the two difficulties 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.760
 available if they are not of the type 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.500
 players who like to squeeze until the 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.000
 last drop of games or prefer 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.190
 just experience the story that it offers 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.960
 this title probably ground shows 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.820
 do not have much to offer them but the 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.890
 ground silver prepares the ground for 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.870
 the phantom pain that will undoubtedly be something 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.490
 completely bigger and interesting 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.230
 although the experience with this prologue 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.790
 it is satisfactory in terms 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.780
 general, the price is higher than 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.640
 content that he offers us 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.110
 regardless of the duration without 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.840
 But the horizon for the new 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.190
 mission of big boats looks promising with 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.570
 seen in ground singles we can 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.280
 confirm that the development for the 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.170
 next title of mere aller goes by 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.700
 good way as long as they get better 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.030
 the little details that this presents 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.030
 Foreword
