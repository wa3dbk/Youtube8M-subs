show you how did the easiest easiest fix
for<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.179> light<00:00:15.509> that's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.289> screw<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.650> top<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
for a light that's a screw on top that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.340 
for a light that's a screw on top that
keeps<00:00:17.630> accidentally<00:00:19.310> activating<00:00:20.310> itself<00:00:20.730> as

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
keeps accidentally activating itself as

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.859 
keeps accidentally activating itself as
this<00:00:22.350> used<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.330> fifteen

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this used to do this was about fifteen

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.490 
this used to do this was about fifteen
dollars<00:00:26.330> now<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.630> there's<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> spring<00:00:28.230> there

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
dollars now I see there's a spring there

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.179 
dollars now I see there's a spring there
and<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:30.619> it's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:31.769> powerful

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and it's a very it's a very powerful

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.479 
and it's a very it's a very powerful
spring<00:00:33.890> which<00:00:34.890> causes<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:37.489> accidentally

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
spring which causes this to accidentally

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.959 
spring which causes this to accidentally
activate<00:00:39.059> itself<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.200> super<00:00:40.649> bright<00:00:40.969> now

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
activate itself it's super bright now

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
activate itself it's super bright now
the<00:00:42.030> problem<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the problem with this is that if you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.430 
the problem with this is that if you
accidentally<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.579> push<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
accidentally just push down on that it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.459 
accidentally just push down on that it
activates<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> had<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.870> inside

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
activates so if you had this like inside

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.340 
activates so if you had this like inside
a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.640> survival<00:00:51.120> kit<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> something<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
a little survival kit or something and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.240 
a little survival kit or something and
you<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.550> UM<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.270> tightly<00:00:54.570> packed<00:00:55.250> it's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you had to UM it's tightly packed it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.639 
you had to UM it's tightly packed it's
going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> accidentally<00:00:57.030> activate<00:00:57.660> itself<00:00:58.020> or

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going to accidentally activate itself or

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
going to accidentally activate itself or
if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.850> pocket<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
if you just have it in your pocket and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
if you just have it in your pocket and
it<00:01:00.600> brushes<00:01:00.870> against<00:01:01.320> something<00:01:01.649> it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it brushes against something it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.990 
it brushes against something it's
activating<00:01:03.270> itself<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.489> order<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
activating itself and in order to make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.359 
activating itself and in order to make
it<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> unscrew<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it not do that you have to unscrew it so

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
it not do that you have to unscrew it so
much<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.170> it's<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.010> there

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
much that it's not even on there

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
much that it's not even on there
securely<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.110> fix<00:01:13.470> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
securely so how do we fix this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
securely so how do we fix this
activation<00:01:14.430> problem<00:01:15.240> well<00:01:17.479> basically<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
activation problem well basically this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.300 
activation problem well basically this
has<00:01:19.350> an<00:01:19.799> o-ring<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
has an o-ring but it's a pretty it's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.410 
has an o-ring but it's a pretty it's
just<00:01:23.640> too<00:01:23.700> thin<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.259> need<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
just too thin so all you need to do is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.039 
just too thin so all you need to do is
add<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.750> few<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.650> o<00:01:28.860> rings<00:01:29.570> okay<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.900> I've

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
added two o-rings there and that's the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.580 
added two o-rings there and that's the
one<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.810> came<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:35.329> now<00:01:36.329> many<00:01:36.689> many<00:01:36.960> little

and now if I press on this you see it is
not<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.979> not<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> activate<00:02:00.149> because

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
not it is not going to activate because

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.969 
not it is not going to activate because
those<00:02:01.350> prevent<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.960> depressing<00:02:03.979> unless

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
those prevent it from depressing unless

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.550 
those prevent it from depressing unless
I<00:02:05.159> really<00:02:05.399> screw<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:07.160> like<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.550> oh<00:02:09.560> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
I really screw it down like so oh and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860 
I really screw it down like so oh and
this<00:02:10.649> tape<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.310> grip<00:02:11.849> tape<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.540> because

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
this tape this grip tape is just because

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.670 
this tape this grip tape is just because
this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.230> smooth

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this is smooth

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
this is smooth
so<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:13.980> gives<00:02:14.159> me<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.400> better<00:02:14.640> grip<00:02:15.379> okay<00:02:16.379> so

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
so that gives me a better grip okay so

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.380 
so that gives me a better grip okay so
that's<00:02:16.799> just<00:02:16.890> an<00:02:17.189> easy<00:02:17.459> fix<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:18.090> make<00:02:18.359> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
that's just an easy fix to make a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.530 
that's just an easy fix to make a
fifteen<00:02:18.959> dollar<00:02:18.989> light<00:02:19.590> usable<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:21.359> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
fifteen dollar light usable and this is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.369 
fifteen dollar light usable and this is
a<00:02:21.569> very<00:02:21.870> nice<00:02:22.200> light<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:23.390> very<00:02:24.390> compact<00:02:25.049> this

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
a very nice light it's very compact this

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.110 
a very nice light it's very compact this
is<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> nightcore<00:02:26.810> comparable<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.930> size<00:02:27.959> to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
is a nightcore comparable in size to

bright light okay what you're seeing
right<00:03:49.229> now<00:03:49.439> is<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:50.189> high<00:03:50.400> mode<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:51.479> going<00:03:51.900> to

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
right now is the high mode I'm going to

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.539 
right now is the high mode I'm going to
switch<00:03:52.259> it<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.150> medium<00:03:54.150> mode<00:03:55.159> ok<00:03:56.159> this<00:03:56.340> is

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
switch it to the medium mode ok this is

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.119 
switch it to the medium mode ok this is
the<00:03:56.729> medium<00:03:57.209> mode<00:03:57.569> yeah<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.439> think<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.949> see

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
the medium mode yeah I think you can see

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.399 
the medium mode yeah I think you can see
the<00:03:59.280> difference<00:03:59.669> there<00:03:59.849> man<00:04:00.090> even<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.900> medium

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
the difference there man even the medium

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.610 
the difference there man even the medium
mode<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:02.040> pretty<00:04:02.970> bright<00:04:03.329> all<00:04:04.169> right<00:04:04.259> now<00:04:04.530> I'm

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
mode is pretty bright all right now I'm

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.210 
mode is pretty bright all right now I'm
going<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.859> switch<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> strobe<00:04:05.959> mode<00:04:07.220> so

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
going to switch it to the strobe mode so

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.490 
going to switch it to the strobe mode so
don't<00:04:08.459> watch<00:04:08.699> this<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.750> you're<00:04:09.959> sensitive<00:04:10.379> to

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
don't watch this if you're sensitive to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.030 
don't watch this if you're sensitive to
stroke<00:04:11.040> fair<00:04:11.549> warning<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.709> this<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.889> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
stroke fair warning and this is the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.689 
stroke fair warning and this is the
strobe<00:04:14.400> effect<00:04:15.560> we're<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.709> disco<00:04:17.220> man<00:04:17.489> as

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
strobe effect we're at a disco man as

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.509 
strobe effect we're at a disco man as
you<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.690> see<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.829> would<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.220> quite

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
you can see this would be quite

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.700 
you can see this would be quite
disorienting<00:04:20.970> being<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.079> receiving<00:04:22.200> end

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
disorienting being on the receiving end

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.750 
disorienting being on the receiving end
of<00:04:22.889> this<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.849> strobe<00:04:24.210> effect<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:26.340> right<00:04:26.520> there

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
of this so strobe effect all right there

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.590 
of this so strobe effect all right there
