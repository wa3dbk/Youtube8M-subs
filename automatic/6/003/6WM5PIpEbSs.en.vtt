why does this whole world why do I have

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.439 
why does this whole world why do I have

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
to do with these kids why can't I just

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.689 
to do with these kids why can't I just
write<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.199> be<00:03:41.229> at<00:03:41.470> peace<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:42.009> so<00:03:42.280> that's<00:03:42.549> why

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
write and be at peace and so that's why

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.460 
write and be at peace and so that's why
he<00:03:42.849> got<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.180> out<00:03:43.239> by<00:03:43.629> having<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:44.049> struggling

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
he got that out by having a struggling

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.649 
he got that out by having a struggling
writer<00:03:44.739> who<00:03:45.519> kind<00:03:45.759> of<00:03:45.849> hates<00:03:46.060> his<00:03:46.239> children

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
writer who kind of hates his children

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.240 
writer who kind of hates his children
and<00:03:46.750> actually<00:03:47.079> breaks<00:03:47.349> their<00:03:47.560> arm<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.979> stuff

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
and actually breaks their arm and stuff

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.990 
and actually breaks their arm and stuff
and<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.699> in<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.569> one<00:03:50.400> Stephen<00:03:51.400> King<00:03:51.609> was

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and so in this one Stephen King was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.909 
and so in this one Stephen King was
actually<00:03:52.569> an<00:03:52.689> English<00:03:52.900> teacher<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.709> while

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
actually an English teacher for a while

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.999 
actually an English teacher for a while
and<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.549> really<00:03:54.759> feels<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.389> this<00:03:55.599> is<00:03:56.009> the

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
and so it really feels like this is the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.679 
and so it really feels like this is the
struggles<00:03:57.519> he<00:03:57.579> had<00:03:57.849> as<00:03:58.060> an<00:03:58.239> English<00:03:58.659> teacher

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
struggles he had as an English teacher

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.149 
struggles he had as an English teacher
