00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
Call of Duty is so far into the future

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.789 
Call of Duty is so far into the future
now<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:31.729> we're<00:01:32.299> where's<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.049> gonna<00:01:33.109> go<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.680> it

now that we're where's it gonna go is it
is<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.000> risk<00:01:35.210> going<00:01:35.659> all<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.020> way

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
is it going to risk going all the way

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.410 
is it going to risk going all the way
back<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.590> past<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.130> don't<00:01:37.789> know<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.030> feel

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
back to the past I don't know I feel

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.990 
back to the past I don't know I feel
like<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.229> audience<00:01:39.679> for<00:01:39.859> Call<00:01:40.039> of<00:01:40.070> Duty<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.579> a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
like the audience for Call of Duty is a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.899 
like the audience for Call of Duty is a
younger<00:01:41.750> audience<00:01:41.780> now<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.740> since<00:01:43.700> they<00:01:43.850> do

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
younger audience now and since they do

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.660 
younger audience now and since they do
this<00:01:44.299> every<00:01:44.479> year<00:01:44.979> it's<00:01:45.979> really<00:01:46.429> gonna<00:01:46.579> be

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
this every year it's really gonna be

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.419 
this every year it's really gonna be
hard<00:01:47.030> for<00:01:47.240> them<00:01:47.359> to<00:01:47.439> create<00:01:48.439> something<00:01:48.829> fresh

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
hard for them to create something fresh

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.700 
hard for them to create something fresh
and<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:50.030> think<00:01:50.240> futuristic<00:01:51.079> shooters<00:01:51.469> are

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
and I think futuristic shooters are

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.279 
and I think futuristic shooters are
fresh<00:01:52.249> in<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.609> way<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:53.509> they<00:01:53.659> can<00:01:53.719> just<00:01:54.020> create

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
fresh in a way that they can just create

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.510 
fresh in a way that they can just create
anything<00:01:54.729> from<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.850> whim<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.499> I<00:01:57.499> think<00:01:57.979> if<00:01:58.189> they

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
anything from a whim and I think if they

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.099 
anything from a whim and I think if they
were<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.939> do<00:01:59.060> something<00:01:59.090> successful<00:02:00.020> they

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
were to do something successful they

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.859 
were to do something successful they
could<00:02:00.350> create<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.979> fantasy<00:02:01.310> world<00:02:01.789> war<00:02:02.509> two

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
could create a fantasy world war two

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.870 
could create a fantasy world war two

it's a treyarch style but the thing is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.120 
it's a treyarch style but the thing is
it<00:02:26.060> seems<00:02:26.300> like<00:02:26.450> treyarch<00:02:27.080> style<00:02:27.380> mixed<00:02:27.920> with

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
it seems like treyarch style mixed with

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.440 
it seems like treyarch style mixed with
a<00:02:28.430> lot<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.709> Activision<00:02:30.709> influence

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
a lot of Activision influence

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.000 
a lot of Activision influence
and<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.780> fact<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.140> they're<00:02:33.680> probably

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and the fact that they're probably

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.770 
and the fact that they're probably
started<00:02:34.520> developing<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.090> team<00:02:35.330> during

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
started developing this team during

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.680 
started developing this team during
titanfall's<00:02:36.410> hype<00:02:36.920> when<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.760> was<00:02:37.910> starting

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
titanfall's hype when that was starting

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.960 
titanfall's hype when that was starting
to<00:02:38.780> get<00:02:38.900> released<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.500> talked<00:02:39.769> about<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
to get released and talked about and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.040 
to get released and talked about and
they're<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.300> man<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:41.660> should<00:02:41.810> create

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
they're like man we should create

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.690 
they're like man we should create
something<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.379> will<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> direct

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
something that will be a direct

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.259 
something that will be a direct
competition<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.870> titanfall<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:46.670> don't

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
competition to titanfall and I don't

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.170 
competition to titanfall and I don't
know<00:02:47.390> why<00:02:47.569> titanfall<00:02:48.050> did<00:02:48.890> okay<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:50.060> it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
know why titanfall did okay but it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.030 
know why titanfall did okay but it
didn't<00:02:50.390> do<00:02:50.480> as<00:02:50.630> good<00:02:50.690> as<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.050> think<00:02:51.110> titanfall

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
didn't do as good as I think titanfall

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.330 
didn't do as good as I think titanfall
creators<00:02:52.610> thought<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.599> was<00:02:53.690> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.019> and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
creators thought it was going to do and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.710 
creators thought it was going to do and
I<00:02:55.340> think<00:02:55.700> that's<00:02:55.849> what's<00:02:56.120> gonna<00:02:56.239> happen<00:02:56.330> with

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
I think that's what's gonna happen with

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.289 
I think that's what's gonna happen with
black<00:02:56.930> ops<00:02:57.170> 3<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.860> lot<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.519> people<00:02:58.640> were<00:02:58.819> hoping

black ops 3 a lot of people were hoping

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.789 
black ops 3 a lot of people were hoping
that<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.989> was<00:03:00.170> gonna<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> game<00:03:00.769> that

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
that this was gonna be the game that

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.250 
that this was gonna be the game that
saved<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.819> franchise<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.690> lot<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.140> people

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
saved the franchise a lot of people

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.559 
saved the franchise a lot of people
hated<00:03:03.650> ghosts<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.190> lot<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.849> people<00:03:04.970> were<00:03:05.360> like

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
to see us go and i think the simplicity

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.710 
to see us go and i think the simplicity
of<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.310> game<00:03:34.579> is<00:03:34.760> what<00:03:34.940> has<00:03:35.120> made<00:03:35.329> it<00:03:35.510> so

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
of that game is what has made it so

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.870 
of that game is what has made it so
successful<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.530> feel<00:03:36.739> like<00:03:36.769> what<00:03:37.220> call<00:03:37.730> of

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
successful and I feel like what call of

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.020 
successful and I feel like what call of
duty<00:03:37.910> is<00:03:38.150> doing<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.600> making<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:40.030> involved

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
duty is doing is making it so involved

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.740 
duty is doing is making it so involved
with<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.109> many<00:03:42.290> different<00:03:42.590> things<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.750> it's

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
with so many different things and I it's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.819 
with so many different things and I it's
nice<00:03:45.109> because<00:03:45.380> there's<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.680> lot<00:03:45.709> of

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
nice because there's a lot of

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.830 
nice because there's a lot of
customizations<00:03:46.579> like<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.880> can<00:03:47.060> customize

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
money as much as they possibly can from

money as much as they possibly can from
the<00:04:13.400> fans<00:04:13.700> at<00:04:14.030> least<00:04:14.510> that's<00:04:14.720> what<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.989> fans

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the fans at least that's what the fans

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.190 
the fans at least that's what the fans
probably<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:17.479> don't<00:04:17.720> know<00:04:17.900> it's

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
probably think and I don't know it's

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.879 
probably think and I don't know it's
really<00:04:18.410> hard<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.829> get<00:04:18.919> excited<00:04:19.070> because<00:04:19.639> I

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889
