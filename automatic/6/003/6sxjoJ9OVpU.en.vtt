00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.790
 most recently it was perfect 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.350
 secret object 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.890
 we are Zvenigorodskaya 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.310
 observatories of the Institute of Astronomy 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.509
 Russian Academy of Sciences 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.389
 clean forest air is just what 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.959
 necessary for success 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.129
 parties of all observation 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.639
 originally it is an observatory 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.470
 was created as 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 traffic 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.619
 defense Department 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 it's top secret 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 there is no trouble at least 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 market turnover 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.820
 we deal with the problem of asteroid 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.800
 comet hazard 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.300
 here and this tool and 60 meter 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.270
 we have a telescope 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.280
 for vacation for observation 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.470
 engaged in land 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.470
 polish 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.610
 larger bodies of meteor showers than we 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 We are engaged in the ninety-fifth year 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.300
 and here including him 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.010
 everyday 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 on the earth falls to lay from space 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.340
 Bolsheviks naturally falls 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.580
 less often the smallest smallest polynka 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.810
 penetrates dozens of lands every day 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.979
 kilos pebbles more flies 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.780
 atmosphere bright meteors 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.229
 there are invisibles the size of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.750
 baseball and less traitor 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.689
 evaporates 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.710
 they have absolutely 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 as for large wreckage 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.440
 up to one hundred meters diameter 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 the widow does not represent for us 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.220
 Sungari family about once a thousand 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 years old 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.920
 car crash 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.350
 more than one year 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 as such a rare event 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.720
 suitable size 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 however later 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.890
 in just the last 250 million years 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.250
 happened 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.000
 measure of non-living organisms 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.659
 middle straight 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.910
 it is not 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.340
 these disasters can 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.430
 by the way fall to the ground 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.430
 top three 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790
 always fell to the ground 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.180
 moon formation wins shock 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.870
 phenomena it happens constantly 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.529
 happening now 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.899
 of course he was more intense 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.829
 here are some times 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.109
 percentage away from us we are somewhere on 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.779
 billion on there 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.419
 they say billions of years when 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.559
 formed 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.819
 the largest craters are tens of kilometers away 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.999
 hundreds of kilometers 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.959
 child process 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.199
 a fallout i.e. a stream of meteorites 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.809
 but in the entire solar system it is not only 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.559
 touches the moon 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.469
 n at least the inside 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.629
 solar system concerns 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.869
 the flow of meteorites it gradually decreased 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.779
 new earth and the moon moving let's say here in 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.959
 this region is the Greeks of the earth 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.659
 they kind of swept out meteorites 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.599
 rotating in this area 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.889
 large 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.249
 and so now the fall of large 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.909
 meteorites 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.709
 but lulu is very rare 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.969
 every clear night astronomers observe 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.869
 movements of small celestial bodies 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:28.599
 so called health and 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.869
 characteristics of the orbit 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.289
 values ​​are recorded 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.829
 gastronomic catalog 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.299
 the probability of a collision of the earth with 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.460
 small celestial body is very small 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.669
 but absolutely not going 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.520
 now we have 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.859
 in circulation 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.859
 causes an asteroid 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.519
 99 945 it turns out 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.519
 melting proper apophis 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.169
 when it was discovered in it was full of people in 2004 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.199
 mn4 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.459
 this 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.179
 three hundred 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:02.329
 with pennies 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.739
 meter body categories 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.009
 which 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.479
 with a frequency of mine about seven 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.059
 years old 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.059
 percent 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.169
 there is a close approach to the ground 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.579
 and n20 ninth year 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.579
 we are getting closer than 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.199
 distance to the moon 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.749
 and in the sixth year, it will meet around 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.099
 land 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.029
 but this forecast will also be refined 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.040
 until 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.740
 the forecast gives an order of distance 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.139
 geostationary orbit 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.059
 at 240 this study 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:40.290
 but since 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.480
 there is no forecast for such 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.390
 a long period will not happen very much 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.050
 there is definitely a certain corridor of mistakes 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.460
 percent 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.460
 which says that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.189
 especially after the rendezvous twenty 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.560
 the ninth year it will be clear will face 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.529
 the quality of the year the earth did not become 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.150
 Friday April 13, 2029 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.000
 this day threatens to be fatal for 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.400
 all planet earth 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.620
 4 36 GMT asteroid apophis 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.620
 9 9 9 4 2 weight 50 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.990
 320 meters 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.029
 three flowing orbit 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.330
 land at a speed of 45 thousand 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.349
 in many guys 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.650
 will cost energy 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.650
 and national 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.289
 wipe out 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.279
 or shake a tsunami a couple of hundred meters 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.319
 tall 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.679
 and this is not a fantasy at all 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.439
 Hollywood script 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.309
 we study very carefully not only in 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.119
 worldwide celebrate determines 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:41.939
 lot prevention is determined by the exact 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.889
 The score is a fairly accurate definition of 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.249
 sizes 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.529
 percentage now we will get it 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.729
 the spectrum defines it as if 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.349
 particular physical and chemical features 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.639
 class he 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.189
 rest to a group of bodies 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.929
 applies large stone in summer more 

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.049
 iron affair may be this timid 

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:06.099
 put out the comet I think that he is like 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.400
 represents the end 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.789
 and that we face a collision with him 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.490
 it takes 3 sixth year a lot of time even 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.939
 you can still try 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.679
 if suddenly it turns out that in collisions with 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.569
 NATO 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.840
 that we try to avoid exposure 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.050
 any 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.289
 object detected 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.389
 Perm region is approaching the earth 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.819
 science fiction writers included astronomers 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.629
 agree that 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:35.650
 let only 2 8 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.599
 protection options 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.599
 object scum 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.740
 changing his party 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.880
 seriously discussed the question of introducing 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.979
 orbit 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:51.309
 first met her and she would be stuck 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:54.149
 on its surface reflects the sunny st 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:55.979
 fiction writes a lot about space 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.139
 ships capable of porting arrange 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.520
 wait and but for now in practice 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.110
 not one of the invented 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.870
 ways
