00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.450
 what's going on at the front 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 immigration reform and its discussion 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 nothing like that was worthy there 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.890
 some attention and not yet seen but 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.529
 there is a very interesting event which 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 directly or indirectly therefore I 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 here you wanted to tell you maybe 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.520
 heard that some time ago in the state 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.440
 arizona who suffers a lot from stage 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 limit mexico the state suffers a lot 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 from illegal immigrants and and in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.180
 criminal plan 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.129
 and economic then there went 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.300
 some laws were passed which 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 then something obama means 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.219
 challenged in the supreme court and there they canceled 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.949
 three very important elements for arizona 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.350
 of this law invalidated 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.159
 but 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.189
 there means that what was happening they 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.860
 recognized right 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.940
 demand something from people 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.500
 documents confirming that they are 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.899
 legally or illegally just by 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 suspicion of earlier gali if no yes 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.750
 let him if he got arrested or 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.759
 you can ask something 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.350
 league or not and just outside 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.600
 stop you can not started admitted that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.890
 it is possible and this is also a great achievement 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.590
 but here in what in thin it means this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.509
 arizona state she 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.060
 tried to deal with illegal 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.920
 immigrants personally that is here you are 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.500
 illegal migrant well come here 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.880
 deal with you and that's where everything is from 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:48.200
 I was now attempted by the states 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.319
 alabama in a similar direction but they 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.670
 said so well if here 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.440
 supreme court and everything is like a system in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.210
 Generally does not allow to deal with 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.580
 private person let's on the other hand 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.709
 let's go let's deal with those 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.770
 who promotes 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.320
 illegal immigration with those who 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.470
 imports there exploits some 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.299
 brokerage means there is exercising here with 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.680
 let's understand them and they 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.620
 prepared the reform and sent the supreme 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.840
 court 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.019
 Means on consideration of the case is that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.720
 here the problem is that the questions 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.080
 immigration in general and in general is in 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.810
 competency federal there is nothing 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.569
 this is not arranged for the states therefore 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 in general, in general, it was not clear what 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.920
 they counted but they count on 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 the fact that since the state of arizona something 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.760
 I managed to spend it there 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.890
 to be we now the other side will go in and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.420
 some state rights take over 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.329
 who may well be us federal 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.359
 power as it were resolved at the state level 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:02.489
 decide and now this game is not an offer 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.190
 it did not pass as a result 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.170
 the fact that he was discussed and said no 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.540
 we basically don't like that 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.640
 what do you suggest rejected them 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.879
 without discussing them 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.549
 rejected on the grounds that the state is not 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.819
 has such powers because on 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.620
 actually federal laws 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.380
 imply punishment 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.859
 persecution of people involved here 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.930
 this wait for traffic on illegal 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.239
 immigrants that is to bring them there 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.910
 across the border across the state there 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.959
 on the territory here or there already 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.599
 legislation 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.639
 that is, in guys say we are 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.350
 it's still doing something you don't need us 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.550
 do 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.440
 and on this basis they simply refused without 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.610
 discussions but i just want to say 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.920
 what does it show how illegal 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.730
 immigration worries a lot of states 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.910
 it over there 10 states want some 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.370
 its legislation on this topic because 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.600
 that already but there was simply no strength 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.940
 federal government she 's 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.260
 idle even when there are laws they 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.280
 not executed at all 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.430
 no punishment those who 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.560
 hires 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.760
 illegals are not in relation 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.799
 overlapping the border so that people do not 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.730
 could walk back and forth so freely 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.230
 General background on which we have today 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.410
 there is a discussion of immigration 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.190
 reforms 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.190
 and then we'll see
