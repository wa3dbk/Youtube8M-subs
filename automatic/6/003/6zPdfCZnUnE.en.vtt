00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
one of the most common questions we get

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.770 
one of the most common questions we get
is<00:00:47.339> how<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.519> I<00:00:47.610> pick<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.970> my<00:00:48.000> street<00:00:48.420> bike<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is how do I pick up my street bike the

thing is 5 600 pounds right so the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.720 
thing is 5 600 pounds right so the
technique<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.199> train<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.339> is<00:00:53.519> what<00:00:53.699> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
technique we train with is what I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.210 
technique we train with is what I
learned<00:00:54.030> becoming<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.659> BMW<00:00:55.290> instructors<00:00:55.860> using

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
leverage in the handlebar okay so I'll

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.340 
leverage in the handlebar okay so I'll
drop<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.309> bike<00:00:59.519> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> ground<00:01:00.030> carefully
