he had been convinced the blood loss

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.870 
he had been convinced the blood loss
incurred<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:38.340> enough<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> kill

incurred by this would be enough to kill
someone<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.810> apparently<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.439> had

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
someone but apparently he had

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
someone but apparently he had
underestimated<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.340> matter<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:42.479> far<00:01:42.750> as

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
underestimated the matter as far as

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
underestimated the matter as far as
beyond<00:01:43.200> birthday<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.770> concerned<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.820> actual

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
beyond birthday was concerned the actual

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.270 
beyond birthday was concerned the actual
method<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.540> murder<00:01:45.720> rated<00:01:46.530> fairly<00:01:46.890> low<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
method of murder rated fairly low on the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
method of murder rated fairly low on the
amusement<00:01:47.670> scale<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.840> never<00:01:49.020> more

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
amusement scale and I was never more

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
amusement scale and I was never more
than<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.649> interesting<00:01:50.189> experiment<00:01:50.780> but<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
than an interesting experiment but to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
than an interesting experiment but to
not<00:01:52.020> particularly<00:01:52.619> matter<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> him<00:01:53.280> whether
