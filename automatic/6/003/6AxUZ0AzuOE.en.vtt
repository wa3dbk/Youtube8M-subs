00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.270
 hello how are you all so many thanks 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.550
 for visiting my channel but today I'm going 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.470
 to show you do three little things well 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.860
 nice for this day of love and 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.860
 friendship 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.240
 to start doing this sailing center 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.880
 We're going to need a little bit of ribbon 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.870
 a base video quote like these 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.590
 pebbles 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 food coloring red color one 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.559
 little hot glue and a little trickle 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.890
 of water the first thing we're going to start 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.790
 to do is to stick our ribbon 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 you can put it down in the middle and here 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.079
 I'm going to put it down 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.250
 since we set the bar we added the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 pebble on our low 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.940
 these pebbles and the cow and the base myself 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.940
 I bought it in a dollar store 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.740
 and we put our stores will 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.080
 add a splash of water and Now 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.080
 we put our color red 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.210
 that the stones are not there 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.210
 It will sink us 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.420
 and so our base remains 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.289
 and to start doing our second 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.710
 detail we are going to need a little bag 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.500
 of these cycles with a little bit of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.179
 cheerios some tweezers of these 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.460
 You can also find them in the 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.630
 dollar store that brings like fifty 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.369
 two little eyes of these winners that are going to 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.069
 serve to make the antennas of the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.870
 butterflies first thing we're going to 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.870
 to start doing is to paste the little eyes 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.410
 and now here what we are going to do is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.410
 start making our antennas 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 and so it remains and a little heart appears and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.260
 now we leave our guys to the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.260
 half 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.069
 and so is our butterfly instead of 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.730
 put a lot of sweets to our children 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.470
 we can put a snack with cereal 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.430
 here I am using cheerios as 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.400
 I already told you and look at her how beautiful I look 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.260
 and in the third one I loved that 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.290
 It is very beautiful and very easy because 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.620
 we're going to need a tin of tuna 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.379
 for you I clarify clothespins and the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.569
 pot that you prefer to me I liked it 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.480
 is because it goes very well with the day 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.250
 of the week in the color red now since 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.590
 We're going well our kitty are going to 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.889
 start nailing our tapes all 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.889
 around 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.810
 and taking advantage of that I have extra ribbon 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.810
 I will put here around 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.980
 and so they were our little details for 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.470
