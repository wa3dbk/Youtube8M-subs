all<00:00:01.199> right<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.380> thought<00:00:01.680> I'd<00:00:01.770> show<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.070> the

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
all right I thought I'd show you the

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.340 
all right I thought I'd show you the
trucker<00:00:02.850> box<00:00:03.179> that<00:00:03.389> we've<00:00:03.540> got<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.080> for

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
trucker box that we've got going on for

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.519 
trucker box that we've got going on for
the<00:00:04.680> big<00:00:05.250> rig<00:00:05.490> applications<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:07.230> box

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
the big rig applications this box

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.970 
the big rig applications this box
actually<00:00:07.799> mounts<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.990> frame<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
actually mounts on to the frame of the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.709 
actually mounts on to the frame of the
truck<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.759> some<00:00:11.969> clamps<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.570> not

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
truck with some clamps you are not

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.070 
truck with some clamps you are not
drilling<00:00:12.990> any<00:00:13.259> holes<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.549> inside<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
drilling any holes at all inside and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
drilling any holes at all inside and
we'll<00:00:16.440> get<00:00:16.560> inside<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
we'll get inside here and look at the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.230 
we'll get inside here and look at the
inside<00:00:17.699> real<00:00:18.150> quick<00:00:22.850> okay<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
inside real quick okay I'm just going to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.710 
inside real quick okay I'm just going to
start<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.869> at<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> front<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:26.010> has<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
start right here at the front this has a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.339 
start right here at the front this has a
2.5<00:00:27.720> gallon<00:00:27.800> water<00:00:28.800> reservoir<00:00:29.720> we<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.900> have

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
2.5 gallon water reservoir we also have

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010 
2.5 gallon water reservoir we also have
the<00:00:31.619> PWM<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> p1<00:00:33.570> 50

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the PWM which is a p1 50

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
the PWM which is a p1 50
current-limiting<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.250> wherever<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.850> set<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
current-limiting so wherever you set the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.740 
current-limiting so wherever you set the
current<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> cell<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.969> stay<00:00:39.180> steady<00:00:39.510> or

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
current for the cell will stay steady or

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.709 
current for the cell will stay steady or
or<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.980> output<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.790> set<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.210> 3<00:00:42.450> liters

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
or the output if we set it at 3 liters

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
or the output if we set it at 3 liters
per<00:00:42.899> minute<00:00:43.050> it'll<00:00:43.500> always<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:44.100> 3<00:00:44.370> liters<00:00:44.640> per

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
per minute it'll always do 3 liters per

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.020 
per minute it'll always do 3 liters per
minute<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.270> don't<00:00:45.329> care<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.809> hot<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.200> cold

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
minute I don't care if it's hot or cold

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200 
minute I don't care if it's hot or cold
we<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.660> our<00:00:49.520> 200<00:00:50.520> amp<00:00:50.640> relay<00:00:50.879> that's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we also have our 200 amp relay that's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.420 
we also have our 200 amp relay that's
down<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.500> that's<00:00:52.500> also<00:00:52.829> hooked<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.309> our

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
down here that's also hooked into our

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.600 
down here that's also hooked into our
safety<00:00:53.730> module<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.840> over<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.610> we

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
safety module that's right over here we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
safety module that's right over here we
have<00:00:56.760> several<00:00:57.090> safeties<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> play<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have several safeties in play in this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.529 
have several safeties in play in this
system

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
system

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
system
iemon<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.440> call<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.859> water<00:01:02.070> level

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
iemon has a what we call a water level

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.420 
iemon has a what we call a water level
indicator<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.840> water<00:01:04.260> level<00:01:04.619> circuit

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
indicator and also a water level circuit

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850 
indicator and also a water level circuit
that's<00:01:06.030> inside<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> does<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that's inside here and what that does is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's inside here and what that does is
it<00:01:08.010> always<00:01:08.189> maintains<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.270> water<00:01:09.479> level<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it always maintains the water level and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.600 
it always maintains the water level and
keeps<00:01:10.890> keeps<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> water<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.420> too<00:01:13.200> low

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
keeps keeps the water from going too low

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.730 
keeps keeps the water from going too low
so<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.330> an<00:01:15.600> issue<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so that we don't have an issue with the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
so that we don't have an issue with the
water<00:01:19.970> going<00:01:20.970> too<00:01:21.210> low<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> cell<00:01:21.869> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
water going too low in the cell so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
water going too low in the cell so
basically<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.340> floating<00:01:23.820> device<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
basically there's a floating device in

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
basically there's a floating device in
here<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.290> always<00:01:25.470> maintain<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.100> least

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here that will always maintain at least

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
here that will always maintain at least
about<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.030> quarters<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> gallon<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
about three quarters of a gallon in the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
about three quarters of a gallon in the
system<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.009> never<00:01:29.189> an<00:01:29.369> issue<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:30.540> case

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
system so there's never an issue in case

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
system so there's never an issue in case
you<00:01:30.900> forget<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> fill<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.920> an<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.579> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you forget to fill it up an out you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
you forget to fill it up an out you know
a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.360> owner/operator<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a lot of these are owner/operator and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
a lot of these are owner/operator and
also<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.369> maintenance<00:01:35.970> crews<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> go

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
also they have maintenance crews that go

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.450 
also they have maintenance crews that go
through<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> trucks<00:01:37.650> probably<00:01:38.040> every<00:01:38.250> week

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
through the trucks probably every week

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
through the trucks probably every week
so<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.869> forget<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> add<00:01:40.470> water<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so if they forget to add water to the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
so if they forget to add water to the
cell<00:01:41.340> system<00:01:41.820> it'll<00:01:42.030> automatically<00:01:42.659> shut

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
cell system it'll automatically shut

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
cell system it'll automatically shut
down<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.710> they'll<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.340> indicator<00:01:44.759> letting

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
down and they'll be an indicator letting

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
down and they'll be an indicator letting
them<00:01:45.299> know<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.229> something's<00:01:46.740> wrong

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
them know that a it's something's wrong

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
them know that a it's something's wrong
with<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> system<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.759> need<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> check<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
with the system so they need to check it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880 
with the system so they need to check it
and<00:01:48.570> come<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> find<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.350> maybe<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and come to find out maybe it's just

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
and come to find out maybe it's just
water<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.520> pinched<00:01:51.329> hose<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> get

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
water or pinched hose we're going to get

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
water or pinched hose we're going to get
to<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.790> pressure<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.450> safety

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
to that there's a pressure a safety

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
has a safety feature for that we also

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.160 
has a safety feature for that we also
have<00:02:08.340> another<00:02:08.640> feature<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.959> right

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
have another feature that this right

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.550 
have another feature that this right
here<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> filter<00:02:10.860> system<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:12.330> right<00:02:12.540> here

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
here is a filter system this right here

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.010 
here is a filter system this right here
we'll<00:02:13.620> filter<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.670> gas<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.690> moisture

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
we'll filter out the gas and moisture

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.470 
we'll filter out the gas and moisture
out<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.410> system<00:02:16.910> before<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.030> enters<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
filter back into the tank so there's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.780 
filter back into the tank so there's

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
safety on here there's a fan on here

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.390 
safety on here there's a fan on here
that<00:02:36.390> fan<00:02:36.690> will<00:02:36.930> kick<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:38.250> the

summertime if it's extremely hot that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.530 
summertime if it's extremely hot that
will<00:02:40.709> kick<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> roughly<00:02:41.640> around<00:02:41.760> 140

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
will kick on it roughly around 140

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.009 
will kick on it roughly around 140

complete box inside this is the cell
down<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.540> three<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.290> four

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
down here this is a a three to four

down here this is a a three to four
liter<00:02:52.769> per<00:02:53.160> minute<00:02:53.280> unit<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:55.590> recommend<00:02:56.130> about

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
liter per minute unit we recommend about

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.850 
liter per minute unit we recommend about
three<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> mean<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.840> varies<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.440> engine

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
three I mean it just varies on engine

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.530 
three I mean it just varies on engine
size<00:02:59.069> as<00:02:59.489> well<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:01.110> also<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:02.209> thermal<00:03:03.209> unit

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
size as well we also have a thermal unit

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080 
size as well we also have a thermal unit
this<00:03:03.989> right<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.860> 110<00:03:05.310> application

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
this right here is the 110 application

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.050 
this right here is the 110 application
what<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.690> does<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.470> when<00:03:08.069> it's<00:03:08.519> extremely

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
what this does is when it's extremely

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.440 
what this does is when it's extremely
cold<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.989> will<00:03:10.200> kick<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.060> keep<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> box

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
cold this will kick on and keep the box

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.390 
cold this will kick on and keep the box
at<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.989> temperature<00:03:13.530> where<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.799> won't<00:03:13.920> freeze

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
at a temperature where it won't freeze

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.850 
at a temperature where it won't freeze
they<00:03:15.150> also<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.750> available<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
they also have this available in the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.280 
they also have this available in the
12-volt<00:03:17.310> system<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:18.060> well<00:03:18.299> but<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.140> can

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
12-volt system as well but we can

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.900 
12-volt system as well but we can
actually<00:03:19.410> wrap<00:03:19.769> hoses<00:03:20.280> themselves<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
actually wrap hoses themselves so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.870 
actually wrap hoses themselves so
there's<00:03:21.239> no<00:03:21.390> freezing<00:03:21.959> issue<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:23.370> also<00:03:23.549> has

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
there's no freezing issue it also has

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.009 
there's no freezing issue it also has
another<00:03:24.739> feature<00:03:25.739> on<00:03:26.070> here<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:27.329> when<00:03:27.900> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
another feature on here that when you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.830 
another feature on here that when you
hook<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> ignition<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:30.329> runs<00:03:30.630> off

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
hook this up to the ignition it runs off

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.500 
hook this up to the ignition it runs off
of<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.140> current<00:03:31.739> sensing<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.370> well<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.359> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
of a current sensing as well as the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.509 
of a current sensing as well as the
ignition<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.170> there's<00:03:34.500> two<00:03:34.739> safeties<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.220> play

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
ignition so there's two safeties in play

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.280 
ignition so there's two safeties in play
with<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.329> there's<00:03:36.660> no<00:03:36.810> accidental

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
with that so that there's no accidental

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.129 
with that so that there's no accidental
of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.579> unit<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.269> while<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.350> ignitions<00:03:40.829> on

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
of the unit on while the ignitions on

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.629 
of the unit on while the ignitions on
that's<00:03:43.139> pretty<00:03:43.410> much<00:03:43.620> sums<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.100> up<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:44.280> this

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
that's pretty much sums it up for this

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.910 
that's pretty much sums it up for this
box<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.989> thought<00:03:46.230> I'd<00:03:46.380> do<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> video<00:03:46.709> on

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
box I just thought I'd do a video on

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.500 
box I just thought I'd do a video on
this<00:03:47.250> real<00:03:47.489> quick<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.109> have<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.139> good<00:03:49.380> day
