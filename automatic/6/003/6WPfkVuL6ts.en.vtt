00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.280 

all<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.090> way<00:01:10.180> around

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.940 

and<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.680> there

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550 

this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.969> clutch<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.600> came<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.259> or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this is the clutch that came with the or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.039 
this is the clutch that came with the or
for<00:01:22.890> crank<00:01:26.149> which<00:01:27.149> has<00:01:27.390> teeth<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:27.930> way

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
for crank which has teeth all the way

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
for crank which has teeth all the way
around<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.469> you<00:01:28.649> can<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.219> slip<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.240> right

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
around so you can just slip this right

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.399 
around so you can just slip this right
on<00:01:32.179> but<00:01:33.179> when<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.600> look<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.899> this<00:01:34.140> new<00:01:34.380> crank

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
on but when you look at this new crank

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.559 
on but when you look at this new crank
because<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.829> flat<00:01:38.250> spot<00:01:38.569> the

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
because of that flat spot the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.139 
because of that flat spot the
installation<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.500> possible<00:01:41.460> only<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.909> one

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
installation is possible only in one

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.899 
installation is possible only in one
direction<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.319> one<00:01:43.590> won't<00:01:43.909> won't

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
direction so this one won't won't

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
direction so this one won't won't
install<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.719> old<00:01:45.960> one

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
install with the old one

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.620 
install with the old one
you<00:01:46.770> had<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.360> line<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.569> some<00:01:48.780> marks<00:01:49.490> there's<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
you had to line up some marks there's a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.609 
you had to line up some marks there's a
there's<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.750> spot<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
there's a spot right here and then I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.339 
there's a spot right here and then I
believe<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.929> there's<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:58.049> mark<00:02:00.349> right

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
believe there's there's a mark right

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.120 
believe there's there's a mark right
here<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.220> starter<00:02:02.610> clutch<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> new

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
here on the starter clutch so the new

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.690 
here on the starter clutch so the new
one<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.640> guessing<00:02:06.020> eliminates<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.700> problem

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
one I'm guessing eliminates this problem

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.839 
one I'm guessing eliminates this problem
and<00:02:08.880> makes<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.299> installation<00:02:09.479> foolproof

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
and makes the installation foolproof

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.370 
and makes the installation foolproof
sorry<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> noise<00:02:12.420> furnace<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.140> about

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
sorry about the noise furnace is about

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.220 
sorry about the noise furnace is about
to<00:02:13.560> kick<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.720> here's<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.079> discovered

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to kick in and here's what I discovered

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.530 
to kick in and here's what I discovered
so<00:02:17.040> far<00:02:17.069> online<00:02:20.959> when<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.989> went<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:23.540> part

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
so far online when I went to part

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.099 
so far online when I went to part
ordering<00:02:25.019> online<00:02:26.359> you<00:02:27.359> can<00:02:27.569> see<00:02:28.760> there's<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
ordering online you can see there's a

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:36.410 
ordering online you can see there's a
clutch<00:02:31.109> set<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:32.700> 2004<00:02:33.630> model<00:02:34.019> k4<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.420> then

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
clutch set for 2004 model k4 and then

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
clutch set for 2004 model k4 and then
there<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.350> clutch<00:02:38.340> starter<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.900> way<00:02:40.170> model

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
there is a clutch starter one way model

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.930 
there is a clutch starter one way model
for<00:02:42.000> k5<00:02:42.540> k-6<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.319> k7<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> rest<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.700> first

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
for k5 k-6 and k7 the rest of the first

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.979 
for k5 k-6 and k7 the rest of the first

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
generation the first generation model

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.860 
generation the first generation model
years<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.250> guessing<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.329> what<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> need

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
years so I'm guessing that's what I need

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.559 
years so I'm guessing that's what I need
to<00:02:52.019> order<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.829> obviously<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.819> pricey<00:02:54.180> I

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
to order but obviously it's pricey I

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.020 
to order but obviously it's pricey I
don't<00:02:55.380> want<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> order<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.010> wrong<00:02:56.190> thing<00:02:56.609> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
don't want to order the wrong thing and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.129 
don't want to order the wrong thing and
just<00:02:57.889> get<00:02:58.889> stuck<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.609> so<00:02:59.850> that's<00:03:00.810> my

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
just get stuck with it so that's my

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.030 
just get stuck with it so that's my
situation

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
situation

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.069 
situation
and<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.159> hope<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.519> video<00:03:04.760> helps<00:03:05.299> others<00:03:05.810> who
