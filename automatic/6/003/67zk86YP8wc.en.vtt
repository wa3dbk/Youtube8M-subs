00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
reader and one more thing the reason I'm

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
reader and one more thing the reason I'm
using<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.379> app<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.309> I've<00:01:05.519> tried

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
using this app is because I've tried

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.560 
using this app is because I've tried
about<00:01:05.970> ten<00:01:06.420> apps<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:08.310> supposed<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.030> do

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
about ten apps that are supposed to do

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.719 
about ten apps that are supposed to do
this<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> only<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> far

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this but this is the only one so far

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
this but this is the only one so far
that<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> found<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.320> makes<00:01:13.560> my

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that I found that actually makes my

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
that I found that actually makes my
internet<00:01:14.640> connection<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> Wi-Fi

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
internet connection as a Wi-Fi

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
internet connection as a Wi-Fi
connection<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:17.759> devices<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.720> laptop

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
connection for my devices or my laptop

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
connection for my devices or my laptop
so<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> reason<00:01:20.700> why<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.270> using<00:01:21.299> this

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
which is kind of um is is kind of a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.729 
which is kind of um is is kind of a
glitch<00:03:51.299> because<00:03:52.299> um<00:03:52.569> I<00:03:52.780> had<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.440> thing

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
glitch because um I had this one thing

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.309 
glitch because um I had this one thing
before<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.430> would<00:03:55.030> appear<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.810> my<00:03:55.930> status<00:03:56.290> bar

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
before it would appear in my status bar

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.309 
before it would appear in my status bar
of<00:03:56.709> how<00:03:57.370> many<00:03:57.609> megabytes<00:03:58.450> uploading<00:03:59.170> and

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
of how many megabytes uploading and

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.470 
of how many megabytes uploading and
downloading<00:03:59.379> I<00:03:59.950> had<00:04:00.129> so<00:04:00.730> I<00:04:00.760> think<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.239> just

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
downloading I had so I think it's just

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.319 
downloading I had so I think it's just
with<00:04:01.750> this<00:04:01.870> app<00:04:02.170> but<00:04:02.920> um<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.549> numbers<00:04:03.909> were<00:04:04.090> a

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
with this app but um the numbers were a

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.349 
with this app but um the numbers were a
lot<00:04:04.659> larger<00:04:05.470> than<00:04:05.889> they<00:04:06.280> are<00:04:06.310> right<00:04:06.909> now<00:04:06.970> at

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
lot larger than they are right now at

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.580 
lot larger than they are right now at
one<00:04:07.900> point<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.470> eight<00:04:09.629> so<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:10.989> think<00:04:11.139> that's<00:04:11.470> a

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
one point one eight so I think that's a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.890 
one point one eight so I think that's a
glitch<00:04:11.799> I<00:04:12.129> know<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.030> internet<00:04:13.329> connection<00:04:13.599> is

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
glitch I know the internet connection is

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.569 
glitch I know the internet connection is
way<00:04:14.079> faster<00:04:14.290> than<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.799> just<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.340> show<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
way faster than that just to show you

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.479 
way faster than that just to show you

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
because all the other apps were either

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.510 
because all the other apps were either
fakes<00:05:11.600> or<00:05:12.169> they<00:05:12.560> just<00:05:12.590> didn't<00:05:13.010> do<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.340> same

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
fakes or they just didn't do the same

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.190 
fakes or they just didn't do the same
features<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.120> this<00:05:14.330> one<00:05:14.510> does<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.080> I'm

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
features that this one does and I'm

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.560 
features that this one does and I'm
pretty<00:05:15.500> sure<00:05:15.680> this<00:05:15.890> will<00:05:16.040> work<00:05:16.100> on<00:05:16.820> Sprint

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570
