00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello again friends well then today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's pick up two pepper plants 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.350
 of standard that we have left from the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.350
 beginning of season we cut through here 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.160
 as you see 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.090
 the plants are very healthy they have not 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.070
 had diseases or pests 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.329
 and the foundations but good already they begin to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.579
 wrinkle 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.309
 they are already very red and very mature and it is 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.370
 time to remove them to remove the 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.039
 seeds we are already to September 23 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.049
 just entered the autumn and well no 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.799
 I want them to get wet let's see how they 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.799
 we take out the seeds 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.489
 Well, we have already put it in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 gone home and we are going to remove them from the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.299
 Bush 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 to the exquisite state this year the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.000
 PadrÃ³n peppers I like 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.390
 very much I have had up to 30 you kill this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 year 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.940
 taking out the seeds we improve the fruit 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.400
 we are adapting it to our land and 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.080
 our garden 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.320
 Y 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.190
 we will improve the species so I will 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.040
 I recommend 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 and so have seeds for the year 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.680
 following 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.680
 we save money 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.399
 and at least they do not deceive us with what 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.520
 they sell inside the envelopes that many 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.350
 Sometimes they say this thing and then 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.250
 it turns out that it is another 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.250
 it has happened to me 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.330
 Well let's see how we get the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 seeds 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.120
 let's take this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.210
 and this same 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 as you can see they have a size 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.970
 considerable have grown more than the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.230
 account because they had been from the first 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.860
 day of the kill 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.140
 alike have been three months since the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 beginning until until they have 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.480
 Matured in the plant 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.150
 with this blade we are going to cut the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.580
 crown as I did in another video too 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.050
 peppers 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.050
 is for the seeds to come out 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.360
 attached to the heart of the pepper 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.909
 It is very easy to do it 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.989
 of the seeds 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.989
 They do not stay 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.870
 the crown 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.239
 if there is any left then we remove them 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.239
 because you have to take advantage of them 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.110
 now with the blade 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.350
 we are describing them easy to come out 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 all right 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.270
 for all varieties of peppers 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.270
 it's the same system 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.980
 and then we will dry them 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.480
 I always say 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.430
 you put them in the shade I do not like 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.650
 that is straight because we have so much 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.060
 time for them to dry do not lift 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.060
 from the direct sun 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.210
 the shade is drying up a lot 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.960
 best 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.960
 for my taste 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
 it has always been said that for likes 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.390
 there are the colors 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.390
 this is 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.489
 these remains that remain if you do not go to 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.349
 take advantage at home of chickens and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.939
 Californian worms I like a lot 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.939
 if you have clear 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.380
 here we have already finished the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 process 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.690
 and now we are going to put as I said 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.510
 to dry six or seven days or five more 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.190
 those that are needed we are not in a hurry in 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.030
 a piece of paper 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.030
 drying 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.910
 six or seven days have passed and here 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.740
 we have the seeds of the pepper 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:55.360
 so they are already dry 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.680
 As you can see they are loose 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.009
 no longer stick 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.940
 and they are ready to be stored in the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.180
 little bags we take a bag we are going to put 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.180
 name 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.750
 a red pepper 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.949
 September 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.510
 of 2014 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.500
 well we know when we have touched them 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.980
 we take 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.560
 and the bag 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.910
 we close the doctor 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.600
 and here we have them already 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.890
 ready to save in the box 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.890
 where I have the rest 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.130
 to your corresponding site 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.260
 to the area of the peppers 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.310
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.710
