bit<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> compression<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.590> enough<00:00:21.740> see<00:00:22.740> if

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
bit of compression but not enough see if

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.390 
bit of compression but not enough see if
I<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> push<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> down<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:25.130> but<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.279> easy

I can push this down up but it's easy

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830 
I can push this down up but it's easy
enough<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> push<00:00:26.970> down<00:00:27.090> freely<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
enough for me to push down freely see I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.560 
enough for me to push down freely see I
can<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.800> thing<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> sometimes<00:00:30.119> it

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
can just it thing is sometimes it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.609 
can just it thing is sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:30.750> even<00:00:30.869> grab<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.349> should<00:00:31.500> push

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
doesn't even grab like you should push

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
doesn't even grab like you should push
down<00:00:31.800> hard<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.489> doesn't<00:00:32.579> grab<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.180> like

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
down hard it doesn't grab so it's like

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.610 
down hard it doesn't grab so it's like
right<00:00:34.350> there

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
right there

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:50.540 
right there
I<00:00:48.020> guess<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.200> already<00:00:49.350> been<00:00:49.559> drained<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.370> all

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I guess it's already been drained of all

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
I guess it's already been drained of all
of<00:00:50.730> its<00:00:52.610> feet<00:00:53.610> um<00:00:54.110> missions<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.410> gasps

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of its feet um missions over there gasps

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
of its feet um missions over there gasps
and<00:00:56.370> antifreeze<00:00:56.820> well<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.750> still<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.140> oil

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and antifreeze well this still has oil

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.920 
and antifreeze well this still has oil
and<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.980> see

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.340 

so<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:08.290> clutch<00:01:09.290> still<00:01:09.920> has<00:01:10.070> oil<00:01:11.350> whatever

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
so this clutch still has oil whatever

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.890 
so this clutch still has oil whatever
