00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
like a Steve that snagged and the float

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.990 
like a Steve that snagged and the float
broke<00:01:04.850> off<00:01:05.979> he's<00:01:06.979> still<00:01:07.250> moving<00:01:07.430> going

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
broke off he's still moving going

through the rapids can you see it out

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:41.649 
through the rapids can you see it out
there<00:01:24.909> it's<00:01:25.909> still<00:01:26.210> on<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.509> move<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:41.390> shoot

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.789 

moving<00:01:48.899> slowly<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.869> uncle<00:01:52.170> Steve<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
moving slowly now uncle Steve had the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.779 
moving slowly now uncle Steve had the
thought<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> he<00:01:53.549> could<00:01:53.759> enter<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.270> river<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
thought that he could enter the river a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:19.970 
thought that he could enter the river a
bit<00:01:56.789> farther<00:01:57.090> down<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> intercepted

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.080 

and<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.640> moving<00:02:20.879> pretty<00:02:21.060> slowly<00:02:21.599> now<00:02:23.090> may

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and that's moving pretty slowly now may

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:34.670 
and that's moving pretty slowly now may
not<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.360> worth<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.720> wait<00:02:33.260> maybe<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.410> can

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
not be worth the wait maybe we can

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:54.350 
not be worth the wait maybe we can
intercept<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.519> here<00:02:52.819> there's<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.910> board

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
intercept it up here there's a board

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.520 
intercept it up here there's a board
down<00:02:54.660> below<00:02:56.540> because<00:02:57.540> Steve<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.930> uncertain
