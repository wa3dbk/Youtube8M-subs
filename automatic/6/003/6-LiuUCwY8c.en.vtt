00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 this is actually my favorite where i am 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 Really, even if they are a bit 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.099
 expensive it costs a tax bonus from herbert 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.830
 the sword treasures are still thought 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.780
 sharper than the other two of haller 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.199
 is that the blade met so with de 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.359
 could have happened with that can 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.859
 Fillet the hair number is really good 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 also has a thick thick oil in the back 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.720
 just the nasty thing about a cord or something 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 There are other things to do there 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.579
 optics here is beautiful in this through 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 An area has a security 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 locking something with open area 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.140
 here has a security relocation here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 that 's a bit stiff so you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 needs nonsense fingernails around her 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 close 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.489
 then she actually keeps it right 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.399
 and then you have to open again 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.370
 press her too tight so it is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.199
 okay if he needs it , that's okay 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 I also like something else 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.160
 no screws are used but 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 has this longer in the bus that brings that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 all things a bit 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 high quality and now times said 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.320
 used to realize fingernail 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.310
 to push at the back 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 otherwise i can show better so so 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.770
 is he just has quickly marred 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.619
 all again you can see now 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 Sounds nice and soft 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 stainless and stainless cool so for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 me and is also very beautiful of the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 Hartz IV receiver weight distribution Yes 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 very nice hand in it I am mine 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.220
 favorit and mamas 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.220
 there are, however, with ten euro drops 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 Either this cheap 10 allerding 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.880
 or that of hawass has appealing 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:02:01.640
 bigger people 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:04.579
 cool but close up on what now 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.960
 As far as durability is concerned, I can do that 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.509
 do not say anything because there seems no 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.429
 I just have to be professional had 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.860
 otherwise this victorinox knife but 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.620
 honestly, nothing is of anything 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 nothing half nothing is true though 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.610
 high quality but is his 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.840
 a lot or too little so 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.640
 simply normal pocketknife is normal 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:34.849
 pocketknives except for a bit of that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:38.209
 here the best victorinox knife that where 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.519
 there is the mini to the team is he 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.780
 one under brutally sharp blade would be 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.519
 in it nail file third in it and that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.360
 in the past we were still looking at the numbers 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:59.200
 made of wood plastic the other theme good 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 only one of you a whole and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 I stop the study 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.340
 visually and from the processing ago I 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.560
 Well 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.350
 even from the one in the hospital over here 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.650
 I feel very well in it 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.450
 the back here niebel no flitzer 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.069
 Cross screws are in there 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.889
 bus also does a bit 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.280
 I think it's more important to eat what I eat 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.579
 People 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.579
 That's it
