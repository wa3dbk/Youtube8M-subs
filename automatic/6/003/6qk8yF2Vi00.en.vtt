00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a it's a seed apparently that that if

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.039 
a it's a seed apparently that that if
you<00:00:13.080> go<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.790> cave<00:00:15.120> you

get killed by Hera Brian himself so I'm

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.330 
get killed by Hera Brian himself so I'm
gonna<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:22.519> try<00:00:23.519> out<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> seed<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
gonna just try out the seed so this is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.340 
gonna just try out the seed so this is
the<00:00:26.430> seed<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:26.849> here

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.520

Hera Brian 131 just like this that's the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.670 
Hera Brian 131 just like this that's the
seed<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> apparently<00:01:03.570> there's<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> cave<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
seed so apparently there's a cave in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
seed so apparently there's a cave in
your<00:01:04.800> spawn<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.520> you<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.210> get

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
your spawn and if you go in you get

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.250 
your spawn and if you go in you get
killed<00:01:06.690> like<00:01:07.850> instantaneously<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
air just starts attacking you so now

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.730 
air just starts attacking you so now
it's<00:01:17.460> loaded

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.919 

if<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.859> have<00:01:24.039> any<00:01:24.219> other<00:01:24.310> ideas<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.509> what

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
might bring hair Brian like right in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.499 
might bring hair Brian like right in
front<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.210> your<00:01:28.299> face<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.880> summoning

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
them just to leave a leave your idea in

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:44.200 
them just to leave a leave your idea in
the<00:01:34.210> comments<00:01:34.630> section<00:01:34.659> they'll<00:01:35.020> test<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.319> out

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.830 

never<00:01:44.840> takes<00:01:45.200> this<00:01:45.320> long<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.799> load<00:01:47.200> come<00:01:48.200> on

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
never takes this long to load come on

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:00.300 
never takes this long to load come on
there<00:01:50.840> we<00:01:50.930> go<00:01:51.049> almost<00:01:51.860> done<00:01:53.140> okay

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.000 

so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
so

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.890 
so
it<00:02:02.490> doesn't<00:02:02.820> seem<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> cave<00:02:03.510> nearby<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
it doesn't seem to be a cave nearby a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:15.870 
it doesn't seem to be a cave nearby a
lot<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.020> pigs<00:02:09.290> but<00:02:10.290> no<00:02:10.619> cave

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.690 

no<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.080> little<00:02:17.320> little<00:02:18.040> ditch

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.670 

dishes<00:02:26.540> ditches<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.170> mortgages

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.030 

what<00:02:34.489> was<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
what was that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.589 
what was that
I<00:02:36.129> thought<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:36.879> saw<00:02:36.969> a<00:02:37.180> bunch<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.900> gray<00:02:38.230> dogs

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
I thought I saw a bunch of gray dogs

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.699 
I thought I saw a bunch of gray dogs
meaning<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:41.049> was<00:02:41.140> something<00:02:41.349> built

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
meaning that there was something built

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.800 
meaning that there was something built
here<00:02:41.920> probably<00:02:42.489> like<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:42.879> whole<00:02:43.209> bunch<00:02:43.629> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
here probably like a whole bunch of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:54.870 
here probably like a whole bunch of
cobblestone

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.340 

doesn't<00:02:55.630> seem<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.870> be<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.020> cave<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:56.680> miles<00:02:58.350> well

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
doesn't seem to be a cave for miles well

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.200 
doesn't seem to be a cave for miles well
that's<00:02:59.530> because<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.310> checked<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.030> that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
that's because I just checked out that

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.920 
that's because I just checked out that
area<00:03:01.570> now<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.790> want<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> cave<00:03:04.240> by<00:03:04.450> spawn<00:03:04.750> I'm

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
area now do you want a cave by spawn I'm

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.340 
area now do you want a cave by spawn I'm
going<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:06.120> idea<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.210> what<00:03:07.630> by<00:03:07.930> spawn

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
going with the idea of what by spawn

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.240 
going with the idea of what by spawn
would<00:03:08.650> mean<00:03:08.890> probably<00:03:09.580> like<00:03:09.760> under<00:03:10.890> under<00:03:11.890> 50

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
would mean probably like under under 50

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.360 
would mean probably like under under 50
blocks<00:03:12.490> away<00:03:12.850> from<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.120> spawn

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.150 

and<00:03:19.940> ditches

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.700 

hold<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> fuck<00:03:29.520> still

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.980 

hold<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.820> fuck<00:03:35.270> still

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.500 

then

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.290 

who<00:03:42.080> is<00:03:42.140> this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:59.180 

this<00:03:48.930> looks<00:03:49.800> promising<00:03:50.990> looked

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:16.660 

nothing

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.960 

that's<00:04:17.300> weird

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
that's weird

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:28.430 
that's weird
I<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.570> floating<00:04:20.470> sound<00:04:20.940> pretty<00:04:21.940> weird

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.200
