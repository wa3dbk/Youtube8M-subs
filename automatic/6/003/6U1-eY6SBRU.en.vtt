00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
although be aware that some colors are

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.250 
although be aware that some colors are
more<00:00:34.770> expensive<00:00:35.070> than<00:00:35.370> others<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.170> just<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
more expensive than others and just a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
more expensive than others and just a
little<00:00:37.469> FYI<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> whole

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
little FYI it's not actually the whole

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
little FYI it's not actually the whole
case<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> changes<00:00:39.629> color<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> series

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
case that changes color with this series

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
case that changes color with this series
it's<00:00:40.950> only<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.850> bump<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.270> out<00:00:42.450> out

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's only this kind of bump out out out

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.229 
it's only this kind of bump out out out
skirt<00:00:43.410> part<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.640> see<00:00:44.760> mine<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
skirt part you can see mine is a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
skirt part you can see mine is a
gunmetal<00:00:45.600> color<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> red<00:00:46.620> one

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
gunmetal color so if you get the red one

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.020 
gunmetal color so if you get the red one
it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> whole<00:00:47.370> thing's<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it's not like the whole thing's going to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's not like the whole thing's going to
be<00:00:48.120> read<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.450> only<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> outside

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be read it's only this kind of outside

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
be read it's only this kind of outside
edge<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:52.289> color

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
edge it's going to be a different color

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
edge it's going to be a different color
so<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:52.980> aware<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.760> yeah<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so just be aware of that and yeah the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
so just be aware of that and yeah the
case<00:00:54.989> itself<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.680> honestly<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
case itself here honestly I think it's a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
case itself here honestly I think it's a
very<00:00:57.120> nice<00:00:57.300> case<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> most

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
very nice case it's not the most

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
very nice case it's not the most
expensive<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.160> not<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> cheapest

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
expensive but it's not the cheapest

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
expensive but it's not the cheapest
either<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.750> say<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.260> feels

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
either and I would say that it feels

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
either and I would say that it feels
more<00:01:01.859> expensive<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.449> now

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
more expensive than it actually is now

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
more expensive than it actually is now
the<00:01:04.470> back<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> soft<00:01:05.850> touch<00:01:06.090> plastic

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the back is a kind of soft touch plastic

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
the back is a kind of soft touch plastic
I<00:01:06.869> wouldn't<00:01:07.380> say<00:01:07.439> grippy<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.400> but<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.939> not

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I wouldn't say grippy at all but I'm not

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
I wouldn't say grippy at all but I'm not
sure<00:01:09.570> exactly<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.380> grippy<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> Nexus<00:01:11.310> 6<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

that<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.439> means<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.640> parts

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that actually means is it's in two parts

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
that actually means is it's in two parts
if<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.540> pull<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> apart<00:01:24.990> you'll<00:01:25.290> see

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
if I just pull this apart you'll see

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.370 
if I just pull this apart you'll see
exactly<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.009> mean<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.810> left<00:01:27.990> hand<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
exactly what I mean in my left hand is a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.260 
exactly what I mean in my left hand is a
kind<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> bumper<00:01:29.159> outside<00:01:29.610> edge<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
kind of bumper outside edge bit and in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
kind of bumper outside edge bit and in
the<00:01:30.540> middle<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the middle is a kind of you know the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
the middle is a kind of you know the
actual<00:01:32.280> case<00:01:32.670> part<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.079> means

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
actual case part so that's what it means

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
actual case part so that's what it means
by<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> hybrid<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:36.000> should<00:01:36.210> give

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
by kind of hybrid and that should give

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
by kind of hybrid and that should give
you<00:01:36.540> quite<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> lot<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.110> protection<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:38.040> course

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you quite a lot of protection of course

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
you quite a lot of protection of course
I<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> device<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.689> yet

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I don't have the device in here just yet

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
I don't have the device in here just yet
so<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.530> sure<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.490> feels<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.299> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so I'm not sure how it feels but I can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
so I'm not sure how it feels but I can
tell<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.140> light<00:01:43.380> case<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.950> not

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tell you it's a very light case it's not

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
tell you it's a very light case it's not
going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> add<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> weight<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> case

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
going to add a lot of weight to the case

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.510 
going to add a lot of weight to the case
and<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.470> doesn't<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.220> it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and it doesn't really look like it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.859 
and it doesn't really look like it's
going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.729> add<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> lot<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> bulk<00:01:48.390> either<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
going to add a lot of bulk either it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.179 
going to add a lot of bulk either it
looks<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.619> quite<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> snug

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
looks like it's going to be quite a snug

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
looks like it's going to be quite a snug
fit<00:01:50.220> quite<00:01:50.729> tight<00:01:51.060> fitting<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.840> actually

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
fit quite tight fitting which I actually

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.749 
fit quite tight fitting which I actually
like<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> take<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.310> away

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
like so it's not going to take much away

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
like so it's not going to take much away
from<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> actual<00:01:54.180> shape<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.810> weight<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
from the actual shape or weight of the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
from the actual shape or weight of the
device<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> good<00:01:56.670> thing<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:58.200> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
device which is a good thing now in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.539 
device which is a good thing now in
terms<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> buttons<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.340> hand

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
terms of the buttons on the right hand

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.450 
terms of the buttons on the right hand
side<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.799> call<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
side here they I think they call them a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
side here they I think they call them a
metallized<00:02:03.090> polycarbonate<00:02:04.049> which<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
metallized polycarbonate which is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.319 
metallized polycarbonate which is
probably<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.649> posh<00:02:04.920> way<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.280> saying<00:02:05.579> plastic

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
probably a posh way of saying plastic

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
probably a posh way of saying plastic
with<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:07.229> bit<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> metal<00:02:07.649> inside<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
with a little bit of metal inside the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.660 
with a little bit of metal inside the
more<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:09.030> probably<00:02:09.660> coated<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.170> metal

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
more on them probably coated in metal

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.979 
more on them probably coated in metal
but<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.970> know<00:02:12.090> quite<00:02:12.270> honestly<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.629> don't<00:02:12.810> know

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
but you know quite honestly I don't know

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.430 
but you know quite honestly I don't know
how<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
how the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.990 
how the
still<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> can't<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.130> push<00:02:14.460> them<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:14.820> feel

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
still I can't really push them they feel

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.390 
still I can't really push them they feel
fine<00:02:15.410> interestingly<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
fine interestingly you can see the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.980 
fine interestingly you can see the
volume<00:02:17.790> rocker<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.180> actually<00:02:18.450> two<00:02:18.630> buttons

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
volume rocker is actually two buttons

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.630 
volume rocker is actually two buttons
here<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.260> believe<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.860> mix<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.250> six<00:02:20.460> it's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
here I believe on the mix of six it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.310 
here I believe on the mix of six it's
just<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.120> long<00:02:21.390> button<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:21.990> I'm<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:22.170> quite

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
just one long button so I'm not quite

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.170 
just one long button so I'm not quite
sure<00:02:22.410> why<00:02:22.860> they<00:02:23.070> did<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.280> why<00:02:23.820> didn't<00:02:24.090> they

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
sure why they did that why didn't they

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
sure why they did that why didn't they
didn't<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.750> make<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.930> one<00:02:25.230> bun<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.680> I'm<00:02:25.770> not

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
didn't just make it one bun so I'm not

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.400 
didn't just make it one bun so I'm not
sure<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.250> going<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.520> change<00:02:27.200> how<00:02:28.200> it's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
sure if that's going to change how it's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.110 
sure if that's going to change how it's
used<00:02:28.830> or<00:02:29.160> if<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.580> cause<00:02:29.880> any

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
used or if it's going to cause any

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.250 
used or if it's going to cause any
conflicts<00:02:30.630> we'll<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.990> wait<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.140> see

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
conflicts we'll have to wait and see

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.100 
conflicts we'll have to wait and see
until<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.680> actually<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.310> device<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.480> yeah

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
until I actually get the device but yeah

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
until I actually get the device but yeah
it's<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:34.980> nice<00:02:35.160> case<00:02:35.460> i<00:02:35.490> would

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
it's a really really nice case i would

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.040 
it's a really really nice case i would
recommend<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.450> course<00:02:36.600> i<00:02:36.690> can't<00:02:36.900> recommend

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
recommend of course i can't recommend

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.570 
recommend of course i can't recommend
one<00:02:37.380> hundred<00:02:37.590> percent<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:38.100> yet<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.400> i

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
one hundred percent just yet because i

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.040 
one hundred percent just yet because i
don't<00:02:38.970> know<00:02:39.090> what<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.360> device<00:02:39.570> feels<00:02:39.870> like

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
don't know what the device feels like

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.680 
don't know what the device feels like
inside<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.610> from<00:02:41.820> playing<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.570> it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
inside it but just from playing with it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.350 
inside it but just from playing with it
it<00:02:42.840> feels<00:02:43.080> very<00:02:43.350> very<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.850> feels<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> very

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it feels very very it feels like a very

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.660 
it feels very very it feels like a very
nice<00:02:45.630> case<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.140> feels<00:02:46.380> well<00:02:46.620> built<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.100> it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
nice case it feels well built and it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.890 
nice case it feels well built and it
feels<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.240> specifically<00:02:48.780> designed

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
feels like it's specifically designed

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.510 
feels like it's specifically designed
for<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> Nexus<00:02:49.740> 6<00:02:49.920> which<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.130> always<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.370> good

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
for the Nexus 6 which is always a good

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.890 
for the Nexus 6 which is always a good
thing<00:02:50.580> because<00:02:50.850> some<00:02:51.090> cases<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.720> feel

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
thing because some cases kind of feel

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.930 
thing because some cases kind of feel
like<00:02:51.930> they're<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.100> used<00:02:53.730> for

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
like they're just you know used for

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.250 
like they're just you know used for
something<00:02:54.120> else<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.600> they're<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.020> kind<00:02:55.200> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
something else and they're just kind of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.080 
something else and they're just kind of
an<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.710> one<00:02:55.740> situation<00:02:56.040> which<00:02:56.490> isn't<00:02:56.790> what

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
an all in one situation which isn't what

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.090 
an all in one situation which isn't what
this<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:57.900> very<00:02:58.110> good<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.590> yeah<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
this is so it's very good and yeah this

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.620 
this is so it's very good and yeah this
is<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.370> first<00:02:59.640> time<00:02:59.910> I've<00:03:00.120> got<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> real

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
is the first time I've got a real

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
is the first time I've got a real
impression<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.350> how<00:03:01.530> big<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:01.860> device

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
impression of just how big this device

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
impression of just how big this device
is<00:03:02.460> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.730> be<00:03:02.820> can<00:03:03.060> see<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.600> how<00:03:03.690> I

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
is going to be can see this is how I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.390 
is going to be can see this is how I
hold<00:03:04.080> them<00:03:04.260> how<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> hold<00:03:04.830> my<00:03:04.980> device<00:03:05.220> is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
hold them how I hold my device is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.550 
hold them how I hold my device is
normally<00:03:05.760> my<00:03:06.300> thumb<00:03:06.570> cannot<00:03:06.960> reach<00:03:07.170> all<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
normally my thumb cannot reach all the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
normally my thumb cannot reach all the
way<00:03:07.590> across<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.460> reach<00:03:08.670> about<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.940> half<00:03:09.180> way

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
way across and I reach about a half way

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.630 
way across and I reach about a half way
up<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.960> there's<00:03:10.140> no<00:03:10.320> way<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.740> one<00:03:11.100> hand<00:03:11.370> use

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
up so there's no way I can one hand use

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060 
up so there's no way I can one hand use
this<00:03:11.880> fully<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.420> can't<00:03:12.810> reach<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.650> status<00:03:14.040> bar

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
this fully I can't reach the status bar

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.040 
this fully I can't reach the status bar
without<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.550> big<00:03:15.030> big<00:03:15.300> shuffle<00:03:15.750> which<00:03:15.900> is

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
without a big big shuffle which is

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.199 
without a big big shuffle which is
probably<00:03:16.290> more<00:03:16.560> likely<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.040> drop<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.910> can't

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
probably more likely to drop and I can't

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.850 
probably more likely to drop and I can't
reach<00:03:18.720> all<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.110> way<00:03:19.140> across<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.530> device

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
reach all the way across the device

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.220 
reach all the way across the device
either<00:03:20.130> without<00:03:20.459> again<00:03:20.820> quite<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.239> big<00:03:21.630> shuffle

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
either without again quite a big shuffle

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.890 
either without again quite a big shuffle
so<00:03:22.830> if<00:03:23.100> i<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.610> bring<00:03:23.670> my<00:03:23.940> nexus<00:03:24.300> 5<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.690> here

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
so if i just bring my nexus 5 out here

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.870 
so if i just bring my nexus 5 out here
you'll<00:03:25.050> see<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.470> size<00:03:25.680> difference<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.489> Nexus

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
you'll see the size difference the Nexus

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.479 
you'll see the size difference the Nexus
5<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.090> absolutely<00:03:27.870> dwarfed<00:03:28.350> by<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.770> nexus<00:03:29.250> 6

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
5 is absolutely dwarfed by the nexus 6

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.240 
5 is absolutely dwarfed by the nexus 6
case<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.940> actually<00:03:29.970> fits<00:03:30.600> all<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.800> way<00:03:31.920> inside

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
case it actually fits all the way inside

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.070 
case it actually fits all the way inside
it<00:03:32.459> comfortably<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.239> can<00:03:33.390> see<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.780> they're

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
it comfortably you can see that they're

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.920 
it comfortably you can see that they're
just<00:03:34.320> how<00:03:34.500> how<00:03:35.160> much<00:03:35.340> more<00:03:35.730> space<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:36.870> is

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
just how how much more space there is

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.070 
just how how much more space there is
there<00:03:37.850> if<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.940> pick<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.209> my<00:03:39.300> Nexus<00:03:39.600> 5<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.780> use

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
there if I pick up my Nexus 5 and use

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.360 
there if I pick up my Nexus 5 and use
this<00:03:40.200> how<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> normally<00:03:40.620> would<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.190> see

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
this how I normally would you can see

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.670 
this how I normally would you can see
here<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.269> how<00:03:42.510> again<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> was<00:03:43.230> holding<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
here this is how again I was holding the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.470 
here this is how again I was holding the
nexus<00:03:44.070> 6<00:03:44.280> case<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.880> easily<00:03:45.269> reach

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
nexus 6 case but I can easily reach

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.300 
nexus 6 case but I can easily reach
across<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:45.840> my<00:03:46.140> thumb<00:03:46.410> again<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.830> haven't<00:03:47.100> got

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
across with my thumb again I haven't got

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.310 
across with my thumb again I haven't got
the<00:03:47.430> biggest<00:03:47.610> hands<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.630> reach<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> status

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
the biggest hands I can reach the status

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.960 
the biggest hands I can reach the status
bar<00:03:49.350> comfortably<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:50.310> can't<00:03:50.550> reach<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> top

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
bar comfortably I can't reach the top

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.370 
bar comfortably I can't reach the top
left-hand<00:03:51.239> corner<00:03:51.390> without<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.810> big<00:03:51.989> shuffle

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
left-hand corner without a big shuffle

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.949 
left-hand corner without a big shuffle
but<00:03:52.500> that's<00:03:52.620> not<00:03:52.739> really<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.010> big<00:03:53.190> issue<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.519> me

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
but that's not really a big issue for me

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.660 
but that's not really a big issue for me
so<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.290> didn't<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.860> an<00:03:55.950> issue<00:03:56.040> with<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> nexus

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
so I didn't have an issue with the nexus

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.000 
so I didn't have an issue with the nexus
5<00:03:56.850> size<00:03:57.150> now<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:57.989> can<00:03:58.290> just<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.560> holding<00:03:58.920> it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
5 size now you can just see holding it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.880 
5 size now you can just see holding it
in<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> exact<00:03:59.640> same<00:03:59.910> way<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.390> Nexus<00:04:00.720> 6<00:04:00.959> yeah

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
in the exact same way the Nexus 6 yeah

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.830 
in the exact same way the Nexus 6 yeah
it's<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.700> hell<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.150> lot<00:04:03.330> bigger<00:04:03.510> as

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it's it's a hell of a lot bigger as

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840 
it's it's a hell of a lot bigger as
expected<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.340> honest<00:04:05.580> when<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.760> first

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
expected and to be honest when I first

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.729 
expected and to be honest when I first
took<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.390> case<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.080> was<00:04:07.380> quite<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> shock

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
took the case out it was quite a shock
