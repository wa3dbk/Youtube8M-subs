00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
four five grocery bags which is good

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.780 
four five grocery bags which is good
enough<00:01:07.300> for<00:01:07.480> me<00:01:07.630> right<00:01:07.810> here<00:01:08.800> you've<00:01:09.010> got<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
enough for me right here you've got the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.460 
enough for me right here you've got the
beats<00:01:10.090> subwoofer<00:01:10.690> which<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.110> part<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
beats subwoofer which is part of the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.350 
beats subwoofer which is part of the
beats<00:01:11.680> speaker<00:01:12.280> system<00:01:12.730> I<00:01:12.910> think<00:01:13.270> it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
beats speaker system I think it's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.540 
beats speaker system I think it's
sixteen<00:01:13.720> hundred<00:01:14.020> extra<00:01:14.260> dollars<00:01:14.370> price<00:01:15.370> you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
sixteen hundred extra dollars price you

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.010 
sixteen hundred extra dollars price you
but<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.790> probably<00:01:16.090> sounds<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.420> lot<00:01:16.570> better<00:01:16.810> than

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
but it probably sounds a lot better than

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.100 
but it probably sounds a lot better than
the<00:01:17.340> standard<00:01:18.340> speaker<00:01:19.000> system<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the standard speaker system the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.810 
the standard speaker system the
sporty-er<00:01:20.620> wheels<00:01:20.830> there's<00:01:21.250> sixteen<00:01:21.640> inch

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
sporty-er wheels there's sixteen inch

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.550 
sporty-er wheels there's sixteen inch
wheels<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:22.360> they<00:01:22.480> look<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:22.810> lot<00:01:22.930> smaller<00:01:23.380> than

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
wheels so they look a lot smaller than

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.470 
wheels so they look a lot smaller than
they<00:01:23.710> are<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.100> guess<00:01:24.490> they're<00:01:24.850> six<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> half

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
they are I guess they're six and a half

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.040 
they are I guess they're six and a half
inches<00:01:26.020> wide<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.820> they're<00:01:27.940> pretty<00:01:28.030> small<00:01:28.330> but

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
inches wide so they're pretty small but

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.710 
inches wide so they're pretty small but
it's<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.260> damn<00:01:29.410> small<00:01:29.680> car<00:01:29.980> so<00:01:30.330> rightfully<00:01:31.330> so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
it's a damn small car so rightfully so

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.160 
it's a damn small car so rightfully so
you've<00:01:32.409> got<00:01:32.620> red<00:01:32.830> brake<00:01:33.070> callipers<00:01:33.990> which<00:01:34.990> is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
you've got red brake callipers which is

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.810 
you've got red brake callipers which is
always<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.500> nice<00:01:35.770> accident<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.430> isn't<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.790> say

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
always a nice accident that isn't to say

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.220 
always a nice accident that isn't to say
that<00:01:37.030> they're<00:01:37.360> necessarily<00:01:37.870> any<00:01:38.080> more

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
that they're necessarily any more

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.590 
that they're necessarily any more
powerful<00:01:38.590> than<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.130> regular<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:40.240> had<00:01:40.390> if<00:01:40.480> I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
powerful than the regular you had if I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.890 
powerful than the regular you had if I
put<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> brace<00:01:41.080> but<00:01:41.580> fairly<00:01:42.580> good<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.390> nice<00:01:43.540> it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
put a brace but fairly good so nice it's

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.630 
put a brace but fairly good so nice it's
a<00:01:43.960> nice<00:01:44.050> accent<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.650> red<00:01:44.950> circle<00:01:45.580> around

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
a nice accent to the red circle around

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
a nice accent to the red circle around
the<00:01:45.909> 500

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the 500

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.070 
the 500
so<00:01:47.610> you've<00:01:47.760> got<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.540> looks<00:01:48.660> like<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.870> lower

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
so you've got what looks like a lower

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.370 
so you've got what looks like a lower
lip<00:01:49.520> probably<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.580> wider<00:01:51.360> mouth<00:01:51.690> honeycomb

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
a TomTom nav you know classic old-school

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.469 
a TomTom nav you know classic old-school
style<00:04:31.020> I've<00:04:31.710> not<00:04:31.979> used<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.639> why<00:04:33.180> haven't<00:04:33.419> I

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
style I've not used it and why haven't I

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.810 
style I've not used it and why haven't I
used<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.900> because<00:04:33.930> when<00:04:34.560> you're<00:04:34.680> driving<00:04:34.949> the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
used it because when you're driving the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.370 
used it because when you're driving the
GPS<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.479> actually<00:04:36.840> in<00:04:36.900> your<00:04:37.020> line<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.199> vision

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
GPS is actually in your line of vision

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.980 
GPS is actually in your line of vision
so<00:04:38.030> I'm<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.090> little<00:04:39.300> reluctant<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.780> drive

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
so I'm a little reluctant to drive

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.210 
so I'm a little reluctant to drive
around<00:04:40.139> with<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.650> just<00:04:40.680> take<00:04:40.949> it<00:04:41.070> down

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
around with it so I just take it down

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.320 
around with it so I just take it down
and<00:04:41.550> throw<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.270> into<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.960> glovebox<00:04:44.330> so

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
and throw it into the the glovebox so

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.000 
and throw it into the the glovebox so
what<00:04:45.720> else<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:45.960> have<00:04:46.050> which<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.889> LAN

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
what else you have which is the LAN

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.430 
what else you have which is the LAN

much time to get used to it's got the

much time to get used to it's got the

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
dual mirror so it's going to extra wide

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.839

view<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.470> it's<00:05:13.560> really<00:05:14.220> confusing<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.789> eye

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849

and<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.510> don't<00:05:15.690> even<00:05:16.080> know<00:05:16.289> why<00:05:16.560> they'd<00:05:16.800> put<00:05:17.039> it

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
and I don't even know why they'd put it

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.700 
and I don't even know why they'd put it

in there so if I had to sum it up the

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
best way I can probably describe it it's
