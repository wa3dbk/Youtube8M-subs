00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 we give in a superior of about how 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.860
 download the minecraft because of editing 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.110

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 and good as we are on my cell phone 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.910
 also here on my cell phone 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.539
 I did not were 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.869
 first they will have to download the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.180
 description of the link and this will take you 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.640
 half a country, maybe I do not remember that the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.510
 I saw but the town wants to take a 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.630
 link those are downloaded into the file and 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.550
 now when they have downloaded it I go 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.760
 that is right now times allows you the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 zone 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.690
 samsung of 3000 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.250
 and the game is quite good and they eat 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 right now I have it installed 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 they are going to download 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.240
 in downloads on these computers the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.720
 they go to their archives where they have it 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.530
 here he opens all the file of the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.560
 good things I have it in him 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.090
 in day out card that is 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 an external card will double 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.399
 install or open the file that have been 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.090
 who had downloaded move 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.320
 minecraft because they said 0.9 point 5 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.900
 rt 4.0 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.770
 and then you have to say back here 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.320
 here apk 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 and if they will be downloaded from the other side what 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.970
 that is good prima 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.970
 they give him to install 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.220
 it's going to take a little longer and they 're 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.350
 taking 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.560
 well we continue after the little one 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.600
 cut 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.180
 now disgraces minecraft because they devote 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 fired applications and those that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.399
 they just have to do is give it to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.399
 open 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.220
 and since I have worlds because I already 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.790
 I had before and I deleted it then 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.070
 the game can be multiplayer we 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 it is looking good because it seems 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.430
 that is covering it but good 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.830
 but now right now with the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.850
 3 in the afternoon so it's pretty 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.750
 Clear 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.930
 then in this game you can cut 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.610
 the most player games and simply 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.110
 they have to open a world and it will look like 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.050
 pretty good the game 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.750
 this is version 10.9 points and it 's almost 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.670
 as the latest version of minecraft and 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.980
 contains new biomes and things like that 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.260
 you can also add texture father 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.140
 to lemon but it would be with an application 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.580
 apart from blog launcher system and if 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.110
 they want if they have enough attack this 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.060
 video 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.880
 I can do a tutorial on how to do it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.880
 so I 'm re debuted as always 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 forever 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.789
