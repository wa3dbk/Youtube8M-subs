00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.580 
pilot at Saab in Lynn chirping Sweden
I'm<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.029> standing<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.449> front<00:00:24.599> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.110> grip

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
I'm just standing in front of the grip

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.999 
I'm just standing in front of the grip
and<00:00:25.800> II<00:00:26.009> that<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:26.880> building<00:00:27.800> I'm<00:00:28.800> going

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
and II that we're now building I'm going

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.710 
and II that we're now building I'm going
to<00:00:29.070> give<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.310> few<00:00:29.490> examples<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
to give you a few examples of what the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
to give you a few examples of what the
grip<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.020> E<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.189> we've<00:00:32.340> done<00:00:32.520> from

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
grip in E is and what we've done from

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.570 
grip in E is and what we've done from
the<00:00:32.910> previous<00:00:33.269> versions<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:34.140> Gripen

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
the previous versions of the Gripen

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.030 
the previous versions of the Gripen
first<00:00:35.580> of<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.879> we<00:00:36.629> have<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.379> in<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.680> new<00:00:38.010> engine

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
first of all we have put in a new engine

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
first of all we have put in a new engine
so<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:38.970> have<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> grip<00:00:39.800> General<00:00:40.800> Electric

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
so now we have the grip General Electric

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.270 
so now we have the grip General Electric
for<00:00:41.550> 1/4<00:00:42.089> instead<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:42.989> 404<00:00:43.589> so<00:00:43.830> more<00:00:44.040> power

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
for 1/4 instead of the 404 so more power

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
for 1/4 instead of the 404 so more power
to<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.730> aircraft<00:00:45.589> we<00:00:46.589> also<00:00:46.800> moved<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to the aircraft we also moved the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
to the aircraft we also moved the
landing<00:00:48.030> gear<00:00:48.239> instead<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> folding<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
landing gear instead of folding into the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.299 
landing gear instead of folding into the
fuselage<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.789> moved<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> wing

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
fuselage we moved it out to the wing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.510 
fuselage we moved it out to the wing
root<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.629> more<00:00:54.870> space<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.559> fuel<00:00:56.039> inside

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
root to make more space for fuel inside

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
root to make more space for fuel inside
the<00:00:56.780> aircraft<00:00:58.969> by<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.780> also<00:01:00.809> make

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the aircraft by doing that we also make

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
the aircraft by doing that we also make
more<00:01:01.920> room<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.030> pilots<00:01:03.480> underneath

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
more room for two more pilots underneath

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.969 
more room for two more pilots underneath
underneath<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.280> fuselage<00:01:06.380> as<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.770> see

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
underneath the fuselage as you can see

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.389 
underneath the fuselage as you can see
on<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> aircraft<00:01:08.970> behind<00:01:09.270> me<00:01:10.100> other<00:01:11.100> things

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
on the aircraft behind me other things

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the aircraft behind me other things
we've<00:01:11.610> done<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.149> that<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.899> put<00:01:13.259> in<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.619> new

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we've done is that we have put in a new

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.550 
we've done is that we have put in a new
radar<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:14.970> front<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.440> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
radar in the front so we now have an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.669 
radar in the front so we now have an
elector<00:01:17.149> electrically<00:01:18.149> scanned<00:01:18.630> array<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
elector electrically scanned array the

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.120 
elector electrically scanned array the
selects<00:01:20.220> radar<00:01:21.170> giving<00:01:22.170> us<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.500> feel<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> regard

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
selects radar giving us a feel of regard

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.080 
selects radar giving us a feel of regard
from<00:01:23.340> plus<00:01:24.030> minus<00:01:24.390> 100<00:01:25.020> degrees<00:01:25.970> compared<00:01:26.970> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
from plus minus 100 degrees compared to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
from plus minus 100 degrees compared to
the<00:01:27.180> previous<00:01:27.570> plus<00:01:27.900> minus<00:01:28.229> 60<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.040> can

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the previous plus minus 60 so we can

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
the previous plus minus 60 so we can
actually<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.820> behind<00:01:30.030> ourself<00:01:30.540> now

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
actually look behind ourself now

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.450 
actually look behind ourself now
we<00:01:32.700> also<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.300> an<00:01:33.480> IR<00:01:33.930> s<00:01:34.260> T<00:01:34.740> mounted<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
we also have an IR s T mounted to the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.390 
we also have an IR s T mounted to the
aircraft<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.150> infrared<00:01:36.840> search<00:01:37.260> and<00:01:37.380> track<00:01:37.470> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
aircraft or infrared search and track so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.210 
aircraft or infrared search and track so
we<00:01:38.550> can<00:01:38.729> find<00:01:39.000> targets<00:01:39.920> while<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.070> going

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we can find targets while we're going

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.990 
we can find targets while we're going
completely<00:01:41.910> silent<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:43.430> avionics<00:01:44.430> system

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
completely silent the avionics system

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.680 
completely silent the avionics system
also<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.600> brand<00:01:46.320> new<00:01:46.410> completely<00:01:47.690> different

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
also is brand new completely different

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.760 
also is brand new completely different
Architecture<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.070> had<00:01:50.280> previously

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
Architecture from what we had previously

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
Architecture from what we had previously
the<00:01:52.770> main<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.400> big<00:01:53.640> difference<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.600> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the main and big difference is that we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.380 
the main and big difference is that we
have<00:01:55.170> separated<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.250> flight<00:01:56.940> critical

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
have separated now the flight critical

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
have separated now the flight critical
information<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.500> mission<00:01:58.770> critical

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
information to the mission critical

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.460 
information to the mission critical
information<00:01:59.460> that<00:02:00.390> means<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.050> can<00:02:01.290> do

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
information that means that we can do

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.749 
information that means that we can do
quick<00:02:02.130> upgrades<00:02:03.289> much<00:02:04.289> quicker<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:05.670> or

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
quick upgrades much quicker and more or

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
quick upgrades much quicker and more or
less<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.450> field<00:02:06.690> without<00:02:06.990> having<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
less out on the field without having to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.859 
less out on the field without having to
read<00:02:07.770> test<00:02:08.070> all<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.640> flight<00:02:09.420> critical

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
read test all the flight critical

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
read test all the flight critical
software<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.489> an<00:02:11.670> advantage

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
software so that will be an advantage

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.750 
software so that will be an advantage
for<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.600> customer<00:02:13.080> pricing<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.890> also<00:02:14.430> timing

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
for the customer pricing and also timing

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.510 
for the customer pricing and also timing
so<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.600> would<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:15.989> quicker<00:02:16.410> than<00:02:16.680> than

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
so we would be much quicker than than

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.320 
so we would be much quicker than than
previously<00:02:19.459> other<00:02:20.459> things<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> want<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
previously other things that I want to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.479 
previously other things that I want to
mention<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.900> aircraft<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:23.310> all

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
mention on this aircraft now with all

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.330 
mention on this aircraft now with all
these<00:02:23.700> new<00:02:24.239> pilots<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.130> behind

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
these new pilots as you can see behind
