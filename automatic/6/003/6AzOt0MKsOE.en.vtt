00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.780
 m 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.600
 and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.140
 well I will explain an exercise that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.350
 does on the natural minor scale in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.879
 tonality of the minor or in the case as 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.300
 this one at the end of the guitar now 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.580
 petrocini tone not a lower tone 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.150
 is going to be in the key of minor sun 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.150
 has two forms the first one is like this 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.799
 basically they are three equal figures that 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 they are transferred as we 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.560
 we are changing ropes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.760
 of boot on the fret 5 7 and 8 on the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 sixth 107 and 8 in the fifth and then 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.159
 go to 7 and 9 10 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.409
 in fourth and third and then go to 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.409
 the second and the first one in this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 the way to do it would be like this 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.320
 i 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.940
 that is , round trip 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.060
 this can be exercised you can always 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.459
 exercise without stopping without repeating in 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.459
 first note nor the last note 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.910
 and we have another way about it 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.540
 scale another way to do it and also 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.239
 they are three 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.650
 the same figure is repeated three times 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.140
 nothing more than this figure a little more 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.360
 open requires a little more opening 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.390
 hand in hand 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.240
 maybe it will focus 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.030
 57 32 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.380
 fifth and sixth afterwards if we do it in 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.460
 fourth and third in 7 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.460
 in 5 7 and 9 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.500
 and we do it in him 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.269
 in the fret 8 10 and 12 that we have left 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.269
 here 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.450
 and it is done and repeat the extreme notes 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.470
 you can exercise individually and 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.730
 can also be combined is required 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.440
 a little bit more coordination because 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.760
 it is assumed that when we do in the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.500
 first ong 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.500
 in this second figure that we are going to do 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.730
 we can not 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.900
 or we can do this in another way 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 and we can not 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.890
 it requires a lot of exercise and doing it 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.050
 at a speed so it is 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.050
 playing does not have to be done to great 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.600
 speed 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.040
 and very slow everything depends on the time in 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.140
 the one that starts but very useful because it 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.790
 You can use 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.180
 to start just a part of a single 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.660
 that one wants to compose let's say because 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.460
 basically 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.440
 we are struggling to guess if we are 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.730
 doing the tonality of the minor that 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.090
 normally with normal tuning 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.380
 it is 5 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.560
 good to start all this we're going to 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.560
 do 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.169
 but we have left, we can transfer it 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.939
 because in this figure 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.759
 we always start on the note that gives the 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.229
 everything minor and then what you have to 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.159
 know is that our figures only 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.159
 you have to lower a tone 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.670
 I hope it will
