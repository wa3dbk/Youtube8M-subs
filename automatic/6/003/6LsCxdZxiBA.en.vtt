00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.200
 and then gang beauty here said Felipe 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.969
 in this video that is a video tutorial is 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 come back showing you how you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.869
 will eliminate the problem of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.000
 incompatibility compatibility 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 graphics on your windows 7 windows vista 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.859
 is with the US come to style is it can 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.240
 be both with expansion that is the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.060
 to compete or not 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 anyway it 's the first of all the only thing 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.360
 already have that is to use the block 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 notes and I will pass a very 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 simple for you here six copy in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 of your computer and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 then I will explain why give in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 compatibility is because there is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.600
 this problem of windows 7 windows vista 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
 with an event in paris 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.260
 good if you open your notepad one 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.230
 new article will not have the following code 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 test the space bar space efe 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.489
 bar and m &amp; e explorer point this ze 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 then it is by a line and will put the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.330
 xez file from its axis 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.619
 eiji pops and 2 underline x 1 points says 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 Take another step and I will put the start 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 explorer point x is ready ran out 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.409
 code so now comes the normal part 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 that people are sometimes mistaken in 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.070
 time to do this and end up sounding like 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.530
 a txt file is actually not inter x 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 t which is the semec notepad pattern 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.189
 in file save as you choose to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 folder in case you are already in the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.720
 My name is microsoft games and already 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 prepares every two years for mx1 or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.750
 be the expansion that is the concrete 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.490
 I open here 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:53.010
 if you put the file name by 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:54.880
 example the file compatibility 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.810
 compatibility may be a name that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.540
 you want 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 anyway only in all files and this 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.080
 it's very important do not put dxt 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.010
 person will not work all the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.440
 files 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'm going to put it here. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.410
 you can see that you already have an example here 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.310
 in the program program will pay this 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.610
 here, and since it yields 2 x 1 with the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.380
 program crashes for example and I will 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.570
 save on low 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.820
 this is very important to the staff at 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.550
 here and mine here and acrylic paste 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.140
 to save and that's it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.020
 I'll open my folder here. 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.430
 Egypt and you'll see, let's see what the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 program will already be there 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.530
 so I came back here with my 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.500
 our program here program point betis 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.360
 target in the folder of the Egypt in itÃ¡qui you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.160
 you can see that the file description is 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.540
 which batch file in windows ie 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.670
 you can conclude that you are the ones 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.860
 steps correctly is not as it is 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.970
 normal txt text file such as 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.070
 point bete program 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.420
 from this you can start your 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.370
 axis 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 you can usually check that the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.959
 water will not have the effects 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.840
 graphics much less land 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:07.400
 good you can put a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.090
 laos and that what is the original icon is the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.890
 the file x and dodo and how to put 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.330
 other types of icons and your like 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.730
 You can do the following is also 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.519
 copy and paste on your desktop the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.910
 shortcut does not suit the normal personal 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.319
 and paste the shortcut and then you run 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.049
 the program over there makes it easier to 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.549
 have to stay coming at the farce of the 20 x 1 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.569
 tat 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.489
 Anyway, after that, just play personal 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 This was another video. 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.489
 I hope you have enjoyed it and the series of 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.110
 rts forever will continue our staff 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.549
 The next game you will see which is more 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 a well-known game that everyone already 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.660
 played of the jewelry if you like if you 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.250
 Likes to join the shared channel 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 the video with granny in clothes to pay 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.450
 finally is is it personal I am Felipe was 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.450
 One more video I went 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.170
