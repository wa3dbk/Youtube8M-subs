00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 I'm happy about the world in which my 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:12.610
 you who are flawed 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.590
 when you turn the steering wheel 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.150
 in my case I will come again when talking 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:23.050
 right 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:27.819
 it vibrated fiber cable all and even 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:31.929
 so you go crazy there and want to 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:34.800
 find out why it might be you barter 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:40.450
 suspension and continues to release 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.710
 I saw a video of the dg youtube, right? 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.740
 with corolla defect when you 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.340
 accelerates it also vibrates a chapter of the 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.760
 book 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:58.990
 in my case when I turned to the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:01.960
 right such a crime all then can 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:08.740
 It may be I'm not saying it's a 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.880
 problem in the visit that this piece 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.159
 my case 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 In my case, this one is good, right? 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.240
 perfect conditions 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.270
 she was on my left side was 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.090
 on the left side of the driver, right? 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.909
 this side when you turn left 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:38.320
 she did not the car vibrate right and that 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:43.540
 from here when I came right 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 the brawn car and there they told me 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 said that one side of the car has these 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 bearings here 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:01.240
 I was told that the other side the doctor 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.240
 in cases where the passenger has no 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.890
 so I kind of thought that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.060
 could be a mere lie 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.310
 so I asked my mechanic to come back, huh? 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.960
 and when it opened it really saw that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.190
 did not have spheres 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.280
 This trick and has a detail in football 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.280
 Argentine 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.700
 this visit will the left is that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:41.890
 here on the left side the driver who 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:48.970
 goes inside the box had the holidays and if 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:54.290
 this ethical or limina is of the width of 30 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.560
 the day of the team up to here 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.510
 30 minutes 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:07.010
 another detail here is 22 dance 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 this one on the left side of the driver 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.709
 22 of them and 30 millimeters 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.120
 this sound insulation on the right side 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.120
 that was where it vibrated 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.330
 I do not remember how many minutes I have but I 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.680
 I know you do not have time too if I 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.680
 I'm not mistaken and 27 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.860
 that already docked on the tulip is this side 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.680
 here 's what nature will spend and what 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.980
 happens when I took this party 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.610
 sample and put the other side in the house 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.140
 Passenger right side is fit 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.270
 perfectly in the tulip had no gap 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.530
 I've had too much sleep this evening. 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:02.340
 talking was without regulation is very 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.270
 detail her how sbt has 22 of them acts 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.870
 other side only has 21 right 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.730
 In this case what I did I got the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.810
 two ne 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:25.050
 I bought this one here and it's 30 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:27.120
 insulation and 21 of them then the 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.420
 I happened to put this practice 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.470
 It's not worthless, I 'm not going. 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.750
 Put this one here. 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.590
 stop at a grade problem 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.840
 the car when this is the right time to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.480
 you get crazy and I did not go crazy 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:51.380
 looking for this piece is a wiki in the box 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.380
 the spice is not 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:13.650
 afflicted with the cuf I paid value of 74 is 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.639
 she who pays order also took the team from 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.740
 real boots 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:26.880
 I week and this visit 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.890
 she served in Fiesta 1.0 and 1.6 2002 until 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.590
 2013 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.850
 so you did not stay taken this year 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.400
 trick 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:43.830
 if you do not think of that in argentina 9 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:50.040
 900 to 99 you so much that this new 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:52.919
 logic on display and there was also no show 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.340
 where there were also details in this case the 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:04.050
 silence because it works for others 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:10.590
 cars will also be found again so 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:15.390
 Easy the first time is it serves 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:20.910
 also for the emits the clicrbs and milan 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:28.650
 the club selic tango megane 1.6 also 16 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:30.419
 games and pg16 and a citroen c3 is for 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.070
 home you do not think 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:38.880
 you can look for one of these brands and 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:42.150
 also by the fiesta max parents and never 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.669
 I do not know if it 's good I did not 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.910
 find the original cast from the original 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.940
 I was not able to 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.120
 the tek that is where I usually buy 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.580
 so the vibration problem I hope 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.850
 be it because many think it was 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.750
 burst I changed I hope it is 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:06.800
 this small detail presents 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.540
 the recommendation of the right dg and so 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.530
 When asked what I do other 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.150
 saying that outside the deck is 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:21.610
 Perfect 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:21.610
 little my heart, a car
