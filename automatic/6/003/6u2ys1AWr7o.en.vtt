00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.040
 Ilya Spryzgalov riveted huge 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.469

 composition of the national team at home 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.430
 Eurotour stage but due to colds the goalkeeper 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 had to miss the tour 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 however, the departure of the squad and the national teams all 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.369
 equally made a lot of noise journalists 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.920
 started attacking a hockey player with a request 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 comment on the situation but ironic 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 the goalkeeper was brief quote us not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.360
 space suit astronaut and you understand 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 that he keeps me from communicating for now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 journalists wondered what he meant 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 splashes we fulfilled his dream 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.680
 childhood 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.680
 hero of the day space suit Ilya Sprygalov 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.220
 have some kind of dream day fly in 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.280
 space 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.990
 I step into the old ones while relaxing with us 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.990
 young must always come on roads 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 he has all the pills and I come to the training 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.990
 so what do we fly to space 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
 then we went 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.940
 crooked city but it's like a joystick and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.940
 shoe 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.630
 what jizz is there if about excitement on 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.170
 the blood has already arrived in logic 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.430
 it's in this position I'm a little bit 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.430
 not really comfortable 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.050
 stocking tearing you 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.510
 nice to meet you big 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.380
 the part for me is not interested in very much 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.390
 questions so you were there in space you 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 some kind of unearthly man as a bulk 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.880
 earthly saw the earth probably not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.680
 succumb to our earthly laws then yes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.410
 Well, tell me about coffee 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.200
 what interests me at all is cosmos and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.260
 I also study it a little more 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.880
 say so by the stars yes how 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 the universe was born like everyone else 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.650
 happened you were closer there closer 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.560
 have seen the stars tell us a little about 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.500
 They can say that the admirable 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 that you will be interested in this topic 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.600
 not all is now not the seventies 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.110
 years of the last century when dancing 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.150
 boys and girls dreamed there too 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.430
 to be either astronauts or pilots 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.650
 either there submariners cosmos once 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.690
 I feel it there but that's actually 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.130
 he is so cold so very tough you 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.049
 you see , all the stars were not there 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.090
 only our blue planet is bright there 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.010
 bright blue there you see her here she is 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.350
 so warm dear everything else in 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.330
 the cosmos what the human eye sees is 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.959
 absolutely cold ice 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.640
 dead in our understanding as a person 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.160
 biological living on 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.430
 it is because there a person can not live 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.410
 he is there radiation there besides this hall 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.230
 radiation you even go they instantly 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.100
 sometimes a person is killed 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.730
 this lack of pressure appearance by 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.750
 ball you a question tell you something 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.520
 seen there unusual but unusual there 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.990
 a lot does not usually begin with the fact that 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.990
 there really is no gravity 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.270
 well here it is the base unit base 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.270
 module 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.410
 and here is this table as we say worker 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.260
 he is a dining worker here too 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.540
 here is the kitchen the same thing is all that 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.330
 there is in fact even this PGK 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.760
 he looks like this 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.720
 this cabin is a real give and here it is 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 there is and what is 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.009
 Treadmill 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 Ilya us already we are rated in 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.840
 training astronauts and now probably 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.210
 a childhood dream come true and succeed 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.210
 trying on a spacesuit and an astronaut costume 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.190
 come out to consider that 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.150
 See this posture astronaut usually 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.610
 so bent because the astronaut 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.710
 usually from kav andre flies sit 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.939
 Greece therefore such a specialty to 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.559
 fountain plan 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:38.159

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:51.529
 I add some labor 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.529
 darth vader now from star wars

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.889
 child dreams began to realize already 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:40.320
 more on in adulthood what is 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:43.889
 cosmos is generally interested and well 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.330
