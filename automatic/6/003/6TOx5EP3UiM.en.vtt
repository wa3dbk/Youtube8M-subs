00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.870 
well this is one of our four wheel drive
tractors<00:01:51.530> here<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> now<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.400> wear<00:01:52.640> GPS

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
tractors here we have a now to wear GPS

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600 
tractors here we have a now to wear GPS
actually<00:01:53.660> can<00:01:54.590> run<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:54.950> things<00:01:55.190> they<00:01:55.460> go

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
actually can run these things they go

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490 
actually can run these things they go
down<00:01:55.760> straight<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.510> you<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.140> turn<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
down straight and you just turn it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
down straight and you just turn it
around<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.860> you'll<00:01:58.040> hit<00:01:58.160> a<00:01:58.220> button<00:01:58.460> once<00:01:59.210> it's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
around and you'll hit a button once it's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.760 
around and you'll hit a button once it's
all<00:01:59.479> set<00:01:59.720> up<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.990> it'll<00:02:00.140> go<00:02:00.290> down<00:02:00.320> straight

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
all set up and it'll go down straight

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.100 
all set up and it'll go down straight
again<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.070> that's<00:02:01.160> why<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.430> rose<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.000> look<00:02:02.930> so

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
again so that's why the rose now look so

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.090 
again so that's why the rose now look so
much<00:02:03.229> straighter<00:02:03.500> than<00:02:03.620> they<00:02:03.740> did<00:02:03.860> back<00:02:04.040> in

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
much straighter than they did back in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
much straighter than they did back in
the<00:02:04.310> past<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:05.330> controls<00:02:05.630> right<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:05.930> this

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
the past these controls right here this

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.990 
the past these controls right here this
is<00:02:06.590> your<00:02:06.950> throttle<00:02:07.190> actually<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.820> know<00:02:07.910> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
is your throttle actually you know to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.449 
is your throttle actually you know to
slow<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.360> down<00:02:08.390> speed<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.020> up<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.310> your

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
slow it down speed it up this is your

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.460 
slow it down speed it up this is your
shifter<00:02:10.970> right<00:02:11.120> here<00:02:11.420> it's<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> little

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
shifter right here it's a little

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.810 
shifter right here it's a little
different<00:02:12.650> than<00:02:12.950> what<00:02:13.100> I'm<00:02:13.190> used<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.520> but<00:02:13.610> uh

you know four miles an hour in this big

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.380 
you know four miles an hour in this big
piece<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> equipment<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:17.000> definitely<00:02:17.330> get

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
piece of equipment will definitely get

you going this is our number or yellow
number<00:02:21.980> two<00:02:22.190> corner<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:22.610> actually<00:02:22.970> grow<00:02:23.209> and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
number two corner we actually grow and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.540 
number two corner we actually grow and
this<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.800> head<00:02:24.980> right<00:02:25.190> here<00:02:25.370> will<00:02:25.489> actually

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
this is head right here will actually

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.729 
this is head right here will actually
shave<00:02:25.970> off<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.450> whole<00:02:26.690> tire<00:02:27.080> cob<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.410> we'll

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
shave off this whole tire cob and we'll

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.070 
shave off this whole tire cob and we'll
get<00:02:27.890> I'm<00:02:28.670> pretty<00:02:29.270> much<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> whole<00:02:29.540> majority

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
get I'm pretty much the whole majority

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.930 
get I'm pretty much the whole majority
of<00:02:30.110> every<00:02:30.440> single<00:02:30.650> kernel<00:02:30.950> here<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.640> also<00:02:31.790> have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
of every single kernel here we also have

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.670 
of every single kernel here we also have
a<00:02:32.030> piece<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.690> clipping<00:02:33.050> called<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> hopper

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
a piece of clipping called the hopper

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.160 
a piece of clipping called the hopper
cart<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.550> know<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:35.090> dump<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.480> go<00:02:35.780> so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
cart you know we we dump on the go so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.830 
cart you know we we dump on the go so
when<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> combine<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.120> dumps<00:02:38.420> out<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
when the combine is it dumps out and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.440 
when the combine is it dumps out and
then<00:02:39.140> it'll<00:02:39.440> go<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.890> it'll<00:02:40.160> dumped<00:02:41.030> by<00:02:41.150> one<00:02:41.330> if

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
then it'll go and it'll dumped by one if

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.540 
then it'll go and it'll dumped by one if
that's<00:02:41.570> left<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:42.980> semis<00:02:43.400> and
