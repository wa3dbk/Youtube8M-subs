understand you I am now speaking to my

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.140 
understand you I am now speaking to my
computer<00:00:15.890> the<00:00:16.890> computer<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> learning<00:00:17.880> the

computer the computer is learning the
sound<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.810> voice<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> speak<00:00:20.869> this<00:00:21.869> will

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
sound of my voice as I speak this will

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
sound of my voice as I speak this will
help<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> computer<00:00:22.769> better<00:00:23.130> recognize<00:00:23.760> what

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
help the computer better recognize what

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.130 
help the computer better recognize what
I<00:00:24.119> say<00:00:25.640> speech<00:00:26.640> recognition<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.660> recognize

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I say speech recognition can recognize

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.179 
I say speech recognition can recognize
many<00:00:28.500> speakers<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.490> accurately<00:00:31.189> but

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
many speakers very accurately but

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
many speakers very accurately but
training<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> computer<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.329> provide<00:00:33.600> an
