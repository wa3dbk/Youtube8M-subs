point in the game he did prevent

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
point in the game he did prevent
economic<00:00:52.289> economic<00:00:52.770> damage<00:00:53.219> early<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
economic economic damage early on to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
economic economic damage early on to
himself<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.539> he<00:00:55.050> went<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.350> push

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
himself but then as he went for push

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
himself but then as he went for push
that<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.309> sure<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> be

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that I was so sure that was going to be

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
that I was so sure that was going to be
successful<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:58.079> did<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> follow<00:00:58.739> through<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
successful he did not follow through and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
successful he did not follow through and
eventually<00:01:00.449> didn't<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.960> any<00:01:01.350> sort<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.739> damage

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
eventually didn't do any sort of damage

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
eventually didn't do any sort of damage
so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> believe<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> end<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.510> kind

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so I believe in the end that's what kind

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.039 
so I believe in the end that's what kind
of<00:01:03.930> started<00:01:05.000> pretty<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.390> cost<00:01:06.750> him

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
of started pretty much what cost him

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
of started pretty much what cost him
there<00:01:09.020> let's<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.439> what's<00:01:10.830> he<00:01:11.040> what's<00:01:11.909> he

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060

go around do some damage but I don't
think<00:07:15.659> really<00:07:15.839> any<00:07:16.020> base<00:07:16.289> is<00:07:16.469> vulnerable<00:07:16.949> for

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
think really any base is vulnerable for

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.439 
think really any base is vulnerable for
