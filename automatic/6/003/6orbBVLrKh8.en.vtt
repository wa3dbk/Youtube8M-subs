00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.069
 andrew and in this video show how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.270
 nice to cut the apples while I'm not 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.550
 I will use no fixtures 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.900
 surely all sorts of restaurants and movies 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.370
 seen how to serve fruit in shape 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.080
 different shapes now we will do 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 the same but before continuing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.320
 I will recommend for you very interesting 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.940
 it has a large enough channel 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.740
 the number of viewers I have about him already 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 once told but so cool that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.279
 i can't help but do it more tricks and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 tricks scientific experiments all this is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.670
 on the channel with very interest and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.529
 watches the author explain everything 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 very clear everything explains to me personally 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.439
 lucky to meet the author 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 talk closer that's why i 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.649
 I recommend his channel again if you want 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 subscribe click here or 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.980
 follow the link in the description but now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 I will tell you how to chop 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.489
 apples for this we need two 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.590
 identical knife and knife which we will 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 cut but also apple to start apple 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 you need to cut exactly in half and you club 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930
 rate point 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.790
 then take 2 legs and place between 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 Apple cut half of the apple 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.370
 before the cutting knife rests on 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.370
 the rest of the knife 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.070
 Further we do everything in the same way only with 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.070
 another plane 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.580
 the halves that cut off need to be removed 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.020
 but don't throw it away because everything 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.909
 the following procedure we will conduct 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.530
 with them just as well put this 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.369
 half between two knives and cut 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.369
 as previous 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.800
 so you need to repeat until cut off 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.800
 part will not become very small 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.980
 Now all that we cut is to add 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.980
 single whole 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.970
 menu 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.260
 now it all remotely reminds 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.510
 swans but do not need to cut to the end 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.380
 the head of Yuriev and the other left hanging 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.380
 half apple 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.310
 such here are beautiful swan shaped apples 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.990
 I got it turned out a little 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 neater than this because when it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.070
 doing no hurry at all when 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 filmed so it will be much worse if 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.830
