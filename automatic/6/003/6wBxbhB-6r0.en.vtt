are<00:01:14.100> no<00:01:14.570> fucking<00:01:15.570> no<00:01:15.600> good<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.560> least<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.950> my

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
are no fucking no good at least in my

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
are no fucking no good at least in my
opinion<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.090> switch<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> peeping

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
opinion now I do switch to the peeping

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.010 
opinion now I do switch to the peeping
right<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.430> don't<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.729> why<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
right here and I don't know why I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.300 
right here and I don't know why I
decided<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> instead<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> minus

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
decided to use that instead of the minus

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
decided to use that instead of the minus
Z<00:01:23.549> honestly<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.259> fucking

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
Z honestly I think that the fucking

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
Z honestly I think that the fucking
pp-2000<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.970> shoots<00:01:27.210> longer<00:01:27.869> lines

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
pp-2000 actually shoots longer lines

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.130 
pp-2000 actually shoots longer lines
then<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.840> 10<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> fucking<00:01:32.570> mini<00:01:33.570> uzi<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then the 10 the fucking mini uzi but I

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.510 
then the 10 the fucking mini uzi but I
wasn't<00:01:34.380> using<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.710> javelin<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.280> point

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
wasn't using my javelin at this point

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960 
wasn't using my javelin at this point
because<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.119> figured<00:01:36.619> javelin<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.970> trailer

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
because I figured javelin on a trailer

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880
