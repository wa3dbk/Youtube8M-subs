lowepro edge to the Zr to the zr2 and

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.260 
lowepro edge to the Zr to the zr2 and
there's<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.130> new<00:01:27.250> improvement<00:01:27.790> with<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:27.940> zr2

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
there's a new improvement with a zr2

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.520 
there's a new improvement with a zr2
that's<00:01:28.630> actually<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.990> major<00:01:29.259> improvement

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
that's actually a major improvement

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's actually a major improvement
forward<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.590> GPS<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.950> it's<00:01:33.520> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
forward and that is the GPS and it's a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.609 
forward and that is the GPS and it's a
zero<00:01:33.820> point<00:01:34.090> system<00:01:34.450> basically<00:01:34.780> what<00:01:35.200> happens

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
zero point system basically what happens

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.770 
zero point system basically what happens
is<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.830> guitar<00:01:36.190> stays<00:01:36.909> in<00:01:36.940> tune<00:01:37.390> no<00:01:37.600> matter

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
great thing about the short tracer is
it's<00:02:21.200> got<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> lot<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.860> output<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.790> sit

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's got a lot of output so it can sit

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.369 
it's got a lot of output so it can sit
recessed<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.690> string<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.140> you've<00:02:24.230> got<00:02:24.260> a

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
recessed from the string so you've got a

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.140 
recessed from the string so you've got a
little<00:02:24.620> bit<00:02:24.709> more<00:02:24.860> room<00:02:25.040> here<00:02:25.099> as<00:02:25.580> you're

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
little bit more room here as you're

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.850 
little bit more room here as you're
playing<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.540> moving<00:02:26.810> closer<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.650> further

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
playing and moving closer and further

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.990 
playing and moving closer and further
away<00:02:28.069> from<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.370> ridge<00:02:28.580> with<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:28.879> right<00:02:28.970> hand

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
away from the ridge with your right hand

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:43.300 
away from the ridge with your right hand
that's<00:02:29.599> pretty<00:02:29.720> cool

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.619 

one<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.459> places<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.940> really<00:02:45.180> discover<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
one of the places you really discover a

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.270 
one of the places you really discover a
lot<00:02:45.840> about<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.110> guitar<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.590> taking<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.010> into<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
lot about a guitar is taking it into the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
sound it's strong the zero point system

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.450 
sound it's strong the zero point system
allows<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.930> do<00:04:12.990> to<00:04:13.080> wacky<00:04:13.380> crazy<00:04:13.890> things

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
allows you to do to wacky crazy things

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.699 
allows you to do to wacky crazy things
with<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.880> tremolo<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.480> essentially<00:04:16.350> let<00:04:16.500> go

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
with the tremolo and essentially let go

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.070 
with the tremolo and essentially let go
it<00:04:16.980> returns<00:04:17.370> back<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.940> zero<00:04:18.209> point<00:04:18.540> where

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
it returns back to that zero point where

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.530 
it returns back to that zero point where
everything's<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.739> tune<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.760> stable<00:04:21.269> right

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
where you left it even though the guitar

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.160 
where you left it even though the guitar
doesn't<00:04:23.850> have<00:04:24.000> locking<00:04:24.240> nut<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.750> tremolo

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
doesn't have locking nut this tremolo

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.900 
doesn't have locking nut this tremolo
does<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> wonderful<00:04:25.890> job<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.250> staying<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.700> tune

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
does a wonderful job of staying in tune

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.460 
does a wonderful job of staying in tune
even<00:04:27.600> when<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:27.810> tend<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.260> abuse<00:04:28.590> it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470
