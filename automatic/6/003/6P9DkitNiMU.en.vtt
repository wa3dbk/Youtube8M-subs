00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.899
 shooting from the rooftop pool 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.890
 ship 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.740
 it's Complicated 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.280
 skyscrapers on the roof of the ship and in the ship 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.280
 water and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:25.810
 Now we've got a big city, here I am and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.089
 then click the mother wants 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.369
 hello this is a channel about oxford science 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.719
 and education and hopefully this comic 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.059
 video you have fun 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.370
 I just wanted to show you what to teach 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.329
 math you can get very 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.140
 see high even in the pool at a high-rise 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.120
 marina bay 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.720
 In this video, I would like to tell you 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 about how cool it is to be a mathematician and what 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.159
 opportunities given by this specialty as 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.559
 I think when we are 17-18 years old and we 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.500
 should choose a direction 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.629
 the education you want to get on 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.479
 my mind many of us don't know what 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.220
 they want and in that sense i would 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.799
 unequivocally recommended math 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 because if you have 1 education 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.070
 maths 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.159
 if you studied math then 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 then you can practically master 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.799
 any profession if you studied at 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.520
 mathematics and then suddenly decided to change 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.400
 your profile 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
 no one bothers you for a breast Master of 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.630
 some other specialty 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.499
 very many of my classmates stuck 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.960
 field of activity and after mehmat mgu 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:39.049
 don't know some guys went to work 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.810
 blacksmiths and now they are very talented 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.299
 masters working in Moscow, someone went 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 work in advertising someone went to work 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:52.729
 and finance someone is engaged in trade 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.490
 shares on the stock exchange and someone in science 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.889
 naturally stayed if we turn to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.639
 the experience of the ancient Greeks but how are you possible 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.560
 you know they thought mathematics was some 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.479
 gymnastics for the mind that is how 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360
 physical gymnastics develops our 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.050
 body so math develops our 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.569
 intelligence 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.880
 another one of the benefits of math is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.580
 that this is generally a complex science and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.490
 difficult specialty but how are you well 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.010
 do you understand thanks to this then 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.050
 life will be much less competition 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.330
 that is, you need five years 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.090
 try to really work but 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.650
 then 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.110
 few people will be able to take up 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 the work for which you can take 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.160
 and as a result you will have the whole 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.760
 life you can choose 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.519
 everything, that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.790
 just want to say for information 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.480
 if we take my classmates by 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.269
 mekhmata 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.599
 then by experience after about 2 maybe 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.220
 one year of work after graduation from 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.900
 university many have reached the level 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 head of analytical department in the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.879
 or another company by example 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.549
 I can say that after graduation from 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.390
 University I got a job at 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.790
 large enough company it was 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.400
 publishing house somewhere around 5,000 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.280
 man size company and they took me 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.799
 organizational development manager 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.079
 so after one and a half months of work 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.079
 they offered me to become a deputy there 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.389
 Head of Analytical Department to me 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.510
 it seems hardly such a career 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:35.450
 free of charge maybe this is another area 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.670
 but if you are a mathematician then it is in front of you 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.670
 all roads are open besides 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.329
 I would still note that 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.720
 science and mathematics know this 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.269
 international universal science and this 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.069
 language knows the whole world speaks it all 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.530
 the world and this subject this specialty she 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.069
 recognized worldwide if you have 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.310
 such qualifications are certainly yours 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.319
 abilities your knowledge will be 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.400
 universal across the planet in contrast 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.010
 let's say for example from doctors or lawyers 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.209
 I almost forgot 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.989
 of course math 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:22.099
 she also know artistically beautiful 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.320
 this is some such absolute it means she 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.949
 she is like pure water unlike others 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.159
 sciences in mathematics 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.159
 there is a system of axioms this is a set of rules 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.650
 who here are absolute they are unshakable they 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.990
 are taken and one already lined up 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.159
 the rest of the structure all the laws in 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.349
 math and here it is this cleanliness and and 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.940
 absoluteness you understand there is not some 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.680
 duality there is no politics 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.940
 everything is absolutely clear everything is crystal 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.940
 clear and thanks to this with their mathematicians 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.190
 itâ€™s impossible to argue with them there either 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.130
 yes or no and here in this and and beauty and in 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.990
 principle, thanks to this , 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.980
 mathematicians say for example there 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.850
 statistics 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.700
 everyone listens and everyone accepts it 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.910
 You know what absolute truth with 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.190
 no one argues with them they are authoritative and 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.190
 you will not have 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.400
 you know how can lawyers have or 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.360
 historians can argue about something 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.510
 discuss 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.910
 there are different approaches methodology here in 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.330
 math no math she 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.760
 or 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:43.390
 black or white and so let's say your 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.850
 idea if it is really true if 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.250
 she's right no one here 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.470
 refute looking there for political 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.950
 considerations or from some approach 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.540
 that is, if she is so that it is so 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.850
 what choose math 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.190
 well and as you see it is already completely dark 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.690
 so it's time for us to wrap up if you 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.880
 like this video then subscribe 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.880
