country baking which would be to make
some<00:00:11.280> cornbread<00:00:12.170> what<00:00:13.170> I've<00:00:13.320> done<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.889> I've

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
some cornbread what I've done is I've

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.210 
some cornbread what I've done is I've
taken<00:00:14.839> America's<00:00:15.839> favorite<00:00:16.410> jiffy<00:00:17.190> corn

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.310 
taken America's favorite jiffy corn
muffin<00:00:17.580> mix<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:19.529> I've<00:00:19.920> divided<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.670> into<00:00:21.300> some

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.910 

essentially<00:00:25.320> 1/3<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> mix<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.680> I've<00:00:28.680> used

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
essentially 1/3 of the mix and I've used

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.990 
essentially 1/3 of the mix and I've used
some<00:00:29.189> powdered<00:00:29.670> eggs<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:31.520> some<00:00:32.520> powdered

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
some powdered eggs and some powdered

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.920 
some powdered eggs and some powdered
whole<00:00:33.329> milk<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.690> out

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
whole milk so that I can take these out

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.459 
whole milk so that I can take these out
on<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> trail<00:00:37.530> without<00:00:37.710> any<00:00:38.040> difficulty<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
on the trail without any difficulty I

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
on the trail without any difficulty I
did<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.640> batch<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> oven<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.899> 400

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
did make one batch in the oven at 400

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.220 
did make one batch in the oven at 400
degrees<00:00:43.829> took<00:00:44.309> 18<00:00:44.730> minutes<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> what

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
degrees took 18 minutes and this is what

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.029 
degrees took 18 minutes and this is what
I'm<00:00:46.559> aiming<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.320> what<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> use

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'm aiming for and what I'm going to use

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.500 
I'm aiming for and what I'm going to use
is<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> pan<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.219> I've<00:00:53.520> devised<00:00:53.969> that's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is a is a pan that I've devised that's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.279 
is a is a pan that I've devised that's
made<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.820> tooling<00:00:56.820> aluminum<00:00:57.390> 36<00:00:57.989> gauge

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
made out of tooling aluminum 36 gauge

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
made out of tooling aluminum 36 gauge
and<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.739> soft<00:00:59.010> enough<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.449> bent

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and is soft enough that it can be bent

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.070 
and is soft enough that it can be bent
into<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.260> pan<00:01:01.620> shape<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.899> I've

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
into a pan shape like this and then I've

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.359 
into a pan shape like this and then I've
got<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.769> piece<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.990> titanium<00:01:06.990> foil<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.220> I'm

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
got a piece of titanium foil that I'm

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.270 
got a piece of titanium foil that I'm
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> use<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> heat<00:01:09.390> shield<00:01:09.979> under<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
going to use as a heat shield under the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to use as a heat shield under the
baking<00:01:11.909> pan<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.540> top<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> Firefly<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
baking pan on top of the Firefly and in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.649 
baking pan on top of the Firefly and in
between<00:01:14.790> those<00:01:15.299> I've<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> spacer<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
between those I've just got a spacer and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.969 
between those I've just got a spacer and
the<00:01:18.659> whole<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.710> topped

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the whole thing is going to be topped

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.660 
the whole thing is going to be topped
off<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:21.110> foil<00:01:22.110> hood<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.280> here

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
off with a foil hood that you see here

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.830 
off with a foil hood that you see here
and<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> let's<00:01:25.890> go<00:01:26.610> ahead<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and so let's go ahead and get the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
and so let's go ahead and get the
Firefly<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:31.610> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Firefly going and see how we do so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
Firefly going and see how we do so
basically<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.750> using<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
basically I'm going to be using the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580 
basically I'm going to be using the
Firefly<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> Flex<00:01:35.880> port<00:01:36.329> mode<00:01:36.659> open<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
Firefly with the Flex port mode open and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.819 
Firefly with the Flex port mode open and
that's<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.210> feed<00:01:39.479> wood<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.049> which

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that's so that I can feed wood in which

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.770 
that's so that I can feed wood in which
will<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.040> easier<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> regulate<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> baking

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
will be easier to regulate the baking

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.980 
will be easier to regulate the baking
temperature<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.470> keep<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> fire<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
temperature and keep the fire going for

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
temperature and keep the fire going for
up<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.290> 20<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.490> suppose<00:01:47.850> even<00:01:48.090> 30<00:01:48.479> minutes

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
up to 20 and I suppose even 30 minutes

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.190 
up to 20 and I suppose even 30 minutes
I'm<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.229> sure<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.560> long<00:01:49.799> it'll<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.310> bake

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.040 

oK<00:01:57.200> we've<00:01:57.530> got<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.920> fire<00:01:58.130> started<00:01:58.930> but<00:01:59.930> I'm

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
oK we've got the fire started but I'm

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.900 
oK we've got the fire started but I'm
gonna<00:02:00.170> let<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.530> burn<00:02:00.800> down<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.130> little<00:02:01.430> bit<00:02:01.640> to

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
gonna let that burn down a little bit to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.120 
gonna let that burn down a little bit to
some<00:02:02.120> coals<00:02:02.510> before<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.170> start<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.740> use<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
some coals before I start to use the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.730 
some coals before I start to use the
Flex<00:02:04.430> port<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.540> baking<00:02:08.560> mixed<00:02:09.560> up

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
Flex port and get the baking mixed up

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.890 
Flex port and get the baking mixed up
and<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:10.520> gonna<00:02:10.700> go<00:02:10.880> ahead<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.180> mix<00:02:11.450> up<00:02:11.690> my

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and I'm gonna go ahead and mix up my

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.140 
and I'm gonna go ahead and mix up my
cornbread<00:02:12.320> mix<00:02:12.800> while<00:02:13.400> I'm<00:02:13.580> waiting<00:02:16.120> okay<00:02:17.120> I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
cornbread mix while I'm waiting okay I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.800 
cornbread mix while I'm waiting okay I
think<00:02:17.300> we're<00:02:17.630> ready<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.140> put<00:02:18.350> everything<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:19.130> I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
think we're ready to put everything on I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.950 
think we're ready to put everything on I
have<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.670> muffin<00:02:22.670> mix<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.330> baking<00:02:23.690> pan

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
have the muffin mix in the baking pan

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.220 
have the muffin mix in the baking pan
which<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.470> greased<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.160> little<00:02:25.520> margarine

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
which I greased with a little margarine

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.400 
which I greased with a little margarine
so<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.380> first<00:02:27.620> step<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.430> put<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:30.910> titanium

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
so the first step is to put the titanium

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:42.460 
so the first step is to put the titanium
sheet<00:02:33.410> on<00:02:38.320> kind<00:02:39.320> of<00:02:39.470> Center<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:42.080> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
sheet on kind of Center that on the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.810 
sheet on kind of Center that on the
thing<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.880> spacer<00:02:45.490> then<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
thing and then the spacer then the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:54.750 
thing and then the spacer then the
baking<00:02:47.240> pan<00:02:47.480> goes<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:50.410> finally<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.720> foot

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
baking pan goes on and finally the foot

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.030 
baking pan goes on and finally the foot
you<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.450> kind<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.959> windy<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:57.860> we'll

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
you can see it's kind of windy so we'll

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.340 
you can see it's kind of windy so we'll
see<00:02:58.250> how<00:02:58.430> well<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.850> works<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:02.630> I've<00:03:02.959> got<00:03:03.170> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
see how well this works but I've got the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.120 
see how well this works but I've got the
baking<00:03:03.769> hood<00:03:04.959> kind<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.200> set<00:03:06.470> up<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.890> can

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
baking hood kind of set up so I can

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.570 
baking hood kind of set up so I can
still<00:03:07.459> feed<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> fire<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.980> baking<00:03:10.340> hood

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
still feed the fire and the baking hood

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.940 
still feed the fire and the baking hood
has<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> little<00:03:11.330> hole<00:03:11.600> in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.019> top<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.560> let<00:03:12.739> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
has a little hole in the top to let the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.770 
has a little hole in the top to let the
heat<00:03:13.190> out<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.790> he<00:03:14.510> smoke<00:03:14.870> out<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.140> top

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.920 

and<00:03:20.340> I'm<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.610> going<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.820> start<00:03:22.150> timeing<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
and I'm just going to start timeing and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.220 
and I'm just going to start timeing and
see<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.350> long<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.650> takes<00:03:24.450> for<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.750> bake<00:03:25.960> to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
see how long it takes for the bake to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.870 
see how long it takes for the bake to
happen<00:03:27.840> check<00:03:28.840> back<00:03:29.080> in<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.590> bit

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.900 

okay<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:34.930> windy<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.370> can<00:03:36.490> kind<00:03:36.790> of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
okay as windy as it is you can kind of

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.180 
okay as windy as it is you can kind of
see<00:03:37.590> I've<00:03:38.590> had<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.990> lean<00:03:40.990> some<00:03:41.440> sticks<00:03:41.920> up

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
see I've had to lean some sticks up

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.210 
see I've had to lean some sticks up
against<00:03:42.760> my<00:03:43.440> aluminum<00:03:44.440> foil<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:47.040> keep<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
against my aluminum foil to keep the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.250 
against my aluminum foil to keep the
wind<00:03:48.430> from<00:03:48.550> blowing<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.150> away<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.930> seems

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
wind from blowing it away but that seems

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.980 
wind from blowing it away but that seems
to<00:03:50.380> be<00:03:50.620> working<00:03:51.010> okay

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
to be working okay

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.470 
to be working okay

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and what I'm trying to do with the fire

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.370 
and what I'm trying to do with the fire
is<00:03:55.990> obviously<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:56.980> need<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.310> keep<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.820> going<00:03:58.380> but

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
is obviously I need to keep it going but

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.330 
is obviously I need to keep it going but
I'm<00:03:59.560> trying<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.010> keep<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.520> kind<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:02.340> on

the low burn and the flex port is really

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.240 
the low burn and the flex port is really
helping<00:04:10.030> me<00:04:10.180> do<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.360> because<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.440> can<00:04:11.860> see<00:04:12.100> the

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.010 
came out of the oven at 400 degrees for
18<00:06:00.920> minutes<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:02.120> one<00:06:02.300> on<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.480> left<00:06:02.810> is

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
18 minutes and the one on the left is

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.010 
18 minutes and the one on the left is
the<00:06:03.260> one<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.440> just<00:06:03.560> baked<00:06:04.010> on<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.250> Firefly<00:06:05.020> so

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
the one I just baked on the Firefly so

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.870 
the one I just baked on the Firefly so
let's<00:06:06.290> take<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.650> out<00:06:06.920> of<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.250> baking<00:06:07.610> pan<00:06:07.820> and

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
let's take it out of the baking pan and

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.070 
let's take it out of the baking pan and
see<00:06:08.270> what<00:06:08.420> it<00:06:08.480> looks<00:06:08.660> like<00:06:12.370> hopefully<00:06:13.750> as<00:06:14.750> much

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
see what it looks like hopefully as much

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.190 
see what it looks like hopefully as much
as<00:06:15.290> I<00:06:15.440> grease<00:06:15.770> this<00:06:16.070> up<00:06:16.690> it's<00:06:17.690> going<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:17.930> come

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
as I grease this up it's going to come

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.140 
as I grease this up it's going to come
out<00:06:18.230> easily<00:06:18.950> one<00:06:19.190> of<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.340> nice<00:06:19.580> things<00:06:19.610> about

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
out easily one of the nice things about

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.460 
out easily one of the nice things about
the<00:06:20.510> bendable<00:06:20.930> aluminum<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:22.250> that<00:06:23.170> it's<00:06:24.170> not

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
the bendable aluminum is that it's not

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.150 
the bendable aluminum is that it's not
rigid<00:06:24.800> makes<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.790> easier<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.620> sort<00:06:27.620> of<00:06:27.710> take<00:06:27.950> it

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
rigid makes it easier to sort of take it

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.460 
rigid makes it easier to sort of take it
away<00:06:28.250> from<00:06:28.730> baked<00:06:29.000> goods<00:06:29.330> than<00:06:29.540> that<00:06:32.350> so<00:06:33.350> it's

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
away from baked goods than that so it's

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.660 
away from baked goods than that so it's
coming<00:06:33.710> out<00:06:33.980> pretty<00:06:34.430> nicely<00:06:36.220> let's<00:06:37.220> see<00:06:37.460> how

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
coming out pretty nicely let's see how

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.700 
coming out pretty nicely let's see how
it<00:06:37.820> is<00:06:37.940> on<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.300> bottom<00:06:38.720> you<00:06:38.930> kind<00:06:39.140> of<00:06:39.350> see<00:06:39.500> how

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
it is on the bottom you kind of see how

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:48.130 
it is on the bottom you kind of see how
this<00:06:39.920> folds<00:06:40.370> flat<00:06:40.550> by<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:40.940> way<00:06:46.300> so<00:06:47.300> there's

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
this folds flat by the way so there's

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.180 
this folds flat by the way so there's
what<00:06:48.440> the<00:06:48.590> pan<00:06:48.830> looks<00:06:49.160> like<00:06:49.490> when<00:06:50.420> we're<00:06:50.600> done

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
what the pan looks like when we're done

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.270 
what the pan looks like when we're done
really<00:06:52.190> held<00:06:52.430> up<00:06:52.640> fine<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:54.620> this<00:06:54.830> can<00:06:55.100> go<00:06:55.250> right

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
really held up fine so this can go right

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.980 
really held up fine so this can go right
into<00:06:55.760> your<00:06:56.180> pouch<00:06:57.940> and<00:06:58.940> here's<00:06:59.270> the<00:06:59.510> cornbread
