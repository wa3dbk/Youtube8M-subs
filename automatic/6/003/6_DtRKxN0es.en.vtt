actually ganked where you're gonna put

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.160 
actually ganked where you're gonna put
the<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.520> tube<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:06.870> runs

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
the the tube in here so that it runs

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.580 
the the tube in here so that it runs
smoothly<00:00:07.649> allowing<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.670> heads<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.030> move

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
smoothly allowing the heads to move

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.110 
smoothly allowing the heads to move
while<00:00:10.590> also<00:00:10.950> making<00:00:11.219> sure<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.639> doesn't<00:00:11.700> get

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
while also making sure that doesn't get

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
while also making sure that doesn't get
in<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> way<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> anything<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:14.009> that

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
in the way of anything and for that

in the way of anything and for that
we're<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> use<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.389> clip<00:00:15.690> here

tubes in place here and then I'm going

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.759 
tubes in place here and then I'm going
to<00:00:29.910> secure<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.449> flap<00:00:30.720> where<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
then we'll stick it so firstly let's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
then we'll stick it so firstly let's
just<00:00:34.860> work<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.910> guy<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.050> needs

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to it needs to just come right into

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
to it needs to just come right into
between<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> gap<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.610> thing<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
between that gap so the first thing I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.920 
between that gap so the first thing I
need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> click

need to do is I'm going to need to click
it<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.500> side<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.670> reclaim

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it in on this side so that I can reclaim

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.709 
it in on this side so that I can reclaim
the<00:00:45.239> space<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> let's<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the space that I had there so let's just

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.319 
the space that I had there so let's just
try<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.530> work<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:49.980> guy<00:00:50.430> back<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.090> there

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
try and work this guy back into there

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
try and work this guy back into there
this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> bird<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> tricky<00:00:53.219> thing<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this is a bird of a tricky thing and as

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
this is a bird of a tricky thing and as
I<00:00:53.730> said<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.210> use<00:00:54.449> force<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.309> because

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
I said don't you use force here because

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
I said don't you use force here because
these<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.149> plastic<00:00:57.600> parts<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.109> you're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
these are just plastic parts and you're

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
these are just plastic parts and you're
likely<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.829> break<00:00:59.039> something<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.760> push

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
likely to break something if you push

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:13.789 
likely to break something if you push
too<00:01:00.449> hard<00:01:10.700> yeah<00:01:11.900> also<00:01:12.900> important<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
too hard yeah also important not to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.780 
too hard yeah also important not to
actually<00:01:14.390> puncture<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.600> damage<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.280> tubes<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
actually puncture or damage the tubes on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually puncture or damage the tubes on
this<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.689> need<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> work<00:01:20.040> them

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this side so you just need to work them

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
this side so you just need to work them
through<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.700> yeah<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.560> come<00:01:22.710> back

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
through there yeah and then come back

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
through there yeah and then come back
this<00:01:23.040> side<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.670> should<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.090> we've<00:01:24.180> got

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this side and I should have we've got

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
this side and I should have we've got
this<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.650> yep

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
this in here yep

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
this in here yep
and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:28.670> once<00:01:29.670> again<00:01:29.970> use<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.420> screwdriver

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and then once again use your screwdriver

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.090 
and then once again use your screwdriver
it's<00:01:31.170> probably<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> bad<00:01:31.829> idea<00:01:33.920> try<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it's probably not a bad idea try and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's probably not a bad idea try and
just<00:01:36.000> wedge<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.350> sure

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
just wedge this back and then make sure

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.440 
just wedge this back and then make sure
that<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:39.170> yeah<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:44.450> make

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that it's in here yeah and just make

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
that it's in here yeah and just make
sure<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> before<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.320> click<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.740> place

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950

that there's a bit of room for this car
to<00:01:48.479> move<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.049> we're<00:01:49.200> still<00:01:49.350> going

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
on the tubes here so we can position

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600 
on the tubes here so we can position
them<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> right<00:02:44.640> place

clip<00:03:27.410> right<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.769> here<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> see<00:03:29.400> there's<00:03:29.579> a

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
clip right on here so you see there's a

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.280 
clip right on here so you see there's a
bit<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.880> there's<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.209> service<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.810> ridges

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
bit of a there's a service with ridges

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.050 
bit of a there's a service with ridges
hand<00:03:31.590> there's<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.890> surface<00:03:32.310> which<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.730> quite
