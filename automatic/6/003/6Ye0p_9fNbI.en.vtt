00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.520
 Take a little hair strand first 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:59.750
 scroll and thread it through 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.750
 bandage stretching the tip of the strands below 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.960
 now take from the side yet 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.790

 pass them through the bandage take 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.380
 the next strand we attach it to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.650
 elongated strands scroll through 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.650
 through the bandage and pull the strand from below and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.350
 so you are doing quite hair yet 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.350
 don't get to the other end of the head 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.050
 try to detach strands with 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.000
 the sides were the same size as 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.970
 take strands for this hairstyle 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.210
 thin or wider it is up to you 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 a lot also depends on the density 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.870
 hair 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.970
 if you have thick and heavy hair 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.970
 it is desirable to take strands thinner 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.670
 hide the last hide and seek under 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.670
 hair and secure it with hairpins 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.430
 Looks like this 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.430

 and now we betray the volume of hair 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:13.019
 stretching cautious strands then hairstyle 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.019
 will look completely different 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.290

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 Spock tie it to the bank and use 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.120
