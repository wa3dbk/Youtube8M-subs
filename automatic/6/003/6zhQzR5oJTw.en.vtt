00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Halo film seekers unwelcome at film 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
 you could select last week 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 vote which remake you best 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.240
 Of course I only have those 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.990
 which are also better than that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.990
 original 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.300
 Place number seven is kay peter 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.530
 Jackson usually always comes in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.239
 connection with the lord of the rings or 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.739
 braindead but he also has king kong 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.969
 made one of the cult monsters of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.559
 Cinema history and it was clear that 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.820
 hollywood sooner or later one 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 rausbringen film is thus the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 cinema cashes ring again as well as at q 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.000
 cells 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.289
 but this is not about a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.910
 Blockbuster of money in the coffers 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 to bring one of these film made me 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.239
 also completely surprised in content jeff 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 Beck also surprised me 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.090
 therefore mostly the new comedy with 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.680
 makes and harder to prove that also in 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.270
 other genres can play peter 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 Jackson has the adventure movies on foot 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.570
 law and sets this very well and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.129
 visually as well as story-technically there are 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 here in contrast to the old movies 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 new and improved approaches a long one 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.240
 but also very entertained there and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.570
 exciting for the 8th 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 coming 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.380
 I could better search for him 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.299
 father killed 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.240
 as tom chaney and i'm looking for someone 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.649
 place number six is ​​true grit 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.049
 the kohlen brothers have joined the 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.820
 western classic with john wayne from 1969 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.439
 They have a few dared to do that 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.360
 Hollywood stars brought in the boat like 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.530
 matt damon and jeff bridges theirs 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.729
 do a very good job 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.350
 the implementation here is the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.759
 is success point for narrative 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.380
 This movie was very entertaining and much 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.450
 better than the original ones but 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.990
 Still a good movie is one 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.990
 Point 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.979
 to be happy for you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.900
 that is losing someone from the family 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.050
 has been trying for 40 years in the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 to drive madness 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.000
 place five is blinded 2009 came the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.319
 Swedish original version not out 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.849
 Once two years later, the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.590
 reinterpretation of the book publishers 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.060
 hollywood rejects the hollywood version 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.769
 thereby more to the book template and 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.819
 does not want to look like a remake 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.900
 but in the end it actually happens 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.400
 on the same with Rome 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.690
 because it works like a remake because both 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.430
 Not much of the story 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.660
 and differ from the characters 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.950
 I'm not the person was very much 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.049
 Good and I thought that this 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.200
 version because it could not come but 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.970
 you david fincher patches he is just the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.380
 king when it comes to filmmaking great 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.700
 actor and from my point of view 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.099
 this version is more exciting and better 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.579
 tells 82 points 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.680
 They determine under these questions rules 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.060
 the most disgusting collection of 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.329
 people, who you 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.310

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.909
 In this country you have to get some money first 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.390
 make it clear if you have plenty of it 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.040
 you do and when you did 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.829
 do you think each place number four 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.379
 scarface is the original came in years 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.299
 1932 out and is at the time one 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.620
 really good movie has been 50 years 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 Later, you only use china as your first 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.409
 main role of the name one of the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.510
 already a thick with the game 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.950
 name mafiafilm has made business and 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.359
 With this film he has the mafia 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.459
 secured throne he just fits 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.049
 Perfect this kind of filming and thanks 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.359
 it is this version with distance the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.359
 better version 83 points 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.959
 Pacino is this is one 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.390
 elite unit and free 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.740
 Place number three is like the parity 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.840
 For one thing, it must be said that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.760
 original from the year 2002 is for 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.530
 an asian movie a very, very good one 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.060
 Of course, find a successful movie that is 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.740
 stupid if the stupid amis again 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.420
 come and take them what is good 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.770
 and do it better like godzilla 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.270
 at the presentation it was natural 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.040
 difficult to make a better movie 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.320
 but if master director Martin 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.300
 scorsese leonardo dicaprio then snaps 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.860
 is a good movie guaranteed and this one 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.270
 here is more than just a good movie yes 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.100
 that made the original movie 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.930
 surpass by its mega custom cars 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.280
 and the brilliant implementation of the story 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 the film always stays exciting and 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.580
 Eat up to the last minute 85 points 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.500
 to say anything at all or criminals today 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.010

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.000
 where I move then 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.440
 which has not yet tried 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.510

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.110

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.970
 of course, gain and seek 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.400
 a troop of ten more 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.410
 people and they are all damned 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.590
 horny actor with this cast can 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.950
 to wrap up the original from 1960 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.950
 8.5 points 

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:13.939

 the second is considerably slower 1 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.629
 I have never had such a casino royale 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.550
 Environment a better remake seen like 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.749
 this one makes the original easy 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.639
 in the shadows and leaves that in 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.709
 forgetfulness casino is real 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.719
 modern but also classic at the same time 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:46.339
 masterful direction and acting work 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.019
 many may berate me now but 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.879
 I think this bond film for myself 

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:52.249
 one of the best, if not the best 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:54.829
