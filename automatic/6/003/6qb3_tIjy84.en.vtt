00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 and the fame of food is back in a car 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.210
 part of platinum pokémon the last of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 today where we will do at the last super four 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.030
 I know you are in the last fort 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.929
 have a great time 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 I hope and therefore not the law instead the 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.529
 volcano is always what he gave me 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.410
 more problems but with a team so well 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.539
 assorted can go back to reading yours 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.500
 books in peace arrive just in 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 time 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 I just finished reading my book 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 know the first shy ones taken in terms of me 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.239
 are Luciano use of pokémon of psycho type 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.610
 I must say that it is already a layer of being 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 exceptional, it is said that coming here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.649
 that I am the strongest of the super 4 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.329
 I think I have to prove it to be 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 up to this fame and struggling 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.320
 against how many you if I wanted to give 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 this one voted this item in Luciano 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 because you look at the shell on away from the chi 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 the borghesuccio voice is too good 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.239
 from peanuts and part with coach mime 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 stolen directly from the mother she returns 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.140
 did not stop sweeping to the ground poor 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.880
 since then I would say take advantage of it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 mister my home that so much the beginning 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.770
 will put moves as reflection and cagate ste 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.330
 here to do some curses this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.259
 will attack the attack and this will increase 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.850
 also the defense 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.009
 which we did n't need because so much 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.479
 psycho moves that will use a volcano are 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.150
 mostly special but 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.420
 will attack the attack accordingly 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.759
 we could with crunch that has 80 and is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.930
 physical being able to do more damage 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.240
 ok meanwhile obviously light screen 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.860
 increases defense increases 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.530
 the special defense of his team 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.820
 however it's okay we are in the night 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.500
 let's see how much we can do e 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 we manage to throw it, that's it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.539
 no what you don't even see red 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.560
 in the bar ok, I took care of it 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.539
 rightly there is just not seen 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.030
 not even red is well taken with a 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.030
 eye again yes 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.780
 and it does not go little by little and mentally 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.140
 or anything I just resist with ubs is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 you are forced to die 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.340
 ok out one next choice is spain 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.780
 I hope you don't send bronze right away 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 also because I am after I should change 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.290
 little is not necessarily nullifying the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.030
 damn so I hope you send everyone 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.459
 the few that are not impossible before him 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.500
 as a total from falciani hoping that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.830
 manages to miss because anyway 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 reduced speed must miss a move 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.000
 for every pokémon and that sends me at least 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:58.250
 at least it is even more 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.100
 and see ke cabbage then then let's do it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:08.150
 below of luisa total top-ups 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.190
 seigniorage era poverty there is strong no 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.830
 let's not let it go then let's change 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.120
 few women we can send to see 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.120
 to send you know 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.870
 no but when you finished yours 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:47.780
 ok out two and I said it after the drop is 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.780
 the most problematic one at home an ok 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.860
 ever faster promotion 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.650
 we want to make table fleet done because 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.830
 makes you think 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.830
 but let us try at misery 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:26.590
 I'm no b day2 perfect sparkle sorry 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.910
 on speeded bronze we can 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.910
 send written really fi 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.640
 beck campus mei but there were no more 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.220
 types of little bomb, however, where it is 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.220
 we are at fire wheel from a psycho steel 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.960
 fire beer should quietly 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.040
 spend at least fair musically 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:03.680
 rightly properly in defense 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.680
 no special fire and then physical 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:17.820
 wait, take it in that big place 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:20.970
 ong gal and hockey khaled el ultimo 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.590
 pokémon is sending us against khaled not 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.130
 I know absolutely that you would use them 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 vale cupid 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.259
 then we use we use forces 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:47.460
 however ancient in terms of statistics 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.889
 hoping it works by no, you don't have it 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.690
 made will first cut but 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.280
 from year the move for everything type 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:00.979
 burqa but that had lightning and so on 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.979
 random meaning bass 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.700
 I chose 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.350
 ok let's just go say sparkle 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.020
 by the gap there can be 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.020
 we do not know a little 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.010
 I have my boat because I knew it 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 strikes 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.800
 bad blow 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.320
 and also he defeated Luciano rockets there 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.270
 given a little trouble because I got it 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.250
 ko I say 3 pokémon but in the end nothing 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:06.190
 too outrageous to congratulate 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.110
 to all the super four anyway 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.639
 means that you've finished that 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.060
 does not mean he has finished with the 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.889
 pokémon cent life of the sample of 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.000
 notice the sample is much stronger than the 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.979
 super 4 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.320
 I've continued bank deposit you 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.060
 i take horses last fight okay 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.900
 so that this time all of us 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.280
 let's look for the next one 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.300
 we will face a camilla we will explain to 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.180
 glory we will become champions said no 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:35.530
 we hope so I know it destroyed everything 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:38.010
 See the enthusiasm we have 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.010
 tomorrow how
