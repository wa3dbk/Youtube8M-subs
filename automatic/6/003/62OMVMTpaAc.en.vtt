00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.389
 with claudio bravo claudio tie one 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 reacting in the end I do not know how you know 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.539
 point 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 not having it from the point of view already a 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.240
 little more more cold I am a good a good 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.520
 point also watching analyzing what 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 it was the match for me a positive point 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.930
 the truth that we try everywhere 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.309
 he did not give it the chance to the best of 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.190
 put ourselves in advantages then already 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 we find ourselves with a goal against and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 fortunately we could also more 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 mark and finish the game with a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.879
 point that we do not like the reaction 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 It has been very good indeed was 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.440
 very little time and the team not only 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.089
 of the goal to have some more if logical 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 before that also good at what 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.600
 it was the first two minutes of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 second time we are very strong with 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 the competition also of wanting 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.839
 mark as soon as possible the truth that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 they closed well not have many 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.690
 clear occasions and the truth that the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.270
 indie general we leave with the feeling 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.030
 positive of having tried to have 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.100
 also left with much impetus with 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 desire to look for a positive result 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.670
 but but it could not but but but 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.450
 fortunately we managed to rescue a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.829
 point 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.479
 the form follows with the good dynamics of 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.030
 league now it's up to not try to prolong the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 granada on Saturday if logical touches the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 outside a field also difficult touches 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 also to be good this point with 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 a much better result so already 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.759
 we have this week to analyze 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.259
 prepare what is coming and the truth 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 that keep showing the image 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.310
 competitive and serious team like 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.679
 carlos martÃ­nez carlos tie one today 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.490
 I do not know what evaluation of the meeting 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.649
 good result depends I have not seen everything 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.770
 the party the positive return very 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.320
 disputed 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 or with very clear occasions but 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.659
 fought 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.719
 in a delicate minute, very little is missing and 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.679
 I think we've gone up with the 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.170
 I support people 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.969
 we have managed to tie and press 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.860
 very well the game of the goal of the draw is 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.080
 central the left side so that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 right marks if the start that already 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.370
 it's last minutes and we're going up to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 see to see what happens at that moment 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.879
 He kept the beautiful and little by little 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.879
 arriving and 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.100
 I have had 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.330
 I finished off there was not much angle but 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.330
 good what's important 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 that leads a drought of many years and 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 I wanted to score a goal but good 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.530
 at that moment you see sensations that do not 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.910
 they live in other clear moments the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.470
 team and has not won but keeps adding 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.080
 now it's time not to lengthen and prolong the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.150
 league streak in Granada on Saturday and that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.220
 the important thing not to lose the equipment 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.690
 We have several days without losing that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.790
 it's important because it does not mean that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 to score we 're not going to take the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.280
 segments that was important today but 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.960
 well we saved Saturday 1 in the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.150
 last minutes I think to be 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.340
 happy with asier illarramendi yesterday 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.890
 today tie getting at the end 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 reacting well how are you 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.540
 well, I think that in the end, the point 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.790
 you have to take for good not the euro in the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.270
 first part because no team dominates 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.709
 he has not had any occasions 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.120
 clear and then in the second part 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.010
 I think we have started quite well 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680
 taking chances but good then 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.320
 think from minute 15 well the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.600
 match has been broken and good is has marked 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.160
 them already at the end and we have arrived by him 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 for the draw we have not had the luck 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.190
 to tie and for they wanted victory 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.410
 but good least tie so you know something 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.130
 best 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.040
 if not the man the goal was to win the 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:51.010
 party we have not gone for the match 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.230
 but good have started winning and good 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.689
 that question has put us uphill 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.549
 to the game but well I think that at 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.260
 end the point then you have to give 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.459
 for good since as we continue adding 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.960
 you do not have to travel to Granada on Saturday 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.490
 keep adding that is not 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.160
 I think the year we started 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.140
 pretty bad out losing four 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.660
 matches in a row but good lately 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.460
 I think we're at the best because 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.140
 less then we are also scoring and 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.180
 when we use if we also make ourselves there 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.920
 a good match and point we are going to sheen 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.340
 today arrived tie 1 what is the valuation 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.140
 what it does is the encounter of a penalty not 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.720
 it has been seen that the second part I believe 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.510
 that we have been superior and then 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.670
 Well, a great one, because they did not give it to us 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.430
 plugged in uy 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.940
 a shame because we tried to trace 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.980
 good with the tie I think you have to 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.260
 you have to stay with that because you do not 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.130
 could we adduce 20 equaled the match 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.830
 0-2 like many twists and turns and good 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.970
 you have to stay with this dot here 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.440
 to reacted very well there are five left 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.490
 minutes when the market them to 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.440
 despite all the equipment is pulled 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.910
 above and has achieved the tie if from 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.430
 the beginning I do not think we have left 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.460
 up 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.430
 and good in one of these because it has 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.100
 put a shame and then we have already 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.840
 gone up ale for the tie and the 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.900
 final because we have achieved it so 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.530
 minus nine home defeats you have to 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.530
 think of Granada 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.390
 good matches that we are scoring and that 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.390
 it is very important for us now 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.510
 with 21 points we are still up there 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.750
 and who wants to grenade please those three 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.750
 points
