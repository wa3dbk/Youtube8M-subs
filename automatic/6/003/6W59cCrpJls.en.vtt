00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.469
 Hi all, Swami Romka and today is mine 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.500
 first guide under industrial craft 2 topic 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.990
 with you we will understand how michael miner 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.390
 or I like it well we will be right 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.590
 rule from me now you are before you 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.910
 see the model 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 your normal model is not how it goes 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 we do not see resources like water or 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.469
 Well basically it's like the most on 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.879
 Now we will analyze everything in detail as 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:50.679
 you can see the war we require 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.850
 scanner and drill it in our door we 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.850
 a map like this 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:04.089
 it means we have been melted down 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.150
 iron electrons from the electrical circuit and 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.290
 batteries and we get a normal day 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.020
 I think she spends quickly so better 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.340
 make a diamond right away and we will like it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.329
 three diamonds like this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:24.450
 we enter and we get Andrei means 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.450
 here audi scan it with us 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.980
 he will look at 3 more precisely from here 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.680
 data two blocks ie two blogs in 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.540
 each side and a total of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 it turns out 16 attraction in all the way 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 It was believed scheme 3 stala rubber and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.040
 batteries and glowing here we already 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 harder u instead 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.440
 he insists and Kravts and complex vector 7 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.869
 which is done like this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.400
 microchips 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:05.810
 light growth 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:12.800
 and lapis lazuli below we will go through the battery and already 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.460
 golden cable means and here itself 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 it's done like he was very easy 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:25.730
 as far as I can see it is 2 wiring diagrams 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.000
 block machines and pipes for that is for 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 Digging iv need to do more than 10 of their 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.990
 much for how much you are 6 with a gland plan and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.940
 traffic is not going to not be very very 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.740
 will like the way you see me here 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.190
 everyone is ready and I can only 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.830
 lay the pipe there which was 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.990
 lay down here we see i 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.130
 I sent you why I came here all the time 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:58.360
 can they just now I will show how he 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:02.980
 to be painted us means here empty by the whole 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.519
 here we have pipes again 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.519
 faucet and unusual look all well and goth machines 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:15.010
 Dad needs in order for our miner not 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.319
 stopped before water or say pi 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.160
 advertising because let's say there is no 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.739
 dads will meet him then he just 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.959
 will stop 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.220
 here we need to load i empty body 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.870
 so that he portrayed and then fate 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.000
 here we are with the authorities well that is 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.560
 supplying the floor with electricity and water already 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.799
 you know look like this, we all 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.799
 happens 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.450
 no matter 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.450
 kind of electric enough 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.620
 lal 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.870
 so well, yes we have earned it I 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.790
 just stopped 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.310
 oh yeah i just didn't hit these pipes 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.320
 from the past test then more precisely their not about 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.110
 Well, here we are seeing that we are going down 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.100
 Iron ore is found in us and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.019
 mine but how do you see the three blessing then 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.380
 there is a 3 bar is obtained 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.770
 enough on 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.390
 Well, in principle, you can put not only 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.750
 and have a disk on 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.000
 and you can put something else like us and here 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.740
 she will now go down to answer he 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.740
 just chose a lab 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.649
 and for and take labor 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.310
 is ready 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.960
 Now he doesn't know the beginning 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.960
 we'll see 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.760
 continuation means something now 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.650
 let's see what we have gathered here that is 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.380
 all the resources that he collects and they 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.070
 go the courts and here we see what 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.560
 he has collected lava two words are empty 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.360
 now we have low gold ore 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.750
 Azure Railwayman 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.880
 we wash ours are broken by people who 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.060
 immediately groups that is diamonds and mostly 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.780
 will immediately immediately take so here with us 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.320
 lies 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.320
 obdii scanner 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:28.230
 and we need to kill let's take 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.230
 him from the cameras and shift 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.520
 so for but he obviously will not go therefore i 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.849
 I'll just move it now 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.849
 So 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.090
 remove thing is not Well, in general it was possible to 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.120
 simply 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.740
 as if everything is correct and how we 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.340
 we see now he should in theory 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.580
 more pick more 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.199
 news about the witch if he collects glands 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.120
 yeah, and we can do it now 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.350
 much higher scores and 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.180
 actions that is to here not 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.410
 delivered right now to this unit 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:10.669
 must get it yes we see that he went 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.669
 need to develop a song 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.560
 pleased now I took a long time for such 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.200
 will find that way you principle 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.590
 it will be enough to put it once 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.510
 run and here we see that how would 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.940
 few resources 3 so much because and 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.160
 depth is such a depth in the ordinary world 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.200
 It will be much more and therefore will take and 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.150
 on naturally much more here we are 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.150
 see again sony got diamonds 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.540
 Well , in principle, and everything was with you romka 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.040
 put likes subscribe to the channel 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.900
 leave your comments or 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.040
 I am happy to ask your questions 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.750
 try not to want 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.750
 if everything works out for me
