00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
okay i'm looking at their article and
this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> exactly<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.450> say<00:00:42.600> quality<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this is exactly what they say quality is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
this is exactly what they say quality is
their<00:00:43.350> number<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.649> priority<00:00:43.770> number<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:44.789> we

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
their number one priority number one we

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
their number one priority number one we
know<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.629> true<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> was

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
in the first place they would have

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
in the first place they would have
waited<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.460> while<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.820> actually<00:00:50.940> release<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

that means it could be anything from a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.859 
that means it could be anything from a
couple<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.390> hours<00:01:57.780> from<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.700> month<00:02:00.659> or

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
or two at most but I really don't see it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.490 
or two at most but I really don't see it
being<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.070> long<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.930> rather<00:02:21.930> than<00:02:22.140> fix

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
being that long I rather than fix

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
being that long I rather than fix
everything<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.760> release<00:02:24.030> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
everything with it then just release it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.790 
everything with it then just release it
and<00:02:24.570> another<00:02:25.050> thing<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> they're<00:02:25.530> saying

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and another thing is they're saying

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.860 
and another thing is they're saying
they're<00:02:25.980> going<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.190> release<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
they're going to release it to all the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.870 
they're going to release it to all the
players<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.770> their<00:02:29.130> official<00:02:29.280> channels<00:02:29.820> I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
players on their official channels I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.730 
players on their official channels I
don't<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.390> means<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:31.140> precisely

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
don't know what that means it precisely

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.320 
don't know what that means it precisely
does<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.190> mean<00:02:32.340> they're<00:02:32.490> their<00:02:32.970> YouTube

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
does that mean they're their YouTube

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.670 
does that mean they're their YouTube
channel<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.870> they're<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.230> their<00:02:34.380> twitter

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
channel and they're in their twitter

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
channel and they're in their twitter
page<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.610> Twitter<00:02:35.880> page<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.150> not<00:02:36.240> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
page because the Twitter page is not a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.050 
page because the Twitter page is not a
channel<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:38.250> whatever<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:38.790> channel

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
channel so I'm whatever I think channel

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.520 
channel so I'm whatever I think channel
i<00:02:39.120> hear<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.510> tube<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.960> back<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.260> my<00:02:40.290> head

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
i hear you tube in the back of my head

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.320 
i hear you tube in the back of my head
so<00:02:40.740> I'm<00:02:40.860> guessing<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.460> means<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.210> they

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
so I'm guessing that means that they

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.700 
so I'm guessing that means that they
have<00:02:42.360> other<00:02:42.720> channels<00:02:43.290> other<00:02:43.470> than

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
have other channels other than

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.800 
have other channels other than
battlefield<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> way<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
battlefield like that's just the way I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.840 
battlefield like that's just the way I
see<00:02:46.200> maybe<00:02:46.470> that's<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.740> EA<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.340> battlefield

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
see maybe that's like EA in battlefield

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.060 
see maybe that's like EA in battlefield
I<00:02:48.030> don't<00:02:48.210> know<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.230> got<00:02:49.470> confused<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.040> that
