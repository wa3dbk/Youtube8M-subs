replace<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.359> nozzle<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.439> probably<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
replace the nozzle here probably not the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.940 
replace the nozzle here probably not the
best<00:00:29.820> situation<00:00:31.250> more<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> paint<00:00:32.759> shop

mine<00:00:41.550> running<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.969> 45<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.840> didn't<00:00:43.079> seem<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
mine running at 45 it didn't seem to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440 
mine running at 45 it didn't seem to
really<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> run<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.640> well<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:45.090> anything

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450

really want to run very well on anything
below<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.120> I've<00:00:48.180> got<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
below that so that's what I've got it

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.680 
below that so that's what I've got it
set<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:49.219> we'll<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.370> ahead<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
set at right now we'll go ahead and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
set at right now we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:00:51.690> let<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> dry<00:00:52.670> put<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.149> four

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we'll let this dry put three or four

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.689 
we'll let this dry put three or four
coats<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.870> color<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.309> we'll<00:00:56.489> start

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
coats of color on it then we'll start

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
coats of color on it then we'll start
with<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.030> clear<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.690> hopefully<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.710> will

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
with some clear so hopefully this will

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
with some clear so hopefully this will
turn<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.070> well<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> though<00:01:00.329> we'll<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.629> from

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
turn out well and though we'll go from

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
turn out well and though we'll go from
there<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.170> stay<00:01:01.680> tuned<00:01:01.920> okay<00:01:02.329> we've<00:01:03.329> got<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there so stay tuned okay we've got the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.410 
there so stay tuned okay we've got the
second<00:01:03.870> coat<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.580> some<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.760> tips<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.150> tricks

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
second coat on some more tips and tricks

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
second coat on some more tips and tricks
that<00:01:06.600> I've<00:01:06.720> read<00:01:06.960> online<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.430> paint

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that I've read online is with this paint

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
that I've read online is with this paint
you<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> hold<00:01:09.119> 7/8<00:01:09.659> inches<00:01:10.049> away<00:01:10.229> from

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you want to hold 7/8 inches away from

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
you want to hold 7/8 inches away from
the<00:01:10.650> panel<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.369> painting<00:01:12.619> also<00:01:13.850> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the panel that you're painting also this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.350 
the panel that you're painting also this
panel<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.390> probably<00:01:15.869> require<00:01:16.100> normally<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
panel would probably require normally a

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
panel would probably require normally a
wet<00:01:18.360> sanding<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> between<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.409> clear<00:01:19.590> coat

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
wet sanding in between the clear coat

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
wet sanding in between the clear coat
I'm<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.270> going

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I'm not going to do that I'm just going

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.499 
I'm not going to do that I'm just going
to<00:01:21.509> straight<00:01:21.780> clear<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to straight clear it but it if there is

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.890 
to straight clear it but it if there is
mortgage<00:01:24.900> people<00:01:25.110> already<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.970> definitely

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
mortgage people already so definitely

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
mortgage people already so definitely
would<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.850> wet<00:01:29.850> sanding<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.360> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
would want to do a wet sanding but this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
would want to do a wet sanding but this
is<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> trial<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
is just a trial we want to see how the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.940 
is just a trial we want to see how the
red<00:01:32.520> looks<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.600> from

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
red looks and then go from

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.459 
red looks and then go from
so<00:01:34.420> again<00:01:35.420> that's<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.659> second<00:01:36.079> code<00:01:36.229> I'll

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
so again that's the second code I'll

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.560 
so again that's the second code I'll
probably<00:01:36.649> do<00:01:36.799> two<00:01:36.979> more<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:37.579> keep<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.329> watching

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
probably do two more so keep on watching

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.529 
probably do two more so keep on watching
stay<00:01:39.020> tuned<00:01:39.579> okay<00:01:40.579> we've<00:01:40.789> got<00:01:40.939> our<00:01:41.030> final<00:01:41.270> base

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
stay tuned okay we've got our final base

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.719 
stay tuned okay we've got our final base
coat<00:01:41.780> down<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.710> actually<00:01:43.189> does<00:01:43.340> not<00:01:43.520> look<00:01:43.700> that

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
coat down it actually does not look that

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.440 
coat down it actually does not look that
bad<00:01:45.700> there<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:46.939> right<00:01:47.119> there

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
bad there it is right there

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.270 
bad there it is right there
again<00:01:48.049> there's<00:01:48.229> dents<00:01:48.469> in<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.159> just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
again there's dents in this this is just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.859 
again there's dents in this this is just
a<00:01:49.429> practice<00:01:49.820> panel<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.939> see<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.119> there<00:01:53.390> we're

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
a practice panel so see that there we're

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.120 
a practice panel so see that there we're
going<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.110> let<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.229> continue<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.860> dry<00:01:55.069> for

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
going to let that continue to dry for

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.440 
going to let that continue to dry for
about<00:01:55.429> another<00:01:55.490> five<00:01:55.850> minutes<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.270> then

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
about another five minutes and then

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.359 
about another five minutes and then
