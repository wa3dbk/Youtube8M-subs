00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980 
and I think he's it was at the time
where<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.790> change<00:02:03.180> color

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
where these would change color

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.880 
where these would change color
I'm<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.189> though<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
I'm not sure though I think they do I

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
I'm not sure though I think they do I
got<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.009> frog<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.149> one

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
got this frog and I think this one

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.660 
got this frog and I think this one
changes<00:02:09.690> its<00:02:09.899> colors<00:02:10.319> because<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
changes its colors because I think this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.920 
changes its colors because I think this
used<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.120> blue<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.660> it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
used to be blue now it's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.300 
used to be blue now it's
purple<00:02:14.209> by<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.239> way<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:15.659> has<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> pool<00:02:16.439> as<00:02:16.590> well

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.580 

so<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.609> got<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.909> lizard<00:02:23.480> cute<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.409> I'm

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so then I got this lizard cute and I'm

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.339 
so then I got this lizard cute and I'm
