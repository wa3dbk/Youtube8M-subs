00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the only con that I really have is just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.150 
the only con that I really have is just
that<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> doesn't<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.000> any<00:02:09.209> type<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:10.160> bonding

that it doesn't have any type of bonding
a<00:02:11.280> ribbon<00:02:11.520> keep<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.849> close<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> slight

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
a ribbon keep it close or is a slight

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.440 
a ribbon keep it close or is a slight
magnet<00:02:13.200> there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
magnet there

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.240

but<00:02:13.870> overall<00:02:14.170> that's<00:02:14.560> not<00:02:14.739> an<00:02:14.830> issue<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.069> me

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
but overall that's not an issue for me

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.589 
but overall that's not an issue for me
or<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> deal-breaker<00:02:15.730> at<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.209> think<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
or a deal-breaker at all I think it

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.080 
or a deal-breaker at all I think it
keeps<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.050> case<00:02:17.349> down<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.160> very<00:02:18.489> nice<00:02:18.730> look
