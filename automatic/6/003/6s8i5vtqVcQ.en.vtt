00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
between these two card types and I could

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
between these two card types and I could
probably<00:02:27.770> do<00:02:27.950> another<00:02:28.070> video<00:02:28.400> about<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.880> in

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
probably do another video about this in

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.880 
probably do another video about this in
a<00:02:29.060> lot<00:02:29.209> more<00:02:29.239> depth<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.770> kind

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
a lot more depth but this is just a kind

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.030 
a lot more depth but this is just a kind
of<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.070> quick<00:02:31.190> question<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.380> first<00:02:33.620> step<00:02:33.890> in

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
of a quick question so the first step in

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.560 
of a quick question so the first step in
really<00:02:34.280> learning<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.610> concept<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
really learning this concept is to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.900 
really learning this concept is to
practice<00:02:36.170> interchanging<00:02:37.100> these<00:02:37.220> two<00:02:37.459> chords

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
practice interchanging these two chords

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970 
practice interchanging these two chords
so<00:02:38.510> I'll<00:02:38.630> probably<00:02:38.780> put<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:39.380> an<00:02:39.799> air

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so I'll probably put on like an air

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.250 
so I'll probably put on like an air
minus<00:02:40.310> seventh<00:02:40.580> backing<00:02:40.940> track<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:42.170> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
minus seventh backing track and then I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.910 
minus seventh backing track and then I
start<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.680> use<00:02:44.200> inversions<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.380> d7<00:02:45.769> chord

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
start to use inversions of a d7 chord

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.759 
start to use inversions of a d7 chord
and<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:47.209> could<00:02:47.360> do<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> same<00:02:47.720> thing<00:02:48.019> put<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.290> d7

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
and you could do the same thing put a d7

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.650 
and you could do the same thing put a d7
backing<00:02:49.130> track<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.000> then<00:02:50.150> use<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:52.660> minor

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
backing track on and then use a minor

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.060 
backing track on and then use a minor
seventh<00:02:54.019> inversions<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.739> that'll<00:02:54.920> really

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
seventh inversions and that'll really

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.190 
seventh inversions and that'll really
start<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.700> help<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.030> connect<00:02:56.360> these<00:02:56.959> two

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
start to help you connect these two

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.229 
start to help you connect these two
costs<00:02:57.590> together<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.610> lost<00:02:58.790> about<00:02:59.000> twice

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
costs together and you lost about twice

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.449 
costs together and you lost about twice
as<00:02:59.420> many<00:02:59.510> inversions<00:02:59.959> if<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.130> about<00:03:01.250> if

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
as many inversions if you think about if

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.699 
as many inversions if you think about if
you<00:03:01.549> are<00:03:01.640> playing<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.910> Blues<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.390> b-flat<00:03:02.930> you

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
you are playing the Blues in b-flat you

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.990 
you are playing the Blues in b-flat you
can<00:03:03.890> use<00:03:04.040> all<00:03:04.250> your<00:03:04.280> regular<00:03:04.489> dominant

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
can use all your regular dominant

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.490 
can use all your regular dominant
seventh<00:03:05.360> sounds<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.130> also<00:03:07.280> use<00:03:08.500> some

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
seventh sounds and you can also use some

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.050 
seventh sounds and you can also use some
of<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.709> have<00:03:09.890> -<00:03:10.310> sounds<00:03:10.549> as<00:03:10.670> well<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:10.970> it's

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
of you have - sounds as well so it's

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.520 
of you have - sounds as well so it's
going<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.209> give<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.480> twice<00:03:11.660> as<00:03:11.870> much<00:03:11.959> cards

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
going to give you twice as much cards

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.600 
going to give you twice as much cards
and<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.769> going<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.950> give<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.130> twice<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.579> much

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
and it's going to give you twice as much

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.520 
and it's going to give you twice as much
lines<00:03:14.060> as<00:03:14.299> well<00:03:14.450> cuz<00:03:14.630> all<00:03:14.750> your<00:03:14.900> lines<00:03:15.049> over

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
lines as well cuz all your lines over

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.470 
lines as well cuz all your lines over
the<00:03:16.130> minor<00:03:16.370> seventh<00:03:16.790> chord<00:03:16.820> will<00:03:17.150> work<00:03:17.299> with

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
the minor seventh chord will work with

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.569 
the minor seventh chord will work with
the<00:03:17.540> dominant<00:03:17.959> seventh<00:03:18.200> chord<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.310> that's<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
the dominant seventh chord so that's the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.610 
the dominant seventh chord so that's the
first<00:03:19.820> part<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.299> video<00:03:20.570> now<00:03:21.200> we<00:03:21.260> go<00:03:21.470> into

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
first part to the video now we go into

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.430 
first part to the video now we go into
the<00:03:21.769> extensions<00:03:22.340> melodic<00:03:23.060> minor<00:03:23.329> and<00:03:23.720> Lydian

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
the extensions melodic minor and Lydian

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.740 
the extensions melodic minor and Lydian
dominant<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.820> melodic<00:03:26.420> minor

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
dominant so a melodic minor

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.030 
dominant so a melodic minor
let's<00:03:26.989> just<00:03:27.079> play<00:03:27.260> back<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> fifth<00:03:27.860> fret

11<00:04:55.180> I'll<00:04:56.180> just<00:04:56.419> think<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.900> name<00:04:57.080> logic

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
11 I'll just think of the name logic

11 I'll just think of the name logic
minor<00:04:57.650> instantly<00:04:58.220> now<00:04:58.430> I'll<00:04:58.700> just<00:04:58.760> use<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.300> I

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
minor instantly now I'll just use that I

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.610 
minor instantly now I'll just use that I
won't<00:04:59.600> really<00:04:59.810> actually<00:04:59.930> think<00:05:00.230> Lydian

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
won't really actually think Lydian

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.700 
won't really actually think Lydian
dominant<00:05:01.040> but<00:05:01.280> all<00:05:01.400> basically<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.990> that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
dominant but all basically so that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.080 
dominant but all basically so that
worked<00:05:03.950> for<00:05:04.070> me<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.220> mean<00:05:04.460> you<00:05:04.700> know<00:05:04.820> it's

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
worked for me I mean you know it's

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.640 
worked for me I mean you know it's
probably<00:05:05.240> worth<00:05:05.510> practicing<00:05:05.750> reading<00:05:06.260> double

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
probably worth practicing reading double

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.830 
probably worth practicing reading double
in<00:05:06.710> his<00:05:06.740> own<00:05:07.040> right<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.640> you<00:05:08.300> know<00:05:08.419> I'm<00:05:08.510> kinda

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
in his own right but you know I'm kinda

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.480 
in his own right but you know I'm kinda
lazy<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.350> both<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.650> these<00:05:09.740> have<00:05:09.919> exactly<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
lazy and both of these have exactly the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.540 
lazy and both of these have exactly the
same<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:12.560> I'll<00:05:12.860> just<00:05:12.890> kind<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.280> think<00:05:13.460> of

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
same and so I'll just kind of think of

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.450 
same and so I'll just kind of think of
one<00:05:13.669> thing<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.630> really<00:05:15.230> recommend

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
one thing that I really recommend

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.030 
one thing that I really recommend
getting<00:05:16.460> fast<00:05:17.390> with<00:05:17.800> interchanging<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.890> 2

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
getting fast with interchanging the 2

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.340 
getting fast with interchanging the 2
and<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.190> 5<00:05:19.370> cards<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.360> what<00:05:20.480> I'd<00:05:20.600> do<00:05:20.750> if<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.200> were

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
and the 5 cards so what I'd do if I were

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.440 
and the 5 cards so what I'd do if I were
you<00:05:21.380> is<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.800> would<00:05:21.980> get<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.820> tune<00:05:23.090> initially

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
you is I would get a tune initially
