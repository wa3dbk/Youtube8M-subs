um<00:01:43.149> one<00:01:44.109> two<00:01:45.009> one<00:01:46.000> three

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
um one two one three

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.030 
um one two one three
one<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:49.950> kick<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.990> one<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.940> one<00:01:53.940> three<00:01:54.390> two

one two kick on one two one three two

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.150 
one two kick on one two one three two
one<00:01:56.750> two<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.050> trick<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
one two the trick here is just to do it

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.610 
one two the trick here is just to do it
over<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> over<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.910> over<00:02:00.090> again<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
over and over and over again so it

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.960 
over and over and over again so it
becomes<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.220> bit<00:02:02.340> automated<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
becomes a little bit automated so you

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.640 
becomes a little bit automated so you
think<00:02:06.180> about<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.720> some<00:02:06.960> point<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.530> near

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
think about it at some point in the near

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.469 
think about it at some point in the near
future<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.760> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> start<00:02:09.240> changing

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
future you're going to start changing

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.560 
future you're going to start changing
chords<00:02:10.080> while<00:02:10.290> you're<00:02:10.440> doing<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
chords while you're doing this so the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.780 
chords while you're doing this so the
big<00:02:12.870> trick<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.860> keep<00:02:14.070> doing<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.490> over

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
big trick is just to keep doing it over

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.460 
big trick is just to keep doing it over
and<00:02:15.270> over<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> over<00:02:15.870> again

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.540 

once<00:02:21.470> you've<00:02:21.620> got<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.920> pattern<00:02:22.130> kind<00:02:22.400> of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
once you've got the pattern kind of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.520 
once you've got the pattern kind of
under<00:02:22.790> your<00:02:22.880> fingers<00:02:23.210> good<00:02:23.660> idea<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.140> try

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
under your fingers good idea to just try

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.900 
under your fingers good idea to just try
and<00:02:24.560> speed<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.070> up<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.340> little<00:02:25.370> bit<00:02:25.640> maybe

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
and speed it up a little bit maybe

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.800 
and speed it up a little bit maybe
getting<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.330> up<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> speed<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.200> like

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.490 

one<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.440> two<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.220> three<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.090> four<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.020> thumb

now<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.520> those<00:02:42.610> with<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> G<00:02:43.150> chord<00:02:43.360> with

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
now all of those with the G chord with

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720 
now all of those with the G chord with
the<00:02:43.870> thumb<00:02:44.230> playing<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.950> bass<00:02:45.130> note<00:02:45.400> there

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the thumb playing the bass note there

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.610 
the thumb playing the bass note there
which<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.390> sixth<00:02:46.720> string<00:02:46.780> now<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
which is on the sixth string now a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.500 
which is on the sixth string now a
really<00:02:47.920> nice<00:02:48.280> little<00:02:48.580> sequence<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> practice

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
really nice little sequence to practice

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.240 
really nice little sequence to practice
is<00:02:49.660> G<00:02:50.730> D<00:02:52.710> C<00:02:54.300> D<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.770> really<00:02:57.010> good<00:02:57.100> one

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
is G D C D this is a really good one

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.800 
is G D C D this is a really good one
aside<00:02:58.150> from<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> fact<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.750> actually

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
aside from the fact that it actually

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.480 
aside from the fact that it actually
sounds<00:02:59.320> kind<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> nice<00:02:59.680> means<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.370> your

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
sounds kind of nice means that your

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.190 
sounds kind of nice means that your
thumbs<00:03:00.730> moving<00:03:01.120> from<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.420> sixth<00:03:01.750> string<00:03:01.960> for

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
thumbs moving from the sixth string for

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.830 
thumbs moving from the sixth string for
the<00:03:02.290> G<00:03:02.500> over<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.460> fourth<00:03:03.790> string<00:03:03.880> for<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the G over to the fourth string for the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.410 
the G over to the fourth string for the
D<00:03:05.020> chord<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.890> fifth<00:03:06.250> string<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.210> C

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
D chord to the fifth string for the C

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.480 
D chord to the fifth string for the C
chord<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.870> back<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.650> fourth<00:03:08.920> string<00:03:09.220> for

chord and back to the fourth string for

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.190 
chord and back to the fourth string for
the<00:03:09.550> D<00:03:09.730> chord<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.960> thumbs

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the D chord so you really your thumbs

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.020 
the D chord so you really your thumbs
have<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.740> bit<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.070> workout<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.880> what

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
have to get a bit of a workout and what

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.400 
have to get a bit of a workout and what
you<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.630> probably<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.110> play<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
you do is to probably just play that

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.470 
you do is to probably just play that
pattern<00:03:14.800> once<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.310> each<00:03:15.580> chord<00:03:15.910> something

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
pattern once on each chord something

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.410 
pattern once on each chord something
like<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.110> G

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.670

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.129 
very nice little sequence again so you
can<00:04:40.340> apply<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:40.639> lots<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.449> different<00:04:41.780> ways<00:04:41.960> of

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
can apply this lots of different ways of

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.200 
can apply this lots of different ways of
course<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.800> might<00:04:42.949> do<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.220> say<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.580> an<00:04:43.729> E<00:04:44.000> minor

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
course you might do it say on an E minor

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.340 
course you might do it say on an E minor
so<00:04:44.840> thumb<00:04:45.590> would<00:04:45.680> be<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.039> 6th<00:04:46.400> string<00:04:46.990> 1<00:04:47.990> 2

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
so thumb would be on the 6th string 1 2

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.400 
so thumb would be on the 6th string 1 2
3<00:04:48.979> 2<00:04:49.490> 2<00:04:49.840> 3

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:03.890 

and<00:04:55.680> maybe<00:04:55.920> toss<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.370> code<00:04:57.890> three

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.390 

three-fifty<00:05:04.900> cord

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.930 

D<00:05:11.970> minor

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.860 

see

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.620 

most<00:05:21.440> remember<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:21.920> see<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.000> thumb<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.450> now

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
most remember you see the thumb is now

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.670 
most remember you see the thumb is now
on<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.900> fifth<00:05:24.140> string<00:05:24.290> the<00:05:26.320> thumb<00:05:27.320> is<00:05:27.440> on<00:05:27.530> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
on the fifth string the thumb is on the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.850 
on the fifth string the thumb is on the
fourth<00:05:27.920> string

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.409 

so<00:05:34.860> that's<00:05:35.039> also<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.819> really<00:05:36.240> nice

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
so that's also a really really nice

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.420 
so that's also a really really nice
little<00:05:36.599> sequence<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.650> last<00:05:37.949> one<00:05:38.129> I<00:05:38.160> want<00:05:38.370> to

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
little sequence the last one I want to

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.159 
little sequence the last one I want to
explain<00:05:38.759> to<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.030> here<00:05:39.240> is<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.629> we<00:05:39.870> kind<00:05:39.990> of

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
explain to you here is that we kind of

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.960 
explain to you here is that we kind of
looked<00:05:40.289> at<00:05:40.379> it<00:05:40.500> last<00:05:40.710> time<00:05:40.949> but<00:05:41.159> this<00:05:41.550> one<00:05:41.789> I

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
looked at it last time but this one I

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.760 
looked at it last time but this one I
want<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.479> describe<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.229> as<00:05:43.379> being<00:05:43.620> in

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
want to describe it to you as being in

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.950 
want to describe it to you as being in
six<00:05:44.129> now<00:05:44.909> you<00:05:44.970> could<00:05:45.240> think<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.509> it<00:05:45.599> as<00:05:45.690> kind<00:05:45.840> of

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
six now you could think of it as kind of

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.600 
six now you could think of it as kind of
two<00:05:46.169> triplets<00:05:46.680> but<00:05:46.830> really<00:05:47.129> what<00:05:47.280> we're<00:05:47.430> going

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
two triplets but really what we're going

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.869 
two triplets but really what we're going
for<00:05:47.699> here<00:05:47.879> is<00:05:48.180> one<00:05:48.750> two<00:05:49.139> three<00:05:49.620> four<00:05:50.039> five<00:05:50.490> six

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
for here is one two three four five six

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.820 
for here is one two three four five six
so<00:05:51.479> if<00:05:51.539> we<00:05:51.629> just<00:05:51.810> do<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:51.960> on<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.169> D<00:05:52.409> chord<00:05:52.680> we're

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
so if we just do it on the D chord we're

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.059 
so if we just do it on the D chord we're
just<00:05:52.949> going<00:05:53.159> up<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.639> down<00:05:53.759> so<00:05:54.030> go<00:05:54.180> thumb<00:05:54.810> 1<00:05:55.229> 2<00:05:55.650> 3

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
just going up and down so go thumb 1 2 3

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:04.309 
just going up and down so go thumb 1 2 3
2<00:05:56.520> 1<00:05:57.000> 1<00:05:57.930> 2<00:05:58.379> 3<00:05:58.680> 2<00:05:59.310> 1<00:05:59.729> like<00:05:59.909> 1<00:06:00.240> 2<00:06:00.720> 3<00:06:00.750> 4<00:06:01.620> 5<00:06:02.009> 6<00:06:02.460> 2<00:06:03.389> 3<00:06:03.870> 4

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.770 

it's<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.430> very<00:06:19.669> nice<00:06:19.850> little<00:06:20.090> sequence<00:06:20.630> this

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
it's a very nice little sequence this

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.200 
it's a very nice little sequence this
one<00:06:21.020> and<00:06:21.470> you<00:06:21.560> can<00:06:21.590> work<00:06:22.160> it<00:06:22.340> through<00:06:22.699> lots<00:06:23.060> of

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
one and you can work it through lots of

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.030 
one and you can work it through lots of
different<00:06:23.270> cause<00:06:23.750> now<00:06:24.410> we've<00:06:24.530> just<00:06:24.710> gone<00:06:24.860> to

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
different cause now we've just gone to

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.090 
different cause now we've just gone to
an<00:06:25.160> email<00:06:25.400> maybe<00:06:26.150> go<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.419> an<00:06:26.570> a<00:06:26.800> and<00:06:27.800> now<00:06:27.949> we've

an email maybe go to an a and now we've

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.129 
an email maybe go to an a and now we've
got<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.370> fifth<00:06:28.610> string<00:06:28.910> room

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
got the fifth string room

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.270 
got the fifth string room

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
you go back to E minor even we can even

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.100 
you go back to E minor even we can even
go<00:06:35.550> lady<00:06:35.940> something<00:06:36.330> radical

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
go lady something radical

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.330 
go lady something radical
we've<00:06:37.710> just<00:06:37.889> got<00:06:38.099> to<00:06:38.129> see

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
we've just got to see

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.119 
we've just got to see
with<00:06:39.820> the<00:06:39.940> thumb

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
with the thumb

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.100 
with the thumb
moving<00:06:41.279> over<00:06:41.369> to<00:06:41.550> the<00:06:41.699> fifth<00:06:42.029> string<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.599> B

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
moving over to the fifth string the B

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.779 
moving over to the fifth string the B
key<00:06:43.349> here<00:06:43.679> is<00:06:43.889> making<00:06:44.339> sure<00:06:44.489> that<00:06:44.520> your<00:06:44.759> thumb

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
key here is making sure that your thumb

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.449 
key here is making sure that your thumb
knows<00:06:45.330> which<00:06:45.779> the<00:06:46.289> bass<00:06:46.469> note<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:47.009> for<00:06:47.249> each<00:06:47.429> of

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:47.459 
knows which the bass note is for each of

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:48.949 
knows which the bass note is for each of
the<00:06:47.699> chords<00:06:48.029> so<00:06:48.149> it<00:06:48.270> knows<00:06:48.419> whether<00:06:48.629> to<00:06:48.779> pluck

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
the chords so it knows whether to pluck

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.320 
the chords so it knows whether to pluck
the<00:06:49.110> sixth<00:06:49.409> string<00:06:49.589> the<00:06:49.979> fifth<00:06:50.219> string<00:06:50.489> or<00:06:50.849> the

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
the sixth string the fifth string or the

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.629 
the sixth string the fifth string or the
fourth<00:06:51.569> string<00:06:51.839> so<00:06:52.559> having<00:06:53.069> play<00:06:53.279> around<00:06:53.489> with

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
fourth string so having play around with

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.889 
fourth string so having play around with
those<00:06:53.759> three<00:06:54.089> patterns<00:06:54.449> see<00:06:54.599> if<00:06:54.689> you<00:06:54.749> can

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:54.899 
those three patterns see if you can

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:56.149 
those three patterns see if you can
apply<00:06:55.139> them<00:06:55.379> to<00:06:55.409> some<00:06:55.709> songs

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
apply them to some songs

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.129 
apply them to some songs
there's<00:06:56.909> lists<00:06:57.269> of<00:06:57.360> songs<00:06:57.509> that<00:06:57.689> use<00:06:57.899> them<00:06:58.050> on

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
there's lists of songs that use them on

there's lists of songs that use them on
the<00:06:58.229> website<00:06:58.619> but<00:06:59.009> just<00:06:59.249> use<00:06:59.550> your<00:06:59.729> ears<00:06:59.909> as
