00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 hi this is raddho here is the video of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.050
 updates for the cac 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 as well as for archos that's where we in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.969
 are today 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.670
 the session is rather engaging so this 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.680
 is not so much the rose of 0.37 percent 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.870
 which is not really 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.829
 significant that the challenges that have been 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.890
 records and 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.070
 today especially watch well we 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.469
 has come bouncing back preserving the 23 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.820
 26% fibonacci retracement of which I 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.370
 spoke yesterday and the moving average to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.589
 this session explain us yesterday against 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.449
 the lows of November 16 and the most 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.659
 of November 23 had no concern had 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.939
 increased anyway not bad and was 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.189
 normal to consolidate and that's on the 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.679
 level of the 23 26% so so very 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.149
 classic we bounced back then the 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.280
 technical indicators of the coup do not have 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.229
 had time to degrade one with this 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.060
 little consolidation that's since 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.280
 four days since the stochastic 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.049
 that we can see here remains 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.100
 clearly in his over-buying area at 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.619
 above his signal at the same time the m 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.140
 yielded and above his signal and he 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.569
 is positive that's fine and the moment 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.159
 tom is also positive so that 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.539
 eventually it without having attended 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.000
 basically a consolidation 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.500
 fairly healthy conciliation and any 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.909
 way as it will stay above the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.009
 moving average at 20 sessions there is 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.590
 no reason to imagine that we will not do 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.269
 not the highest at one time 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.250
 besides that it should happen 

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.440
 shortly when we go to get the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 top of the brown channel 1 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.650
 to 3500 36 after it will have to pass 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.210
 broken up that brown channel which 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.100
 will not be easy to do but 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.910
 I still expect a test of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.980
 top of the brown channel very very soon 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.500
 that's now something promised thing due 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.560
 a little video a little analysis 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.840
 archos technique and so here is the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.490
 video to see how we can see it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.770
 on this video on this graph the courses 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.320
 have the price that a scheme is enough 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.670
 classic 1 we must have passed 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.770
 the moving average at 20 sessions 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.440
 here it was November 21st we did a 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.810
 little pullback and we exploded at the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.070
 up and what happened today 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.050
 also eliminating the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.270
 black channel the channel theory says that 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.460
 in his own juice situation the goal is 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.010
 determined by the postponement of the thickness 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.840
 the channel from the break point 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.420
 in other words here is the thickness of the channel 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 it is reported here which brings us to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.330
 wait for contact with this oblique 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.739
 6-1 so around 4 45 then the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.220
 technical indicators are fine 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.050
 oriented 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.120
 since we are on the stochastic 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.010
 above the signal for the masses and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 we are above the signal too and 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.300
 for the amount is positive plus we 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.920
 allows himself to do a t1 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.050
 that is to say a fence above the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.760
 upper bollinger and this fence 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.930
 is of good quality since it is 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.130
 in a context where bollinger 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.060
 superior lower bollinger 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 divergent 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.800
 so that's a good thing that wants 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.140
 say that there is an increase in your 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.580
 volatility and that things are in 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.220
 room for tomorrow we are 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.170
 possibly a t2 that is to say a one 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.150
 second fence above the good 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.920
 top pulpit and I will tell you 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.209
 I finished with that it would be better 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 because actually look good 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.530
 we have just entered a triple 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.440
 hidden divergence on the stock 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.060
 on the m to cd and on the moment tom on 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.989
 makes the highest while at the same time 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.489
 time on the courts 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.930
 we did not do higher like you 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.820
 can see it's called a 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.769
 bearish divergence hide it's very 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.540
 very very very very dangerous it takes 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.550
 imperatively to keep this 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.320
 perspective make higher 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.310
 also on the same course 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.269
 that we made them on the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.640
 indicators which means 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.580
 concretely to help him not ceded 3,78 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.620
 if we do not pass the 3 78 and we 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.390
 begins to falter in this case the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.459
 situation is likely to be really 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.290
 really very worrying for archos 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.060
 who may dive even harder 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.920
 that he did not increase so to do 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 simple one is very well oriented on 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.169
 archos we recover from a sense of 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.450
 walk but it is imperative 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.220
 pass this level of 3 77 318 for 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.370
 evacuate this sword of damocles otherwise 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.070
 it may be 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.690
 very delicate here you wish a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.650
