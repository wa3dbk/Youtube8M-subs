thousand milliamp power

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.660 
thousand milliamp power
oh<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.699> says<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:55.550> looking<00:00:56.550> at

gorilla one we had which is about three

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
gorilla one we had which is about three
times<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> size<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.589> outputs<00:01:04.830> one

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
times the size it has two outputs one

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
times the size it has two outputs one
amp<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.229> 2.1<00:01:07.229> amp<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:10.430> micro<00:01:11.430> SD<00:01:11.820> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
amp and 2.1 amp out and one micro SD in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
amp and 2.1 amp out and one micro SD in
there<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.170> unless<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.619> little

there don't you see that unless a little

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.260 
there don't you see that unless a little
LED<00:01:14.450> indicator<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.950> rather<00:01:17.790> simple<00:01:18.090> as

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
LED indicator so it's rather simple as

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.460 
LED indicator so it's rather simple as
you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.509> no<00:01:18.659> buttons<00:01:18.990> no<00:01:19.080> switches<00:01:19.439> just

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you can get no buttons no switches just

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
you can get no buttons no switches just
some<00:01:19.799> LEDs<00:01:20.159> which<00:01:20.430> light<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.090> hold

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
some LEDs which light up when you hold

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
some LEDs which light up when you hold
it<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.600> Sun<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.610> obviously<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it up the Sun like that obviously if it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
it up the Sun like that obviously if it
is<00:01:23.939> twenty<00:01:24.360> thousand<00:01:24.930> milliamp<00:01:25.200> power<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is twenty thousand milliamp power and I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
is twenty thousand milliamp power and I
have<00:01:26.759> no<00:01:26.970> reason<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> call<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.780> liar

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
have no reason to call them liar

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.230 
have no reason to call them liar
then<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.700> keep<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.240> phone<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:31.020> for
