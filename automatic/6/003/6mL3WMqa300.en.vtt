00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.459 
going to look at the link in the key of
a<00:00:11.700> minor<00:00:12.150> which<00:00:12.630> involves<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> few<00:00:13.349> more

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a minor which involves a few more

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.930 
a minor which involves a few more
interesting<00:00:13.889> values<00:00:14.190> aside<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
interesting values aside from just the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.939 
interesting values aside from just the
pentatonic<00:00:15.299> scale<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:16.830> I'll

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
pentatonic scale so first of all I'll

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.910 
pentatonic scale so first of all I'll
just<00:00:17.070> play<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:21.439> it's<00:00:22.439> also<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.769> great

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
just play it for you it's also a great

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.529 
just play it for you it's also a great
technical<00:00:23.369> exercise<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> get<00:00:24.180> both<00:00:24.359> your

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
technical exercise to get both your

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.599 
technical exercise to get both your
picking<00:00:24.869> hand<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.439> some<00:00:25.830> llegado<00:00:26.130> happening

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
picking hand and some llegado happening

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.070 
picking hand and some llegado happening
with<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.820> left<00:00:26.970> hand<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.750> let's<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.050> through

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
with your left hand so let's go through

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
with your left hand so let's go through
it<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.369> simple<00:00:29.609> pattern<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.150> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it it's a very simple pattern that just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120 
it it's a very simple pattern that just
repeats<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> first<00:00:31.170> three<00:00:31.470> strings<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
repeats up the first three strings and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
repeats up the first three strings and
finally<00:00:32.700> finishes<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.270> an<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.809> fourth

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
finally finishes with an a on the fourth

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
finally finishes with an a on the fourth
string<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.670> fifth<00:00:35.880> position<00:00:36.030> which

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
string it's in fifth position which

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
string it's in fifth position which
means<00:00:36.899> first<00:00:37.290> finger<00:00:37.559> covers<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> fifth<00:00:38.219> fret

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
means first finger covers the fifth fret

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
means first finger covers the fifth fret
third<00:00:39.149> finger<00:00:39.329> covers<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> seventh<00:00:40.200> fret<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
third finger covers the seventh fret and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.280 
third finger covers the seventh fret and
when<00:00:41.190> he<00:00:41.399> covers<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> eighth<00:00:41.910> fret<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.960> starts

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
when he covers the eighth fret it starts

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.619 
when he covers the eighth fret it starts
with<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> thinking<00:00:44.090> first<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
with you thinking first of all we have a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.279 
with you thinking first of all we have a
Down<00:00:45.870> stroke<00:00:47.570> upstroke<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> seventh<00:00:49.170> fret

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
Down stroke upstroke on the seventh fret

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.549 
Down stroke upstroke on the seventh fret
with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> third<00:00:49.890> finger<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.690> fourth<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with the third finger and a fourth to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.690 
with the third finger and a fourth to
the<00:00:52.590> fifth<00:00:52.710> fret

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
the fifth fret

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.330 
the fifth fret
yeah<00:00:54.970> so<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:55.900> was<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:59.200> that's<00:00:59.950> essentially

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
yeah so that was and that's essentially

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.800 
yeah so that was and that's essentially
it<00:01:00.460> we<00:01:00.880> didn't<00:01:01.090> move<00:01:01.150> out<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.420> string<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.690> do

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
it we didn't move out the string and do

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.050 
it we didn't move out the string and do
the<00:01:01.930> exact<00:01:02.200> same<00:01:02.230> thing<00:01:05.490> slyly<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.850> third

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
the exact same thing slyly to the third

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
the exact same thing slyly to the third
string<00:01:07.330> as<00:01:07.480> well

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.370 

same<00:01:12.640> thing<00:01:12.880> on<00:01:12.939> each<00:01:13.090> three<00:01:13.390> strings<00:01:13.719> that

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
same thing on each three strings that

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.980 
same thing on each three strings that
was<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:14.890> Down<00:01:15.399> stroke<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.090> an<00:01:16.329> upstroke<00:01:16.780> for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
was a Down stroke and an upstroke for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.340 
was a Down stroke and an upstroke for
the<00:01:17.049> second<00:01:17.409> note<00:01:17.530> each<00:01:17.740> time<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:19.689> up<00:01:20.049> down

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the second note each time down up down

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.040 
the second note each time down up down
up

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
up

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.310 
up
and<00:01:22.380> finally<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.040> finished<00:01:23.370> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> low<00:01:23.730> pay

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and finally we finished on the low pay

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.980 
and finally we finished on the low pay
Oh

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.969 

last<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.259> we<00:01:30.409> added<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.710> little

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
last of all we added a little

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.210 
last of all we added a little
interesting<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.909> tale<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.810> leak

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
interesting a tale to the leak

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.520 
interesting a tale to the leak
so<00:01:34.970> random<00:01:35.420> 9<00:01:35.660> lose<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:36.020> couple<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.440> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
so random 9 lose a couple of the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.940 
so random 9 lose a couple of the
elective<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.890> couple<00:01:37.160> of<00:01:37.250> Bob's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.289 

so<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.069> last<00:01:42.249> little<00:01:42.429> bit<00:01:42.640> after<00:01:42.850> we've<00:01:43.179> hit

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
so that last little bit after we've hit

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.240 
so that last little bit after we've hit
the<00:01:43.329> seventh<00:01:43.719> fret<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.140> or<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.469> fourth<00:01:44.740> string

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.649 

the<00:01:48.250> last<00:01:48.460> little<00:01:48.670> bit<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> pull<00:01:49.329> off<00:01:49.450> of<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
the last little bit is a pull off of a

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.020 
the last little bit is a pull off of a
certain<00:01:49.990> threat<00:01:50.259> on<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.530> third<00:01:50.770> string<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
certain threat on the third string and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.280 
certain threat on the third string and
then<00:01:55.179> finally<00:01:55.689> finishing<00:01:56.170> back<00:01:56.319> on<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.590> air

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
then finally finishing back on the air

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.660 
then finally finishing back on the air
so<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.760> whole<00:01:59.940> thing<00:02:00.180> goes

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.380 

or<00:02:04.670> even<00:02:04.940> slow<00:02:05.240> down<00:02:07.119> up<00:02:08.119> down<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:09.470> down

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.950 

now<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.210> first<00:02:15.510> Chinese

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
now and that's it that first Chinese

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.770 
now and that's it that first Chinese
girls<00:02:16.290> look<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> week
