00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.960
 all the dead cuticle on the skin 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.730
 dead heels and once we do 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.970
 that we are going to use our salts our 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.370
 scrum that look like it has like an oil and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.370
 it also smells delicious and with that we go 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.770
 to exfoliate the feet once the 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.310

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.070
 quit 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.680
 about five minutes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.409
 we put it on and it starts to dry 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.290
 and already after about 5 minutes we started 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.940

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.310

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.650
 finished removing the east of the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.570
 Exfoliating will remove the mask 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 to leave the sensation of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.940
 feet and finally let's put 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.780
