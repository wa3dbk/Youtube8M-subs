filling let that cool and then we're

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.680 
filling let that cool and then we're
going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> prepare<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.370> topping<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.420> the

tablespoon of grated orange rind stir
that<00:03:47.300> together<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.920> could<00:03:49.070> probably<00:03:49.310> use<00:03:49.550> the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
that together you could probably use the

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.730 
that together you could probably use the
instant<00:03:50.090> oats<00:03:50.150> for<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:51.050> asks<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.470> rolled

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
instant oats for this it asks for rolled

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.590 
instant oats for this it asks for rolled
oats<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.160> not<00:03:52.400> instant<00:03:52.820> but<00:03:53.060> I'm<00:03:53.180> sure<00:03:53.420> either

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
oats and not instant but I'm sure either

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.930 
oats and not instant but I'm sure either
one<00:03:53.840> can<00:03:53.990> work<00:03:54.200> quite<00:03:54.530> nicely<00:03:54.560> for<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.190> then

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
one can work quite nicely for this then

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.090 
one can work quite nicely for this then
add<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.480> cup<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.720> cold<00:03:57.110> butter<00:03:57.410> that's<00:03:57.950> been

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
add one cup of cold butter that's been

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.580 
add one cup of cold butter that's been
cubed<00:03:58.610> now<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.480> need<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.900> cut<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.350> butter

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
cubed now you need to cut the butter

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.150 
cubed now you need to cut the butter
into<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:01.570> oat<00:04:02.570> mixture<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.770> can<00:04:03.950> use<00:04:04.130> a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
into the oat mixture you can use a

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.810 
into the oat mixture you can use a
pastry<00:04:04.670> cutter<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:05.300> I<00:04:05.480> have<00:04:05.720> here<00:04:06.820> cutting

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
pastry cutter like I have here cutting

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.040 
pastry cutter like I have here cutting
in<00:04:07.940> means<00:04:08.180> used<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.450> break<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.630> butter<00:04:08.870> up

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
in means used to break the butter up

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.720 
in means used to break the butter up
with<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.260> small<00:04:09.500> pieces<00:04:09.770> and<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.190> realize<00:04:10.580> at

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
with the small pieces and I realize at

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.840 
with the small pieces and I realize at
this<00:04:10.820> point<00:04:10.910> that<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.330> forgot<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.260> sugar<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.850> I

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
this point that I forgot the sugar and I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.970 
this point that I forgot the sugar and I
