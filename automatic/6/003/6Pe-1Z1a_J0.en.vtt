00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
run it just click on run full benchmark

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.320 
run it just click on run full benchmark
and<00:01:03.530> there<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.100> starting<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> run<00:01:05.670> mmm

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and there you go and starting to run mmm

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.800 
and there you go and starting to run mmm
so<00:01:06.660> I'm<00:01:07.320> running<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.010> sort<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> stock<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so I'm running this sort of stock so I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.070 
so I'm running this sort of stock so I
haven't<00:01:10.320> added<00:01:10.800> anything<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.840> optimize<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
haven't added anything to optimize this

particular device here there are lots of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
particular device here there are lots of
ways<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.690> can<00:01:15.930> optimize<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.710> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
ways you can optimize that if you just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
ways you can optimize that if you just
google<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.940> wary<00:01:18.870> though

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
google that you have to be wary though

some of these hacks will possibly mess

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840 
some of these hacks will possibly mess
up<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.650> device<00:01:22.920> i'm<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> try<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
up your device i'm going to try some of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450 
up your device i'm going to try some of
them<00:01:23.970> later<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.660> right<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.160> but<00:01:26.160> some<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> the

them later not right now but some of the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.520 
them later not right now but some of the
hacks<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.910> significantly<00:01:27.750> improve<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
hacks will significantly improve the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
hacks will significantly improve the

speed of your device some of the hacks

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.490 
speed of your device some of the hacks
will<00:01:31.580> be<00:01:32.580> thing<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.330> like<00:01:33.540> increase

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
will be thing to do things like increase

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.680 
will be thing to do things like increase
your<00:01:34.710> processor<00:01:35.610> speed<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.150> may<00:01:36.480> or<00:01:36.510> may

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
your processor speed which may or may

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.770 
your processor speed which may or may
not<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:37.020> good<00:01:37.230> thing<00:01:37.550> as<00:01:38.550> well<00:01:38.940> as<00:01:39.210> optimizer

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
not be a good thing as well as optimizer

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
not be a good thing as well as optimizer
and<00:01:39.960> things<00:01:40.260> like<00:01:40.440> moving<00:01:41.130> things<00:01:41.520> around<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and things like moving things around to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.930 
and things like moving things around to
the<00:01:42.360> SD<00:01:42.480> card<00:01:42.690> or<00:01:43.350> creating<00:01:44.070> buffers<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
the SD card or creating buffers that

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.820 
the SD card or creating buffers that
allow<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.750> machine<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.230> run<00:01:46.380> more

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
allow the machine to run more

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.860 
allow the machine to run more
efficiently<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.640> i'll<00:01:48.120> definitely<00:01:48.450> testing

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
efficiently so i'll definitely testing

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.280 
efficiently so i'll definitely testing
some<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.140> those<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.440> but<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:49.980> just<00:01:50.010> stock

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
some of those out but this is just stock

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.980 
some of those out but this is just stock
you<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.560> ran<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.070> cpu<00:01:53.520> tests<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.750> going

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you see it ran the cpu tests it is going

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.010 
you see it ran the cpu tests it is going

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
to run a memory test it's doing a visual
test<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.800> it's<00:01:59.010> pretty<00:01:59.220> neat<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.520> could

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
test here so it's pretty neat you could

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.810 
test here so it's pretty neat you could
actually<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.510> results<00:02:01.410> as<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.830> as<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
actually see the results as you as you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.860 
actually see the results as you as you
go<00:02:03.000> through<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.300> now<00:02:03.330> it's<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.660> doing

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
go through right now it's you're doing

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.610 
go through right now it's you're doing
some<00:02:04.050> 3d<00:02:04.350> rendering<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> i<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.230> play<00:02:07.380> games

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
some 3d rendering so i don't play games

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.979 
some 3d rendering so i don't play games
but<00:02:08.069> i<00:02:08.310> guess<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.970> did<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:09.869> be

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
but i guess if I did then this would be

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.140 
but i guess if I did then this would be
a<00:02:10.020> pretty<00:02:10.440> nice<00:02:10.619> interface<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.430> walking

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
a pretty nice interface to see walking

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.309 
a pretty nice interface to see walking
through<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> 3d<00:02:13.260> world

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
through a 3d world

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
through a 3d world
okay<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:18.560> couple<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:20.569> planets<00:02:21.569> there<00:02:21.780> are

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
okay so a couple of planets there are

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.410 
okay so a couple of planets there are
blended<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.800> moon<00:02:26.060> testing<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.090> math

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
blended with the moon testing the math

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.949 
blended with the moon testing the math

it's<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.080> send<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.410> benchmark<00:02:34.920> results

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it's going to send the benchmark results

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.089 
it's going to send the benchmark results
and<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.750> see<00:02:37.080> wondering<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.890> see

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
and you can see wondering if you can see

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.020 
and you can see wondering if you can see
them<00:02:38.250> my<00:02:39.030> device<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:40.280> right<00:02:41.280> where<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.000> should

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
them my device is right where it should

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.360 
them my device is right where it should
be<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.810> stock<00:02:43.110> samsung<00:02:43.680> galaxy<00:02:44.220> s<00:02:44.340> is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
be so the stock samsung galaxy s is

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
be so the stock samsung galaxy s is
right<00:02:44.790> below<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.300> faster<00:02:45.450> than<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
right below so it's faster than the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.410 
right below so it's faster than the
stock<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.500> whatever<00:02:46.799> reason<00:02:47.160> droid<00:02:48.090> x<00:02:48.209> is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
stock for whatever reason droid x is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.240 
stock for whatever reason droid x is
above<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.900> interesting<00:02:49.709> let<00:02:49.799> me<00:02:49.890> note<00:02:50.040> that

there's two entries for nexus one one

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.580 
there's two entries for nexus one one

the 2.1 or below so when we upgrade our
devices<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.560> 2.2<00:03:05.040> should<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.549> significant

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
devices to 2.2 should see significant

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.600 
devices to 2.2 should see significant
increases<00:03:06.299> in<00:03:06.690> speed<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.250> thing<00:03:08.370> i<00:03:08.489> am

and oh let me run it again there you go
run<00:03:57.180> full<00:03:57.450> benchmark<00:03:58.220> I'm<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.400> pause

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
run full benchmark I'm going to pause

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.960 
run full benchmark I'm going to pause
here<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:02.130> don't<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.520> watch

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970

here and then so you don't have to watch
this<00:04:03.000> again<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.690> I'm<00:04:03.870> going<00:04:03.960> to<00:04:04.110> be<00:04:04.260> right

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
this again and I'm going to be right

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.830 
this again and I'm going to be right
back<00:04:06.890> alright<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.070> ran<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.940> let's<00:04:09.330> just<00:04:09.630> see

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
back alright it ran so let's just see

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.160 
back alright it ran so let's just see
what<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:09.990> results<00:04:10.470> are<00:04:11.810> see<00:04:12.810> if<00:04:12.930> there<00:04:13.080> were

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
what the results are see if there were

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.630 
what the results are see if there were
any<00:04:13.200> difference<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:13.710> basically<00:04:14.490> no

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
any difference so basically no

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.280 
any difference so basically no
difference<00:04:15.060> or<00:04:15.270> even<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:15.660> you've<00:04:15.840> got<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.020> bunch

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
difference or even if you've got a bunch

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.990 
difference or even if you've got a bunch
of<00:04:16.410> apps<00:04:16.590> running<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.100> doesn't<00:04:17.580> seem<00:04:17.760> to

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
of apps running it doesn't seem to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.810 
of apps running it doesn't seem to
change<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.350> benchmark<00:04:19.739> results<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.670> that's

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
change the benchmark results so that's
