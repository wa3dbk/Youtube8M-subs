00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.390
 The plot speaks about Switzerland, right? 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.160
 in fact it's a point that is not what we 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.560
 we discovered in the research through 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.039
 carlinhos that our researcher and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 clévis bornay a very well-known figure 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.949
 of the carioca carnival is descending 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.610
 from swiss then actually bornay clévis 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.940
 account against the Swiss 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 that's where we got all this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.040
 universe this to a cláudio character 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.890
 Bonatto and within that point we will go 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 Talk about legends, people will talk about everything. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.690
 what involved us that made us travel 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 to the Swiss we saw there and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.280
 We brought technology back here. 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.899
 Legends is is the cuisine at all involved 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.899
 in this great story 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 I usually say that Paul left the door 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 open because the paulo think it made almost 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.689
 everything that could be done within the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.850
 carnival tijuca can not get away from the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.000
 style of play will be the school that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.460
 people can play in any way 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.229
 We're free to play the game. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 that we want, I draw mauro 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.740
 also draws bye frames 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 wells are in the most technical 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 development of fantasy allegory 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.060
 is the researcher or five 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.070
 thinking heads each has its own 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.350
 ability has its competence and we 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 we are adding adding 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
 knowledge adding right values and the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.170
 work is flowing 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.030
 going to the united of tijuca that has the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 my friends rodrigo and priscilla who 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.979
 really revolutionized the concept of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.649
 front commission is even more one 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.869
 has yet another pressure on the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.759
 union during game was champion in 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.700
 last carnival then so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.080
 This really motivates me, yes. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 challenges makes me want to make me more is to have 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.959
 more willingness to prove it 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.269
 to be all right with the class what ideas 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.250
 come to revolutionize but at the same time 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.890
 time, you do not have to balance 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.680
 keep a tradition but at the same time 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.799
 you can not also stay the same 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 in the same way even in the same way 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:48.730
 see the carnival trial and changed from 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 carnival march that has changed since 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.500
 the mission is different, but also that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.299
 we brought a big name there or the alex that 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.349
 is a person who harasses who will make a 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.329
 great work 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.889
 So we do not worry about judging 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.480
 lost its finished base with more 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.430
 valued at school is their community. 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.750
 on the whole a work that he comes 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 doing for many years 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.109
 so people are passengers to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.109
 college stay
