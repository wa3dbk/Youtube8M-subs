you<00:04:17.199> know<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.470> different<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:19.419> know<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.540> think

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
you know it's different you know I think

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.689 
you know it's different you know I think
obviously<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.380> big<00:04:20.590> guys<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.980> play<00:04:21.340> tonight

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
obviously the big guys that play tonight

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.210 
obviously the big guys that play tonight
though<00:04:22.050> you<00:04:23.050> know<00:04:23.169> they<00:04:23.380> can<00:04:23.530> at<00:04:23.620> least<00:04:23.740> sort

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
though you know they can at least sort

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.650 
though you know they can at least sort
of<00:04:24.340> sleeping<00:04:24.639> in<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.850> morning<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> one<00:04:25.419> thing

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
of sleeping in the morning the one thing

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.240 
of sleeping in the morning the one thing
that<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.840> big<00:04:26.169> difference<00:04:26.560> between<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
that is big difference between the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.340 
that is big difference between the
playing<00:04:27.729> during<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.570> day<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.780> course<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.320> lot

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
playing during the day of course a lot

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.260 
playing during the day of course a lot
quicker<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.949> in<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.160> evening<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.669> it's

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
quicker and in the evening it's it's

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.810 
quicker and in the evening it's it's
much<00:04:31.510> slower<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:33.100> played<00:04:33.370> well<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.610> that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
much slower and I played well in that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.490 
much slower and I played well in that
the<00:04:33.970> slower<00:04:34.210> conditions<00:04:34.780> struggled<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> little

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
the slower conditions struggled a little

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.030 
the slower conditions struggled a little
bit<00:04:35.770> early<00:04:36.340> on<00:04:36.460> today<00:04:36.790> but<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.300> think<00:04:38.110> yeah<00:04:38.710> it's

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
bit early on today but I think yeah it's

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.129 
bit early on today but I think yeah it's
not<00:04:39.250> going<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.610> too<00:04:39.820> much<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.270> an<00:04:40.690> arm<00:04:41.020> or

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
not going to have too much of an arm or

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.040 
not going to have too much of an arm or
bearing<00:04:41.620> on<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.860> match<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.280> just<00:04:42.490> hope<00:04:42.669> that

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
bearing on the match I just hope that

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.320 
bearing on the match I just hope that
