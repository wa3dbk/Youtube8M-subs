many kills you have and go down to those
with<00:00:18.300> less<00:00:18.539> than<00:00:18.720> 100<00:00:19.170> these<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.160> probably

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
with less than 100 these are probably

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.730 
with less than 100 these are probably
your<00:00:20.760> least<00:00:21.060> used<00:00:21.359> weapons<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.960> today<00:00:22.320> they

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
briefcases and yes I know these weapons

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.540 
briefcases and yes I know these weapons
are<00:00:28.439> probably<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> ones<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.519> think

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
are probably the ones that you think

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
are probably the ones that you think
sucks<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> most<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.349> less

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
sucks the most because you have less

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
sucks the most because you have less
than<00:00:31.679> hundred<00:00:31.949> kills<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:33.360> me<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
really bad DMR at least for me the next

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
really bad DMR at least for me the next
one<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.620> pecheneg<00:00:44.239> it's<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.360> light<00:00:45.539> machine

usually don't use it at all it hits like
a<00:00:51.300> hammer<00:00:51.539> though<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> try<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.320> maybe

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a hammer though so try it out or maybe

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
a hammer though so try it out or maybe
you<00:00:56.309> already<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.780> me<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you already have for me this is one of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
you already have for me this is one of
my<00:00:58.920> least<00:00:59.070> used<00:00:59.579> like<00:01:00.180> machine<00:01:00.570> guns<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
my least used like machine guns in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.319 
my least used like machine guns in the
game

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
game

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.460 
game
actually<00:01:03.329> didn't<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.140> after

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
actually didn't like it more after

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
actually didn't like it more after
filling<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.580> 200<00:01:06.290> hits<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.860> close<00:01:08.189> range

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
filling up 200 hits hard at close range

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
filling up 200 hits hard at close range
I<00:01:08.850> guess<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> hits<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.810> long<00:01:09.990> range<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.740> got

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I guess it hits hard at long range I got

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
I guess it hits hard at long range I got
my<00:01:11.490> 30<00:01:11.880> kills<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
my 30 kills with it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
my 30 kills with it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
actually like this more than the m39 but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.539 
actually like this more than the m39 but
I<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> Mars<00:01:33.020> at<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.310> mostly<00:01:35.310> Mars

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I don't like the Mars at all mostly Mars

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.330 
I don't like the Mars at all mostly Mars
suck<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> SKS<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> was

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
suck all right I like the SKS it was

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
suck all right I like the SKS it was
actually<00:01:38.909> quite<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> other<00:01:40.680> day

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
actually quite good all the other day

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
actually quite good all the other day
Mars<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> less<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:41.759> hundred<00:01:42.210> kills

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Mars have a less than hundred kills

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.109 
Mars have a less than hundred kills
though<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.790> ones<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
though these two are the ones that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.560 
though these two are the ones that
actually<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.869> closest<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.790> getting<00:01:47.790> unlocks

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.569 

so<00:01:51.570> I've<00:01:52.200> been<00:01:52.350> using<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> magnifier

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
so I've been using this with a magnifier

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.800 
so I've been using this with a magnifier
and<00:01:54.290> with<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> 4x<00:01:55.799> scope<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.420> those<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and with a 4x scope and all those you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
and with a 4x scope and all those you
should<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> any<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:01.200> shoot

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
should do it any other way I just shoot

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
should do it any other way I just shoot
away<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.759> should<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.060> quite<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> bit

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
away I think I should like quite a bit

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980 
away I think I should like quite a bit
too<00:02:04.619> fast<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.450> maybe<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.540> should<00:02:06.719> wait<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
too fast with them maybe I should wait a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.440 
too fast with them maybe I should wait a
bit<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.190> recoil<00:02:08.550> cooldown<00:02:09.830> next<00:02:10.830> up<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
bit for the recoil cooldown next up a
