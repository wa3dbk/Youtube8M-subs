00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 one to our explorer 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.439
 go to this page that is java dotcom 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.330

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.489

 let's click here is going to start a 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.910
 discharge 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.040
 there they go to their downloads folder and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.870
 find in this excel point 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 once you find this and you get 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.870
 install everything they will finish inside take 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.260
 very little time one that ends up in this 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.199
 and have the latest java running that 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.000
 is the main thing to play minecraft a 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.489
 Once we have finished this we can 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.510
 sink to the next step that is to go 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.510
 to minecraft 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.040
 net point 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.020
 is the official page of the game here what 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.329
 what we have to do is register in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.979
 the game even if we do not go to 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.960
 turn it off we have to register here 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.320
 clicking once we are there 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.090
 we have to load our user 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.780
 or the user that we want to use the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.340
 password as a loose larva and an email 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.990
 that I recommend it to be a gmail and 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.220
 that for the next step we will need 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.070
 use the google account 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.260
 well once we finish this is going 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.400
 to send an email to our our 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.170
 email and we have to 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.870
 confirm among other things you already know the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.090
 standard procedure now we have to 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.520
 go to the second step 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.920
 what is manchester point spot 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.140
 This is the one that makes us play 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.190
 what they have to do for free is here 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.550
 enter where the login says 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.490
 click there when loading your data just 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.850
 in the mail they put their email their password and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.270
 they make themselves disconnected and automatically 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 connects you with your Manchester account 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.880
 normally when it 's their first time they 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.760
 asks a question if it is that you 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.320
 They want to accept Manchester as their 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.720
 account to use as a number of 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.090
 user and all those things that have 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.100
 that give accept then connects you 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.720
 automatically once they are here 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.760
 inside what they have to do is where 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.820
 says connection minecraft account have 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.530
 that they have to put connection and not like 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.350
 appears you have to change 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.140
 to change and this is where they load the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 data that previously loaded here 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 you have to put this same user 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.900
 copy and paste then here and the same 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.900
 password 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.180
 and once they connect there they get 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.950
 connection and they get this correctly 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.080
 means that the two of you both 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.760
 two pages will be synchronized once 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.410
 that happened, they should not have 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.600
 problems to play the game so 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.950
 free now it sounds in the part of 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.650
 downloads here 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.010
 and they begin to leave the first file that 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.530
 despite 24 head and the last file that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.640
 95- head weight are reality are not only 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.410
 for the Yankee boatman team 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.330
 others go here and what you have to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.760
 do now is to grab these two 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.580
 files that just came down to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.800
 select cut and I recommend them to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.470
 create an exclusive folder to mark 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.380
 I have a here where the great see 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.330
 those files that just went down 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.410
 you click here on this they say 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.770
 Manchester Proxy 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.510
 already in running home within the game 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.880
 from the hub the java is needed so that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.090
 work well this here they load their 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.090
 users your password and go options and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.640
 there you have force ilo app to appear on 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.040
 will force case did not get up and you 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.560
 They give login that will not start to download 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.300
 the game is going to take a while then 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.740
 while this game is coming down 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.900
 I want to show you other things very 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.730
 important you know how to the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.100
 windows screen to execute do the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.020
 windows way sign and you get this 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.290
 what they have to write would be this 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.330
 that but the percentage appdata sign 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.530
 percentage again arias that would have 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.670
 this is given to accept pillar a folder 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.130
 this folder is where your game is saved 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.689
 minecraft was targeted minecraft the drawer 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.169
 of have everything saved 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.810
 here they go to six and here are all the 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.490
 saved worlds 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.220
 as you can see here I already have many 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.800
 points but when you start they go 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.970
 to have only one then what I give them 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.240
 I recommend saying that you want 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.240
 to start you can go to youtube 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.409
 they go to my channel 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.469
 here 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.050
 in all the videos that I uploaded in the 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.830
 part of the description appears a link 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.710
 then copy that link 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.300
 or open it directly to a media blog 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.170
 in this place is where they can lower the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.360
 world 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.450
 you can test and see 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.740
 if you like what I have already done 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.260
 then once they download this file 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.210
 what is a sip 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.760
 when you finish downloading to megaupload take 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.060
 the 30 seconds among other things 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.520
 they go here they are copied that file in 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.669
 this folder that we just saw that is 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.560
 so like that so on 6 and decompress the 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.680
 file here then it will go to 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.449
 every type number 1 if I'm not wrong 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.729
 then once that it was in 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.419
 that finished downloading everything works 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.830
 dial 1.0 zero point and area always and 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.720
 This world is going to look like it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.830
 They finished downloading the file mega 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.190
 Blog 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.110
 this one has to wait a little while here 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.020
 ends down that as I explained 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.300
 previously if they give you and enter 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:04.120
 as you can see everything works without 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.590
 problems recognize this house 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.820
