00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.200
 almost the size of my shirt pocket 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.640
 here you have for the bravest of the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.800
 maximum of six with three inches 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.560
 let's talk about him 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.590
 Well, today we have the presentation 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.920
 of the mega galaxy then as always 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.869
 let's see a little how is how is 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.240
 physically here on the side as you see 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.700
 the typical volume keys on the other 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 the power button up what 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.329
 we have is the connector for helmets 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 one of the two microphones and a port 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.480
 infrared like for example with the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.550
 can you control television is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.440
 quite interesting in the lower area 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 of the connector for charging another 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 microphone for noise reduction the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.300
 back here we have a speaker 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.859
 with the detail that is a little 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.039
 raised so that if we support the 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.109
 phone on the table because it does not 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.359
 let's keep fighting well go up here 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.879
 we have the camera with its flash 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.769
 after samsung typical and good we passed 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.129
 to describe the specifications 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.920
 techniques of what the engine is the the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.140
 mega galaxy guts and a screen 6 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 with 3 inches with super technology 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.110
 clear lcd and a resolution of 1280 x 720 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 does not mean that it is hd the processor that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 brings us is a dual core to 1.7 has 8 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.490
 gigabytes of internal memory expandable with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.799
 micro sd fortunately 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.619
 the camera that it brings is 8 megapixels and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.899
 19 is the front for video calls the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 battery is quite large are 3200 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.229
 milliamps and samsung in the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.220
 official specifications assures us 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.420
 that will last us up to 11 hours 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.710
 then regarding design details 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 as for example you can see here below 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.549
 the keys can only physically see 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 this and if we click on the others 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.149
 they appear to us there but not because they are 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.189
 totally invisible to the few 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.020
 seconds disappears with respect to the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.159
 connectivity as very very complete as 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 you can imagine one of the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.440
 leading terminals of the Korean brand 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.170
 4g support has wifi in the bands 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.880
 of 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bluetooth 4.0 nfc 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 gps dlna which means that we can 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.840
 send wireless signal to television 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 m hl which means that by the port 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 We can plug in a charge 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.140
 adapter to take the output of 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.830
 video of 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.180
 of hdmi and as I previously cited by 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.770
 its infrared size to handle the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.630
 television also quite interesting 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.069
 on a device that is completely 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.020
 on horseback between the tablet and the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.540
 smartphone 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.340
 then regarding the use of smartphone 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.930
 you can say that maybe the screen is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.610
 great and man is true I have a 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.320
 medium hand size is neither large nor 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.850
 small and of course I find it 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.430
 totally impossible to get up with 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.020
 the big toe then of course yes 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.030
 Acquiring this device must have 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.920
 clear that the management is with one hand and 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.020
 with the other possible moving by typing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.459
 and then later I show you these 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.260
 we will also teach a little trick that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 facilitate a little more life at the time 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.300
 of typing numbers with one hand we have 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.130
 of course the usual use and the barÃ§a 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.720
 the one that more to realize is to put them to have it 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.190
 to subject with the left hand and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.730
 driving with the right in the case of 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.150
 that 6 righties the android that brings that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.909
 4.2 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.709
 with a weight of 199 grams is not very 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.720
 heavy of course it is very much appreciated 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.030
 that despite being so big I did not think 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.790
 a lot 422 is the version that brings 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.200
 installed the last one that has samsung and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.230
 the union that has android also by 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.340
 course the thickness is 8 mm 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.049
 I was doing tests in the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.870
 pocket or fits has to be a 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.459
 normal size pocket do not wait 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.959
 put it in a tiny pocket of about 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.000
 shorts summer time 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.930
 because it will not enter has second a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.030
 normal size pocket 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.280
 logically 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 regarding the screen logically with 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.630
 the size it has is ideal for 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.950
 perform multitasking as per 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.140
 example have the google chrome in the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.060
 top of the screen and be 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.560
 well with the google maps and seeing where 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.150
 is any of our addresses that 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.060
 we have to search the browser and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.100
 As you can see, it is really useful and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.020
 the power of the processor allows us 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.440
 move around the two screens so 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.020
 Well, totally comfortable 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.270
 this is what you will enjoy in case of 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.410
 that you have the galaxy mega to yours 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.070
 disposition in our stores with 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.810
 house 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.540
 You can buy it at any time and 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.760
 good that you know that you are not going to 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.050
 disappoint especially for its size of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.230
 screen you are going to leave to the whole world 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.230
 bowled over
