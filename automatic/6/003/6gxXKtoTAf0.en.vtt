 we have our helitransport where 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 we have our ships or planes that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.390
 they serve to send heroes to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 remote operations this consists in that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 we can not use the hero we have 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 chosen to fulfill the remote operation 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 for some time so that when 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 when we increase the level of our 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 planes and the one of our heroes eye only 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.350
 the heroes can not be sent to the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 good people and the higher the level 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 that will be added to the reward of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 special operations good in the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 top of the game window 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 We have a miniature photo of our 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.870
 next agent we have the name of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.850

 and the experience points of the people 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.260
 on the right we have the energy that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.480

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.150
 of level and every time we do this 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 we will receive certain rewards the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.410
 energy is what allows us to do 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 missions which will give us experience 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.360

 It also serves to buy things in the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 store or to exchange it for points 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 yield command or made the unstable 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.340
 points commands are used to buy a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.710
 the heroes and buy them an idiomes the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810

 shop made them eight unstable they serve 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.580
 to do special operations 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.860
 the safes serve so that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.020
 we can get rewards but the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.680
 most important of these are the covers 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 with the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.959
 we can recruit villains and join them to 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.299
 our squad good to the left 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.549
 we have the list of tasks which 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.400
 they give us rewards under this 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.590
 we have the game news below 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.959
 the mission option we have player against 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.060
 player in which I will explain more to 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.670
 detail in the next good guide after 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.639
 we have the store our square the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.769
 collections and research the 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.780
 investigations serve to unlock 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.030
 more research also for 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.129
 unlock more objects in the store and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.439
 to receive some more good things 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.689
 now let's see my squad as you can see 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.639
 I do not have all the heroes but I have 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.709
 a good squad good every hero 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.870
 has attributes like black cat that 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.450
 despite not having attributes with his suit 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.579
 normal has two great attributes good 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.769
 some heroes have certain attributes 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.780
 repeated well there are certain heroes that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.359
 with their normal suit they have no attributes 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.419
 but with other suits or uniforms have 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.730
 attributes the uniforms despite 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.219
 give us more attributes can change us 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.989
 of class only if we buy the uniform 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.980
 that a different class than we have 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.659
 besides 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.909
 certain heroes to whom they 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.370
 let's change the uniform they will change 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.349
 attacks as in the case of ironman the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.840
 which since the attacks changed 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.000
 with the suit marc 42 of the film 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.970
 it improved a lot and well this also 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.129
 must to the updates in the game 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.660
 There are several types of classes each 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.450
 class has advantages and disadvantages 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.790
 against other classes the detonating class 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.709
 has advantages before the guard class the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.599
 guard class has advantages before the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.099
 fighter the fighter has 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.659
 advantages before the spy 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.700
 the spy has advantages before the 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.709
 strategist the strategist has advantages 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
 before the detonator and the generalists not 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.030
 have disadvantages or advantages before others 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.489
 classes for the disadvantages of the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.480
 classes so let's go backwards strategist 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.310
 spy fighter fuse guard 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.590
 the team we can put in our 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.930
 boxes made which depending on which 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.269
 will it improve us between life the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.030
 endure the attack the defense the 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.400
 accuracy and evasion missions 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.160
 we have the deployments that they give us 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.950
 certain rewards we have the missions 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.760
 of medium and high low level together 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.490
 mini heads 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.680
 the bosses good now knowing all this 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.870
 let's see some heroes and my agent in 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.880
 action and to do it better let's see a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.820
 mission with several mini bosses and the boss 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.980
 at the same time here we have the weapons 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.930
 from my agent every weapons space 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.510
 of my agent is unlocked by reaching 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.880
 some level plus the recharge button the 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.430
 inventory the help flames that 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.140
 work only once and the store which 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.180
 it's not the same as we have when 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.590
 we do missions, it's also something 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.750
 unusable since what we want 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.780
 we have to buy here, we'll buy it 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.730
 with gold in the missions so much we 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.000
 as our opponents we can have 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.070
 attributes like disadvantages good for 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.320
 conclude every time we finish a 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.240
 mission we will receive a score for 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.580
 this one and with so much level of punctuation 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.190
 we will receive a star which 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.100
 will give us certain rewards which 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.550
 they are with a star they give us 250 of 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.220
 silver with 2000 silver with 3 100 points 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.740
 of experience for the agent with 4 us 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.960
 give a gold and with 5 give us five points 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.120
 command and when we have 30 stars 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.569
 in a chapter we will receive a weapon of 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.879
 gold 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.610
 eye this serves only in normal visions 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.529
 not in special operations good now 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.659
 who know the basics already have a very 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.889
 good idea of ​​the game so see you 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.889
 until next time
