00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.720
 Greetings friends I bring you now another 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.250
 economic protein breakfast to a 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 fraction of what you would leave 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.760
 usually 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.910
 and let's start it's called egg pie 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.180
 with ham and we'll need an egg 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.580
 whole one egg white 150 grams of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.130
 ham in cubes 100 grams of pepper 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.380
 sweet or chili morrón onion to taste and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.929
 salt to taste the first thing we're going to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.410
 to do is separate the egg white and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.440
 previously we are going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.200
 to put the other whole egg this is not 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.240
 we remove the yolks I put 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.030
 pepper black pepper to grip 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.890
 more flavor if you do not have to not put it on 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.060
 after this we are going to beat the mixture 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.910
 with a fork 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.150
 since it is well mixed we are going to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.220
 proceed to apply the morrón in cubes and 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.610
 the onion also the ham because 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.670
 we had 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.370
 now we put the morrón and the onion in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.670
 a Teflon pan to avoid using oil 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.070
 by the pan was hot what 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.100
 we leave there are about 23 minutes until the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.530
 Onion is a medium brown 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.960
 transparent here in this step also 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.180
 I forgot to put ham was pretty 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.030
 concentrated taking the pictures that I got 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.090
 forgot here you put the ham and leave it 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.730
 two or three minutes and the furniture with the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.730
 shovel to get the flavor 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.600
 I also threw some chilies to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 grab flavor you do not like chile 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.860
 so do not put 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.260
 what follows is now to take the clear 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 good the egg mixture we made 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.050
 to this we throw it all the distributes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 we distribute it very well and this is where 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.000
 comes the magic you have to cover the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.330
 pan with water and I used this tray 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.060
 so you can make the cake already 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.930
 look there, leave it 5 minutes on low heat 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.420
 lower the flame as much as you can 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.829
 and this is done is the result or is it done 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.829
 as well as a sponge cake 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.110
 well, good 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.170
 only as an annotation I'm not going to 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.750
 forget with the ham in the step that you 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.720
 I said now we are going to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.460
 to show how much nutritional contribution 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.120
 have 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.910
 also like comment this ham that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.240
 I put him here is special is what I 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.450
 It's economical and after a while I talk to you 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.930
 what 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.170
 this is the recipe gave us 45 grams of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.660
 protein 100 grams of fat 10 grams 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.239
 of fat rather and 8 grams of 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.190
 carbohydrates save the balance 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.860
 nutritional goes much more to the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.530
 proteins making it a good 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.450
 tool for those who seek to win 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.540
 muscle also in addition to this 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.010
 this dish brings you complex sees the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.690
 b1 b2 b3 b6 and b12 this completes 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.690
 100% practically 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.040
 and also the vitamin c 'big' at 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.100
 morron also the two of the bay complex 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.290
 Vitamin C are very important for 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.050
 any athlete looking to increase their 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.770
 musculature now I tell you why the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:45.490
 ham is special because it helps us 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.460
 lower costs this ham 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.920
 it's being the 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.069
 they sell them in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.000
 in large butchers or big chains 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.850
 Well, butchers 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.490
 but if you want to know how to ask, I'll 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.130
 make an article on my page there you 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.590
 I leave the description with my page 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.320
 description of the video so you can 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.830
 know how to ask it how to look for it you are a 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.859
 ham is not really made from the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.609
 betteries now that you have to know 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:24.480
 How to ask for it to come out 65% 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.000
 less than the price that they normally give 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.150
 and well well there we are not seeing I'm going to 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.150
