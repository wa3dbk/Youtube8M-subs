theory to God Amen all right let's get

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.679 
theory to God Amen all right let's get
you<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.699> had<00:00:21.060> three

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
you to it so first of all I had three

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
you to it so first of all I had three
regions<00:00:22.140> outline<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:22.890> adding<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
regions outline to now adding to that

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
regions outline to now adding to that
map<00:00:23.970> um<00:00:24.269> I'll<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.350> over<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.619> again<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:26.130> those

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
map um I'll go over this again for those

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
map um I'll go over this again for those
of<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> who<00:00:26.730> haven't<00:00:26.939> seen<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.650> we<00:00:28.650> have

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
of you who haven't seen it we have

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.450 
of you who haven't seen it we have
region<00:00:29.660> 3<00:00:30.890> region<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.430> region<00:00:32.840> one<00:00:33.840> okay<00:00:34.460> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
region 3 region to region one okay so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
region 3 region to region one okay so
let<00:00:35.790> me<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:37.340> ok<00:00:38.340> again<00:00:38.879> region<00:00:39.300> 3<00:00:39.540> based

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
let me go back ok again region 3 based

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520 
let me go back ok again region 3 based
off<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.410> years<00:00:40.739> based<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:42.350> based<00:00:43.350> off

off in all years based off of based off

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.750 
off in all years based off of based off

the warm PDO cold PDO warm amo in the El
Nino<00:00:48.180> command<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.379> area<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.800> right

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
Nino command this is this area and right

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.750 
Nino command this is this area and right
is<00:00:50.219> most<00:00:50.430> likely<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:51.000> warmer<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.480> drier<00:00:51.899> um

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
is most likely to be warmer and drier um

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.500 
is most likely to be warmer and drier um
again<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.149> preliminary

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
again this is a very preliminary

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.790 
again this is a very preliminary
forecast<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.620> detailed<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.719> then

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
forecast not very detailed and then

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.209 
forecast not very detailed and then
number<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.030> area<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.660> here

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
number two which is this area right here

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.039 
number two which is this area right here
negative<00:01:02.219> ni<00:01:02.430> 0<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.940> 0<00:01:02.969> which<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.570> forecast

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
negative ni 0 and a 0 which I forecast

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.530 
negative ni 0 and a 0 which I forecast
for<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.379> winter<00:01:04.650> um<00:01:06.320> will<00:01:07.320> probably<00:01:07.710> lead<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
for this winter um will probably lead to

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.280 
for this winter um will probably lead to
amplification<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> winter<00:01:09.869> storms

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
amplification of winter storms

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980 
amplification of winter storms
Nor'easters<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> also<00:01:11.580> storms<00:01:12.420> coming<00:01:12.810> out

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
Nor'easters and also storms coming out

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
Nor'easters and also storms coming out
of<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.070> overall<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> area

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of here so overall I think this area

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.280 
of here so overall I think this area
will<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.390> colder<00:01:15.930> um<00:01:17.689> Chloe<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.960> definitely

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
will be colder um Chloe it's definitely

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
will be colder um Chloe it's definitely
gonna<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.439> colder<00:01:19.830> than<00:01:19.950> normal<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
gonna be colder than normal that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
gonna be colder than normal that
confidence<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.270> snowy<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.960> very<00:01:21.990> good

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
confidence a snowy but we have very good

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
confidence a snowy but we have very good
possibility<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:23.070> seeing<00:01:23.250> snowy<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.150> northeast

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
possibility of seeing snowy or northeast

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
possibility of seeing snowy or northeast
than<00:01:25.080> normal<00:01:25.409> I'm<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> again<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.750> area

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
than normal I'm and again one this area

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.870 
than normal I'm and again one this area
right<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:29.060> with<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> El<00:01:30.299> Nino<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.900> favor

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
right here with the El Nino we favor

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.069 
right here with the El Nino we favor
more<00:01:32.880> snow<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.479> um<00:01:34.729> colder<00:01:35.729> conditions<00:01:36.079> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
