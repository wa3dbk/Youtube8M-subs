him we need to be honest to ourselves
and<00:01:04.949> say<00:01:05.070> okay<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.759> wasn't<00:01:06.060> really

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and say okay this is wasn't really

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
and say okay this is wasn't really
working<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.720> strategy<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.259> had<00:01:07.440> wasn't

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
working the strategy that we had wasn't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
working the strategy that we had wasn't
particularly<00:01:08.759> effective<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.479> were

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
particularly effective we were

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
particularly effective we were
delivering<00:01:10.500> products<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.340> were<00:01:11.670> suffering

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
delivering products that were suffering

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
delivering products that were suffering
quality<00:01:12.810> wise<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.649> obviously<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
quality wise and that obviously had an

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.940 
quality wise and that obviously had an
effect<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.520> sales<00:01:14.789> and<00:01:15.149> ultimately<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.800> only

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
effect on sales and ultimately the only

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.529 
effect on sales and ultimately the only
way<00:01:17.039> back<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.429> is<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> reboot<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.300> franchise

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
way back up is to reboot the franchise

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.809 
way back up is to reboot the franchise
do<00:01:19.170> something<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> audience<00:01:20.399> will

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
do something that the audience will

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.820 
do something that the audience will
respect<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.899> then<00:01:22.259> hopefully<00:01:22.800> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
respect and like and then hopefully the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.180 
respect and like and then hopefully the
sales<00:01:23.190> will<00:01:23.399> follow<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.470> wasn't<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.890> hard

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
sales will follow so it wasn't that hard

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.219 
sales will follow so it wasn't that hard
to<00:01:26.399> be<00:01:26.490> honest<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.210> he<00:01:27.750> spoke<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> my

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to be honest it was like he spoke to my

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
to be honest it was like he spoke to my
boss<00:01:28.409> about<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.369> usually<00:01:29.970> agreed<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
boss about it and we usually agreed that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.680 
boss about it and we usually agreed that
we<00:01:30.479> need<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:31.200> developer<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:33.030> can

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
we need to have a developer that can

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.090 
we need to have a developer that can
work<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.080> game<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.440> little<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> long

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
work on a game for a little for a long

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.130 
work on a game for a little for a long
time<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.360> obviously<00:01:36.539> you<00:01:36.899> need

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
time so you know obviously you need

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
time so you know obviously you need
about<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.560> years<00:01:37.709> to<00:01:37.920> make<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.100> high-quality

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
about two years to make a high-quality

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.210 
about two years to make a high-quality
experience<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.289> decided<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.830> put

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
experience and we then decided to put

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
experience and we then decided to put
several<00:01:41.580> developers<00:01:42.209> on<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.750> speed<00:01:43.049> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
several developers on to need speed so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
several developers on to need speed so
we<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.709> and<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.549> part<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> pot

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we can do that and so part of the pot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.449 
we can do that and so part of the pot
the<00:01:45.750> process<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.470> bringing<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.920> criterion

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
the process was bringing in criterion

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.969 
the process was bringing in criterion
who<00:01:47.789> have<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> great<00:01:48.360> pedigree<00:01:48.690> obviously<00:01:49.140> well

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
who have a great pedigree obviously well

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.650 
who have a great pedigree obviously well
known<00:01:50.129> for<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> burnout<00:01:50.729> games<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.629> of

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
known for the burnout games how much of

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.559 
known for the burnout games how much of
burnouts<00:01:52.080> DNA<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:53.009> hot<00:01:53.190> pursuit<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.849> mean

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
burnouts DNA is in hot pursuit I mean

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.559 
burnouts DNA is in hot pursuit I mean
obviously<00:01:55.429> if<00:01:56.429> it<00:01:56.610> comes<00:01:56.819> from<00:01:56.879> a<00:01:57.030> criterion

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
obviously if it comes from a criterion

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.080 
obviously if it comes from a criterion
is<00:01:57.660> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.489> parts<00:01:59.489> and<00:01:59.670> pieces<00:01:59.819> from

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is going to have parts and pieces from

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.669 
is going to have parts and pieces from
burnout<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:01.019> you<00:02:01.140> will<00:02:01.259> recognize

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
burnout that you will recognize

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.609 
burnout that you will recognize
inverness<00:02:02.129> tears<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.489> I<00:02:02.550> do<00:02:02.789> think<00:02:03.209> that<00:02:03.619> it's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
inverness tears but I do think that it's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.460 
inverness tears but I do think that it's
important<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> state<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.599> this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.019> kind<00:02:07.440> of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
important to state that this is kind of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.070 
important to state that this is kind of
Crichton's<00:02:07.950> take<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.489> need<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:08.819> speed<00:02:09.080> which

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
Crichton's take on need for speed which

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
Crichton's take on need for speed which
will<00:02:10.259> mean<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> couple<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.009> things<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.550> will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
will mean a couple of things it will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
will mean a couple of things it will
mean<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.780> an<00:02:12.930> arcade<00:02:13.140> action

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
mean that it's it's an arcade action

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.330 
mean that it's it's an arcade action
experience<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.510> will<00:02:15.720> mean<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
experience it will mean that it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 
experience it will mean that it's
beautiful<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> relatively

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
beautiful and and but it's relatively

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.770 
beautiful and and but it's relatively
easy<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.250> pick<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.610> play<00:02:20.819> which<00:02:21.599> i<00:02:21.720> think

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
easy to pick up and play which i think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.220 
easy to pick up and play which i think
is<00:02:22.019> key<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.769> lot<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.010> consumers<00:02:23.250> today<00:02:23.519> and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
is key to a lot of consumers today and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
is key to a lot of consumers today and
obviously<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.470> both<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.950> top<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.340> NEPA

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
obviously then both on top of that NEPA

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790 
obviously then both on top of that NEPA

game and and then on top of that auto
log<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.780> then<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> relatively

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890 
log and then you have a relatively
interesting<00:02:37.860> package<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.489> think<00:02:38.700> okay<00:02:39.629> also

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
interesting package I think okay also

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.530 
interesting package I think okay also

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
a bit about it well it's idea that they

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.910 
a bit about it well it's idea that they
came<00:02:45.209> from<00:02:45.269> Crichton<00:02:45.810> where<00:02:46.050> they<00:02:46.200> they

today<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:45.690> starts<00:03:46.019> by<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.440> erasers<00:03:47.129> going

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
today it starts by the erasers going

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.030 
today it starts by the erasers going
away<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.299> cops<00:03:48.629> chasing<00:03:49.019> them<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
away and the cops chasing them and the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.160 
away and the cops chasing them and the
racists<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.700> point<00:03:51.180> A<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.359> point<00:03:51.540> B<00:03:51.810> race

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
racists have a point A to point B race

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.869 
racists have a point A to point B race
where<00:03:52.470> they<00:03:52.560> need<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.799> reach<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.489> finish<00:03:53.609> line

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
where they need to reach the finish line

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.400 
where they need to reach the finish line
before<00:03:54.000> they<00:03:54.299> get<00:03:54.420> busted<00:03:54.780> basically<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
before they get busted basically and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.309 
before they get busted basically and
then<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:56.430> cops<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:57.359> have<00:03:57.569> an<00:03:57.780> arsenal<00:03:58.019> of

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
then the cops will have an arsenal of

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.259 
then the cops will have an arsenal of
weapons<00:03:58.709> at<00:03:59.010> their<00:03:59.160> disposal<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.849> take<00:04:00.060> out

weapons at their disposal to take out
the<00:04:00.630> racers<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.500> races<00:04:01.829> can<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.519> some

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the racers and the races can have some

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.580 
the racers and the races can have some
countermeasures<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.750> forms<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.290> weapons

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
countermeasures to in forms of weapons

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.400 
countermeasures to in forms of weapons
the<00:04:05.310> weapons<00:04:05.549> are<00:04:05.639> like<00:04:05.730> spike<00:04:06.120> strips<00:04:06.569> MPs

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
the weapons are like spike strips MPs

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
you use them and and and as a racer it's

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.150 
you use them and and and as a racer it's
it's<00:04:51.780> all<00:04:51.960> about<00:04:52.169> making<00:04:52.620> sure<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.070> you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
it's all about making sure that you

avoid the cops and flee okay so you're

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.710

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.600 
pursuit what we have is is maybe a
slightly<00:05:27.569> different<00:05:27.930> offering<00:05:28.499> we<00:05:29.430> have

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
slightly different offering we have

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.129 
slightly different offering we have
something<00:05:30.119> that<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.300> think<00:05:30.449> pushes<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
something that I think pushes the

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.510 
something that I think pushes the
boundaries<00:05:31.439> of<00:05:31.680> what<00:05:31.860> driving<00:05:32.069> games<00:05:32.339> are

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
boundaries of what driving games are

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.639 
boundaries of what driving games are
done<00:05:32.639> in<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.759> past<00:05:32.939> we<00:05:33.360> have<00:05:33.569> with<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.259> social

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:34.649

network<00:05:35.009> as<00:05:35.219> the<00:05:35.370> hub<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:36.240> obviously<00:05:36.599> a

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
network as the hub and obviously a

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.629 
network as the hub and obviously a
beautiful<00:05:37.409> game<00:05:37.589> with<00:05:37.919> where<00:05:38.219> you<00:05:38.309> can<00:05:38.460> play

beautiful game with where you can play
both<00:05:39.089> racers<00:05:39.719> and<00:05:39.899> corpse<00:05:40.169> which<00:05:40.379> i<00:05:40.499> think<00:05:40.559> is

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
both racers and corpse which i think is

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.429 
both racers and corpse which i think is
