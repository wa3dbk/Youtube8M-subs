scotch tape on the UP button or the up
joystick<00:01:01.680> function<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> come<00:01:03.149> back<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> few

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
joystick function and come back a few

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170 
joystick function and come back a few
days<00:01:03.899> later<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.070> amazing<00:01:05.700> giant

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
days later and have this amazing giant

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810

now<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.960> game<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.290> never<00:01:10.409> actually

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
now this game was never actually

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
now this game was never actually
released<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.700> doesn't<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.420> sense<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> me

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
released which doesn't make sense to me

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
released which doesn't make sense to me
because<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> quality<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.640> can't

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
because this is a quality game I can't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
because this is a quality game I can't
see<00:01:15.210> why<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.990> guess<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.979> might<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.280> been

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
see why I guess it might have been

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
see why I guess it might have been
construed<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.909> racist<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.200> pixel

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
construed as racist because your pixel

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
construed as racist because your pixel
is<00:01:19.740> black<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.490> constantly<00:01:20.970> getting<00:01:21.119> run

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
is black and it's constantly getting run

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.230 
is black and it's constantly getting run
over<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.780> cars<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.250> fragile<00:01:26.640> ah

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
over by cars so the the fragile ah

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
over by cars so the the fragile ah
racial<00:01:28.200> ecosystem<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.390> early<00:01:31.079> 80s

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
racial ecosystem of of the early 80s

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
racial ecosystem of of the early 80s
probably<00:01:31.920> couldn't<00:01:32.369> handle<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:32.880> something

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
probably couldn't handle or something

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.770 
probably couldn't handle or something
like<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.159> give<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.310> game<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> solid<00:01:36.420> 10

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
