hey I'm mr. P this is a new series that
I'm<00:00:06.870> gonna<00:00:07.080> call<00:00:07.319> drawing<00:00:08.189> with<00:00:08.370> simple

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
I'm gonna call drawing with simple

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.780 
I'm gonna call drawing with simple
shapes<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.389> simple<00:00:09.929> lines<00:00:10.170> now<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
shapes and simple lines now what do I

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.560 
shapes and simple lines now what do I
mean<00:00:11.820> by<00:00:12.030> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
mean by that

mean by that
drawing<00:00:12.809> with<00:00:12.929> simple<00:00:13.349> shapes<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.740> simple

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
drawing with simple shapes and simple

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.609 
drawing with simple shapes and simple
lines<00:00:14.219> well<00:00:14.820> that's<00:00:15.000> easy<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:16.440> that

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
lines well that's easy I think that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.010 
lines well that's easy I think that
everything<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.910> can<00:00:18.090> draw<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.900> be

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
everything that you can draw can be

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.509 
everything that you can draw can be
broken<00:00:19.260> down<00:00:19.500> into<00:00:19.920> four<00:00:20.400> main<00:00:21.359> shapes<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
broken down into four main shapes and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:31.999 
broken down into four main shapes and
using<00:00:23.519> four<00:00:23.820> main<00:00:24.420> lines<00:00:30.590> what<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.800> going

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
using four main lines what are we going

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.150 
using four main lines what are we going
to<00:00:32.130> draw<00:00:32.340> today

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
to draw today

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.299 
to draw today

we're going to use guy dots now these
dots<00:01:09.229> help<00:01:10.070> me<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:11.060> put<00:01:11.330> lines<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.200> correct

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
dots help me to put lines in the correct

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.640 
dots help me to put lines in the correct
spots<00:01:13.250> let<00:01:13.790> me<00:01:13.880> show<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.090> what<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.330> mean<00:01:14.650> one

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
guy got a top one a pot like that one

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.060 
guy got a top one a pot like that one
guy<00:01:20.479> got<00:01:21.050> below<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:22.190> watch<00:01:22.369> how<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.820> works

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
guy got below now watch how this works

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.930 
guy got below now watch how this works
starting<00:01:25.070> at<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.369> guy<00:01:25.610> dot<00:01:27.670> draw<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> line

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
starting at that guy dot draw a line

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.960 
starting at that guy dot draw a line
straight<00:01:29.330> down<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.320> end<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.280> then<00:01:31.340> we're

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
straight down to that end and then we're

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.940 
straight down to that end and then we're
gonna<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.210> another<00:01:32.450> one<00:01:35.380> straight<00:01:36.380> down<00:01:36.679> to

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
gonna do another one straight down to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.820 
gonna do another one straight down to
that<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.729> makes<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.259> triangle<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.679> then

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
that and that makes a triangle and then

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.410 
that and that makes a triangle and then
like<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.009> triangle<00:01:40.250> sure<00:01:40.940> does

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
like a triangle sure does

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.899 
like a triangle sure does
let's<00:01:41.720> do<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> number<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:42.670> starting<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.759> back

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
let's do a number one starting it back

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.370 
let's do a number one starting it back
down<00:01:45.340> all<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.610> way<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.030> iam<00:01:47.300> now<00:01:47.780> this

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
down all the way to that iam now this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.520 
down all the way to that iam now this
next<00:01:48.740> line<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.940> not<00:01:50.060> gonna<00:01:50.509> quite<00:01:51.020> make<00:01:51.500> it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
next line it's not gonna quite make it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.999 
next line it's not gonna quite make it
to<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.979> end<00:01:52.750> it's<00:01:53.750> gonna<00:01:53.929> stop<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.649> little

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
to the end it's gonna stop a little

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.460 
to the end it's gonna stop a little
short<00:01:55.429> of<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.819> end<00:01:55.850> maybe<00:01:56.300> about<00:01:56.600> right<00:01:56.659> there

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
short of the end maybe about right there

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.169 
short of the end maybe about right there
let's<00:01:57.890> put<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> dot<00:01:58.490> right<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:58.789> too<00:02:00.670> okay<00:02:01.700> now

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
let's put a dot right there too okay now

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.050 
let's put a dot right there too okay now
that<00:02:02.330> tells<00:02:02.659> me<00:02:02.899> where<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.140> line<00:02:03.500> even<00:02:04.060> it's

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that tells me where the line even it's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.960 
that tells me where the line even it's
gonna<00:02:05.330> always<00:02:05.569> begin<00:02:06.289> right<00:02:07.009> here<00:02:09.459> okay<00:02:10.459> now

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
gonna always begin right here okay now

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.810 
gonna always begin right here okay now
that's<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.780> beak<00:02:12.019> now<00:02:12.680> we<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:13.160> add<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.549> little

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's the beak now we can add a little

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.069 
that's the beak now we can add a little
detailed<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.450> there<00:02:14.600> right<00:02:14.810> quick
