00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.550 

nice<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.080> rusty<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.440> there

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.720 

you<00:00:20.560> know<00:00:20.650> there<00:00:20.860> are<00:00:21.100> outer<00:00:21.520> water<00:00:21.820> seals

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.870 

in<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.300> compression<00:00:29.690> sealed

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
in the compression sealed

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.380 
in the compression sealed
the<00:00:31.940> shooting

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the shooting

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.570 
the shooting
just<00:00:33.899> take<00:00:34.050> him<00:00:34.230> out

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
just take him out

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.160 
just take him out
that's<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.270> forms<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.810> basis<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that's what forms the basis of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.490 
that's what forms the basis of
essentially<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.680> head<00:00:37.830> gasket<00:00:39.290> that's<00:00:40.290> all

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
essentially a head gasket that's all

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.220 
essentially a head gasket that's all
they<00:00:40.650> are

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.540 

these<00:00:50.829> are<00:00:51.010> oil<00:00:51.160> rings<00:00:51.460> here

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
these are oil rings here

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
these are oil rings here
so<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> rotary<00:00:54.330> essentially<00:00:54.780> drives<00:00:55.050> around

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so the rotary essentially drives around

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.790 
so the rotary essentially drives around
the<00:00:55.980> e<00:00:56.010> shaft<00:00:56.780> in<00:00:57.780> an<00:00:58.200> elliptical<00:00:58.440> motion

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the e shaft in an elliptical motion

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.440 
the e shaft in an elliptical motion
inside<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.940> housing

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.969 

this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.110> seals<00:01:07.500> fly

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this is where all the seals fly

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.060 
this is where all the seals fly
everywhere

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.300 

I<00:01:15.130> don't<00:01:15.730> believe<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.060> that

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.200 

and<00:01:21.549> there<00:01:21.700> were<00:01:21.880> sounds<00:01:22.030> out

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.620 

but<00:01:26.570> using<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> sliding<00:01:27.320> screw<00:01:28.240> screw<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.390> slide

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
but using a sliding screw screw in slide

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:53.859 
but using a sliding screw screw in slide
number

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.310 

you<00:01:54.380> like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
you like

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.800 
you like
that's<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.740> first<00:01:56.950> housing<00:01:57.430> of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
that's the first housing of

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.719 
that's the first housing of
and<00:01:59.140> again<00:01:59.430> after<00:02:00.430> WaterSeal

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.790 

in<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.939> compression<00:02:08.330> seal

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.860 

and<00:02:12.100> again<00:02:12.340> there<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.210> each<00:02:13.330> section<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
and again there on each section of the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.590 
and again there on each section of the
right<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.200> know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.780 

so<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.050> see<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:19.310> quite<00:02:19.580> messy<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:20.150> there

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.760 

just<00:02:27.420> place<00:02:27.629> that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
just place that

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.890 
just place that
well<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.250> now

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.850 

clearly<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.620> surgeons<00:02:37.010> have<00:02:37.160> Co<00:02:37.430> Phelan

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
clearly the surgeons have Co Phelan

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:50.190 
clearly the surgeons have Co Phelan
and<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.670> now<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:40.940> curry

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.740 

organization<00:02:50.890> or<00:02:51.010> something

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:09.559 

Gallery<00:03:00.750> robot

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:04:11.550 

let's<00:03:10.260> go<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> mid

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.910 

you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:12.680> see<00:04:12.860> here<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.280> sense<00:04:13.490> of<00:04:13.610> play

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
you can see here on the sense of play

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.750 
you can see here on the sense of play
is<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.610> intake<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:15.970> exhaust<00:04:16.209> ports

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
is the intake and exhaust ports

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.750 
is the intake and exhaust ports
essentially<00:04:18.760> this<00:04:18.880> forms<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.359> fireface<00:04:20.760> so

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
essentially this forms the fireface so

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.780 
essentially this forms the fireface so
if<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.970> rotor<00:04:22.180> passes<00:04:22.810> down<00:04:22.990> over<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.440> port

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
if the rotor passes down over the port

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.000 
if the rotor passes down over the port
it<00:04:24.790> opens<00:04:25.150> up<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.389> pore<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.840> that's<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> same

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
it opens up the pore and that's the same

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.000 
it opens up the pore and that's the same
as<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.250> valve<00:04:28.090> opening<00:04:31.710> position<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.830> these

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
as a valve opening position of these

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:47.820 
as a valve opening position of these
brands<00:04:33.940> here<00:04:34.360> gives<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.990> your<00:04:35.110> timing

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:05:57.610 

three<00:04:48.830> sorts<00:04:49.160> it

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:10.209 

humans

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.929 

infamous<00:06:10.729> apex<00:06:11.149> seal<00:06:12.399> they<00:06:13.399> sit<00:06:13.729> in<00:06:13.849> the

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939 
infamous apex seal they sit in the

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:20.439 
infamous apex seal they sit in the
corner<00:06:14.209> of<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.360> rotor<00:06:15.999> what<00:06:16.999> form<00:06:19.089> the<00:06:20.089> basis

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
corner of the rotor what form the basis

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:51.580 
corner of the rotor what form the basis
of<00:06:20.539> the<00:06:20.599> piston<00:06:21.229> ring

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.429 

a<00:06:52.060> phone

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:57.439 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:02.630 

see<00:06:58.009> the<00:06:58.099> myself<00:06:58.429> okay<00:06:58.669> sorry<00:06:59.179> to<00:06:59.300> be<00:06:59.389> honest

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.000 

he's<00:07:03.640> on<00:07:03.790> that<00:07:03.880> first<00:07:04.120> router<00:07:04.650> these<00:07:05.650> these

he's on that first router these these

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:15.230 
he's on that first router these these
sales<00:07:06.280> have<00:07:06.490> more<00:07:06.790> interest<00:07:07.630> on

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.559 

well<00:07:16.240> that's<00:07:16.389> it<00:07:16.809> one<00:07:17.800> rotary<00:07:18.219> engine<00:07:18.569> miss

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:19.569 
well that's it one rotary engine miss

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.839 
well that's it one rotary engine miss
trips
