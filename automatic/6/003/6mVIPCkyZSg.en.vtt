00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
farm side the second thing we did is we

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.459 
farm side the second thing we did is we
reworked<00:00:47.980> severs<00:00:48.399> w<00:00:48.910> ricochet<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:50.140> instead

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
reworked severs w ricochet now instead

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.990 
reworked severs w ricochet now instead
of<00:00:50.530> being<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.829> toggle<00:00:51.070> that<00:00:51.280> drains<00:00:51.550> mana<00:00:51.789> on

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
of being a toggle that drains mana on

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880 
of being a toggle that drains mana on
each<00:00:52.120> attack<00:00:52.449> it's<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.930> non<00:00:53.109> next<00:00:53.469> hit<00:00:53.590> effect

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
each attack it's a non next hit effect

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.340 
each attack it's a non next hit effect
like<00:00:54.039> NASA's<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.699> siphon<00:00:55.149> strike<00:00:55.570> this<00:00:56.170> will

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
like NASA's a siphon strike this will

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.380 
like NASA's a siphon strike this will
let<00:00:56.500> her<00:00:56.680> do<00:00:56.949> kind<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.579> double<00:00:57.879> attack<00:00:58.120> thing

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
let her do kind of a double attack thing

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.970 
let her do kind of a double attack thing
like<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.690> see<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.050> other<00:00:59.260> on<00:00:59.500> next<00:00:59.859> hit

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
like we see with other on next hit

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.740 
like we see with other on next hit
effects<00:01:00.280> which<00:01:00.699> improves<00:01:01.269> their<00:01:01.359> ability<00:01:01.719> to

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
effects which improves their ability to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.299 
effects which improves their ability to
skirmish<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.440> kind<00:01:02.649> of<00:01:02.739> play<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.129> lane

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
skirmish and kind of play in the lane

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.120 
skirmish and kind of play in the lane
when<00:01:03.760> there's<00:01:03.940> fewer<00:01:04.210> than<00:01:04.390> five<00:01:04.600> targets

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
when there's fewer than five targets

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.980 
when there's fewer than five targets
finally<00:01:06.130> we've<00:01:06.250> changed<00:01:06.490> servers<00:01:06.790> passive<00:01:07.390> as

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
finally we've changed servers passive as

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.720 
finally we've changed servers passive as

now<00:01:10.030> gives<00:01:10.330> bonus<00:01:10.780> move<00:01:10.960> speed<00:01:11.200> when<00:01:11.350> you

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
now gives bonus move speed when you

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.499 
now gives bonus move speed when you

because<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.290> some<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.560> jungle<00:03:21.800> changes<00:03:22.220> we

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
because of some of the jungle changes we

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.100 
because of some of the jungle changes we
did<00:03:22.520> health<00:03:23.120> potions<00:03:23.480> are<00:03:23.600> much<00:03:23.630> less

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
did health potions are much less

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.540 
did health potions are much less
required<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.710> junglers<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.250> successful

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
required for junglers to be successful

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.250 
required for junglers to be successful
there<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.180> felt<00:03:26.360> we<00:03:26.540> had<00:03:26.570> some<00:03:26.840> room<00:03:27.020> to<00:03:27.050> go

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
there so we felt we had some room to go

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.990 
there so we felt we had some room to go
ahead<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.530> adjust<00:03:27.710> these<00:03:27.860> numbers<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
ahead and adjust these numbers now the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.090 
ahead and adjust these numbers now the
reason<00:03:29.270> we<00:03:29.360> wanted<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.660> do<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.080> was<00:03:30.380> people

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
reason we wanted to do so was people

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.380 
reason we wanted to do so was people
were<00:03:31.190> being<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.490> little<00:03:31.520> too<00:03:31.820> hard<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.120> kill<00:03:32.300> in

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
were being a little too hard to kill in

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.870 
were being a little too hard to kill in

low percentage on melee characters the
reason<00:03:42.980> we<00:03:43.070> did<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.520> in<00:03:43.730> light<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:43.970> some

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
reason we did this is in light of some

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.940 
reason we did this is in light of some
of<00:03:44.450> these<00:03:44.570> lane<00:03:44.900> changes<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.560> make<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.830> so
