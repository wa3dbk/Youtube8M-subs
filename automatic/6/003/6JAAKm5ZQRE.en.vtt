you to that link that or the it'll

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.220 
you to that link that or the it'll
decode<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.829> QR<00:02:20.129> code<00:02:20.370> um<00:02:20.609> if<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.659> drag<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.109> on

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
decode the QR code um if you drag it on

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.580 
decode the QR code um if you drag it on
so<00:02:22.950> uh<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:24.150> could<00:02:24.359> let's<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.409> make

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so uh you could let's go and make

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.209 
so uh you could let's go and make
another<00:02:26.159> QR<00:02:26.849> code<00:02:27.120> um<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.889> the<00:02:28.980> sake<00:02:29.189> of

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
another QR code um so in for the sake of

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.720 
another QR code um so in for the sake of
this<00:02:29.489> video<00:02:30.650> let's<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:32.069> put<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.549> for

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this video let's just put it up for

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.520 
this video let's just put it up for
number<00:02:32.909> like<00:02:33.180> let's<00:02:33.359> say<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.629> want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> make<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
number like let's say we want to make it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.319 
number like let's say we want to make it
plus<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.430> um<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.980> random<00:02:38.159> one<00:02:38.519> it's

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
plus one um it's just a random one it's

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.300 
plus one um it's just a random one it's
not<00:02:39.510> mine<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.049> mean<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.500> guess<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.739> could<00:02:40.889> try<00:02:41.159> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
not mine I mean I guess you could try it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.239 
not mine I mean I guess you could try it
but<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:42.000> totally<00:02:42.540> made<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.079> so<00:02:43.290> click<00:02:44.099> on

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.249 
but I totally made it up so click on

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.949 
but I totally made it up so click on
create'<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:44.909> can<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.450> even<00:02:45.599> it

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
create' and you can see that it even it

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.649 
create' and you can see that it even it
you<00:02:46.439> know<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.129> changes<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.760> QR<00:02:48.090> code<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.419> we'll

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
you know it changes the QR code so we'll

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.879 
you know it changes the QR code so we'll
go<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.959> save<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.790> again<00:02:50.790> we'll<00:02:50.969> make<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.180> be

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
go and save that again we'll make it be

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.990 
go and save that again we'll make it be
so<00:02:52.909> desktop<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.209> save<00:02:55.280> okay<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.639> shows<00:02:56.819> up

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
so desktop and save okay so it shows up

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.640 
so desktop and save okay so it shows up
on<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> desktop<00:02:57.510> again<00:02:57.989> let's<00:02:58.199> go<00:02:58.349> ahead<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
on a desktop again let's go ahead and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.369 
on a desktop again let's go ahead and
drag<00:02:58.919> it<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.189> and<00:02:59.459> it<00:03:00.299> takes<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.900> decoded

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
drag it on and it takes the decoded

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.899 
drag it on and it takes the decoded
result<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:01.919> it<00:03:01.980> puts<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.189> into<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> small<00:03:02.699> box

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
result and it puts it into a small box

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.839 
result and it puts it into a small box

stuff so um you could also make um you
could<00:03:11.219> also<00:03:11.370> take<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.969> contact<00:03:12.629> from<00:03:12.719> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
could also take a contact from the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.679 
could also take a contact from the
address<00:03:13.230> book<00:03:13.469> and<00:03:13.819> make<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:14.969> into<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.329> QR

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
address book and make that into a QR

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.539 
address book and make that into a QR
code<00:03:15.719> over<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.889> could<00:03:17.040> also<00:03:17.129> choose

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
code over here you could also choose

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.159 
code over here you could also choose
what<00:03:17.759> type<00:03:17.879> of<00:03:17.939> QR<00:03:18.269> code<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.689> want<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.109> you

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
what type of QR code you want so you

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.140 
what type of QR code you want so you
have<00:03:19.379> to<00:03:19.530> our<00:03:19.709> code<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> quick<00:03:20.819> code

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
have to our code you have the quick code

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.270 
have to our code you have the quick code
and<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.599> have<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> data<00:03:21.989> matrix<00:03:22.199> so<00:03:23.129> we're

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and you have the data matrix so we're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.099 
and you have the data matrix so we're
going<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.639> click<00:03:23.819> on<00:03:23.939> quick<00:03:24.299> code<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:24.959> can

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
going to click on quick code and we can

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.509 
going to click on quick code and we can
see<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.409> this<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.769> what<00:03:26.009> the<00:03:26.129> code<00:03:26.340> would

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
see that this is what the code would

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.199 
see that this is what the code would
look<00:03:26.579> like<00:03:26.909> um<00:03:27.859> in<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:29.009> quick<00:03:29.280> code<00:03:29.519> format<00:03:30.000> so

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
look like um in a quick code format so

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.699 
look like um in a quick code format so
let's<00:03:30.239> make<00:03:30.479> that<00:03:30.509> seeing<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.290> we'll<00:03:31.560> go

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
let's make that seeing and we'll go

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.890 
let's make that seeing and we'll go
ahead<00:03:31.919> and<00:03:32.159> save<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.939> again<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.419> we<00:03:33.479> can<00:03:33.659> see

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
ahead and save it again and we can see

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.159 
ahead and save it again and we can see
that<00:03:34.259> it<00:03:34.799> picks<00:03:35.189> up<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.669> code<00:03:36.120> um<00:03:38.840> no<00:03:39.840> that's<00:03:40.019> a

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
that it picks up the code um no that's a

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.949 
that it picks up the code um no that's a
bug<00:03:40.349> uh-huh<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.849> doesn't<00:03:42.180> pick<00:03:42.299> up<00:03:42.389> medium

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
bug uh-huh so it doesn't pick up medium

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.429 
bug uh-huh so it doesn't pick up medium
quick<00:03:43.949> code<00:03:44.220> um<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:45.239> they'll<00:03:45.689> fix<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.259> a

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
quick code um but they'll fix that in a

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.879 
quick code um but they'll fix that in a
math<00:03:47.220> coming<00:03:47.489> update<00:03:47.939> um<00:03:48.329> they<00:03:49.259> even<00:03:49.500> told<00:03:49.709> me

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
math coming update um they even told me

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.890 
math coming update um they even told me
in<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.069> email<00:03:50.189> that<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.549> app<00:03:50.819> still<00:03:51.419> had<00:03:51.659> bugs

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
in the email that the app still had bugs

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.619 
in the email that the app still had bugs
in<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.729> make<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.150> types<00:03:54.389> of

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
in it so you can make it all types of

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.050 
in it so you can make it all types of
different<00:03:54.840> codes<00:03:55.549> you're<00:03:56.549> making<00:03:56.790> data

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
different codes you're making data

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.969 
different codes you're making data
matrix<00:03:57.299> let's<00:03:57.719> see<00:03:57.840> what<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.109> looks<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.469> so

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
matrix let's see what that looks like so

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.670 
matrix let's see what that looks like so
making<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.459> text<00:03:59.759> box<00:03:59.909> like<00:04:00.239> eight<00:04:00.479> and<00:04:00.750> then

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
making a text box like eight and then

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.240 
making a text box like eight and then
save<00:04:02.189> I<00:04:02.669> mean<00:04:03.030> Oh<00:04:03.150> create<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.259> you<00:04:04.979> can<00:04:05.099> see

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
save I mean Oh create it and you can see

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.990 
save I mean Oh create it and you can see
that's<00:04:05.400> very<00:04:05.609> small<00:04:05.879> um<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> as<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.759> showed<00:04:08.969> you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
that's very small um so as I showed you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.420 
that's very small um so as I showed you
it's<00:04:09.329> also<00:04:09.509> a<00:04:09.719> scanner<00:04:10.229> you<00:04:10.349> could<00:04:11.039> um<00:04:11.189> you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's also a scanner you could um you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.029 
it's also a scanner you could um you
could<00:04:11.609> drag<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.150> codes<00:04:12.509> onto<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.229> so<00:04:13.859> over

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:14.039 
could drag the codes onto it so over

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.270 
could drag the codes onto it so over
here<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.819> um<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.539> custom<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:16.440> QR<00:04:16.799> code<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:17.250> I

ah so let's try that even yeah okay so
back<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.779> the<00:05:37.500> QR<00:05:37.889> code<00:05:38.099> that<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.430> made<00:05:38.669> we're

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
back to the QR code that I made we're

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.829 
back to the QR code that I made we're
just<00:05:39.569> going<00:05:39.779> to<00:05:39.839> go<00:05:40.050> ahead<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:40.379> drag<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:40.979> to

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
just going to go ahead and drag it on to

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.170 
just going to go ahead and drag it on to
the<00:05:42.839> dock<00:05:43.139> or<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.649> application<00:05:44.430> itself<00:05:44.699> quick

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180
