00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.520 
look at successful children successful
families<00:01:43.940> they<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.870> they<00:01:44.990> do<00:01:45.050> all<00:01:45.380> this

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
families they see that they do all this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.380 
families they see that they do all this
stuff<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:46.130> they<00:01:46.280> go<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.550> museums<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.330> they

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
stuff like they go to museums and they

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.180 
stuff like they go to museums and they
have<00:01:47.540> all<00:01:47.690> these<00:01:47.840> books<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.350> their<00:01:48.500> homes<00:01:48.740> also

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
have all these books in their homes also

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.890 
have all these books in their homes also
but<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.790> turns<00:01:50.000> out<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.330> those<00:01:50.630> are<00:01:50.870> not

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
but it turns out that those are not

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800 
but it turns out that those are not
causal<00:01:51.590> elements<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:53.120> having<00:01:53.540> all<00:01:53.660> those

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
causal elements that having all those

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.230 
causal elements that having all those
books<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.410> going<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.920> museums<00:01:55.340> those<00:01:56.030> are

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
books and going to the museums those are

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.910 
books and going to the museums those are
the<00:01:56.330> things<00:01:56.510> that<00:01:56.690> people<00:01:56.960> who<00:01:57.500> are

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the things that people who are

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.100 
the things that people who are
accomplished<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.940> life<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.540> are<00:01:59.660> smart<00:01:59.990> maybe

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
accomplished in life and are smart maybe

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.330 
accomplished in life and are smart maybe
even<00:02:00.500> make<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.680> lot<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.890> money<00:02:01.010> are<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> little

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
even make a lot of money are a little

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
even make a lot of money are a little
bit<00:02:01.520> more<00:02:01.670> likely<00:02:01.910> to<00:02:02.210> do<00:02:02.470> but<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.650> there's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
bit more likely to do but then there's

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.260 
bit more likely to do but then there's
this<00:02:03.950> idea<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.430> if<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.670> do<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.060> for

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
this idea that if you do all that for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.820 
this idea that if you do all that for
your<00:02:05.390> kid<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.660> will<00:02:05.750> make<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.200> happen<00:02:06.350> like

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
your kid it will make it happen like

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.109 
your kid it will make it happen like
it's<00:02:06.980> some<00:02:07.160> medicine<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.760> can<00:02:07.940> give

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's some medicine that you can give

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.240 
it's some medicine that you can give
them<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.479> will<00:02:08.599> turn<00:02:08.780> into<00:02:08.959> magic<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.769> it

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
them and it will turn into magic and it

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.559 
them and it will turn into magic and it
just<00:02:10.459> doesn't<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.090> doesn't<00:02:11.180> work<00:02:11.510> that

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
just doesn't it just doesn't work that

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.610 
just doesn't it just doesn't work that
way<00:02:11.930> sorry

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
way sorry

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.979 
way sorry
yeah<00:02:13.459> I'd<00:02:13.730> say<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.150> data<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.629> we've<00:02:14.780> looked

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
yeah I'd say the data that we've looked

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.410 
yeah I'd say the data that we've looked
at<00:02:15.260> suggests<00:02:16.189> that<00:02:16.370> by<00:02:16.969> the<00:02:17.030> time<00:02:17.329> you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
at suggests that by the time you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
at suggests that by the time you
actually<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> kid<00:02:18.290> most<00:02:19.129> of<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
actually have a kid most of the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.870 
actually have a kid most of the
choices<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.980> make<00:02:20.130> it'll<00:02:20.460> make<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> good

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
choices you make it'll make you a good

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.090 
choices you make it'll make you a good

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
parent you've already made them so it's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.790 
parent you've already made them so it's
not<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.970> taking<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> kids<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.350> museums

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
than more than the more to learn for a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.450 
than more than the more to learn for a
young<00:02:34.230> kid<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> grocery<00:02:34.980> store<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.310> a

know<00:02:46.680> interested<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:48.510> know<00:02:48.630> interested

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
know interested and you know interested

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.230 
know interested and you know interested
in<00:02:49.380> life<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.040> specifics<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.120> with

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
in life and the specifics you do with

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.510 
in life and the specifics you do with
your<00:02:51.360> kids<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:52.050> doesn't<00:02:52.260> matter<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> do

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
your kids it doesn't matter what you do

your kids it doesn't matter what you do
then<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.450> think<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.630> matters<00:02:54.720> whether

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
then I don't think it matters whether

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.840 
then I don't think it matters whether
you<00:02:55.080> read<00:02:55.350> your<00:02:55.590> kid<00:02:55.800> play<00:02:56.400> rock<00:02:56.670> paper

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.370 
you read your kid play rock paper
scissors<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.480> kid<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.960> think<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.260> has

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
scissors with your kid I think it has

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the same effect more or less in the long

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.270 
the same effect more or less in the long
run<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.230> my<00:03:01.410> own<00:03:01.500> view<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.740> parent<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.040> every

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
run and in my own view a parent is every

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.860 
run and in my own view a parent is every
kid's<00:03:02.490> can<00:03:02.640> learn<00:03:02.790> how<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.910> read<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.450> every

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
kid's gonna learn how to do math but not

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.040 
kid's gonna learn how to do math but not
that<00:03:06.150> many<00:03:06.300> kids<00:03:06.360> are<00:03:06.600> gonna<00:03:06.690> learn<00:03:06.840> how<00:03:07.020> to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
that many kids are gonna learn how to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.200 
that many kids are gonna learn how to
think<00:03:07.440> how<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> be<00:03:07.920> creative<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> think

think how to be creative and so I think
the<00:03:09.690> key<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.350> being<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.860> great<00:03:10.980> parent<00:03:11.220> is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550

the stuff that some people seem to know
how<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:16.170> lots<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> others<00:03:16.770> don't
