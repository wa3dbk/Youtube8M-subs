00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
line I mean it could be because the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
line I mean it could be because the
weeds<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.430> abrasive<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:42.300> could<00:00:42.510> because

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
weeds are abrasive or could because

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.720 
weeds are abrasive or could because
they're<00:00:42.870> zebra<00:00:43.170> muscles<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> weeds<00:00:43.890> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
oh you've heard me say a ton of times

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
oh you've heard me say a ton of times

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
not to avoid the wind

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
not to avoid the wind
you'll<00:01:20.880> fish<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.840> turn

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you'll fish in it because it can turn

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
stand up bang around all day long but
one<00:01:27.510> rule<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.160> not

one rule that I have is if you're not

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.610 
one rule that I have is if you're not
effectively<00:01:29.910> fishing<00:01:30.420> move<00:01:30.870> along<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.410> not

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
effectively fishing move along I'm not

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.800 
effectively fishing move along I'm not
being<00:01:31.950> able<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.790> weed<00:01:33.000> line<00:01:33.240> properly

of the weed clumps so probably make

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the weed clumps so probably make

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
sense in this situation to find some

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.380 
sense in this situation to find some
