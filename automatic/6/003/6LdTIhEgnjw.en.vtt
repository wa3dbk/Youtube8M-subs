00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 my in today's video we want 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.640
 us with the attribute on days table 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.109
 employ 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.010
 I'm aware that this is me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.050
 probably not gone anymore 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.389
 but I have said that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
 this theme really nice supple 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.960
 could be on all hire there 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.310
 some aspects of knowledge that we have in the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.820
 to incorporate normal play 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.590
 can 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.830
 and before that come here a little one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.830
 appetizer 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.360
 All right, what does that mean? 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.760
 at target even if you translate that 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.670
 it would not have to sound like it 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.540
 but or not clickable and the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.430
 one or the other will become one 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.690
 probably asking is a target 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.280
 ebel not synonymous with the same 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.170
 invulnerable if he is nobody 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.960
 can click and I can only say 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.480
 no, because there are four distinctions 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.400
 For one, there is the complete and 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.710
 vulnerability then there is that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.930
 partial and vulnerability special 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.060
 Tesches and last but not least another 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.000
 damage invulnerability with it 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.660
 Last point least liked or 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
 most interesting is by using this one 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.110
 Right at the beginning 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.940
 And that's about it's champions 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500
 is the invulnerable opposite 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.990
 can do harm as for example 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.340
 cale hobby or founder more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.200
 but that's my opinion 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 interesting is we just go to that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.740
 very first point and indeed the complete 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.630
 invulnerability 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 by definition is only at the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890
 activation above all protected 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.320
 to a complete invulnerability 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 you have to get either 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.050
 solar glass will only pick this up 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.540
 that means you will not get them here 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.760
 nor the match up or euro by the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.680
 guardian angel and there you are during the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.510
 rebirth, too, especially 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.130
 this may be very banal 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.540
 Sound but your light can too 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.400
 not to be pushed around like to 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.960
 for example, by alister the only one 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.030
 champion capable of one 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.000
 to gain complete invulnerability 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.470
 is sharko because he can not just oldies 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 or other skills German 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.909
 but is also during activation 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.140
 completely invulnerable so actually 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.810
 no longer in the game 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.520
 because now comes the big but because if 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.350
 one word for him a ignite it and 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.119
 it's worth it afterwards 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 Original still burn 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.769
 but in the 05 seconds of the division has 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.690
 yes no harm get the same 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.700
 applies to the ability of fiddle sticks 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 if you turn it on live 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.840
 and then it is worthwhile then 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
 Then you suck the original life 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 but in the participation process itself 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.360
 you have done no harm 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.920
 the time span is of course very short 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 but you can do any skill like that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280
 prevent 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.650
 the next point is the partial 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 invulnerability that means there is here 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.489
 certain conditions where you anyway 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.890
 get hurt because you are to 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.290
 during activation protects and also 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.010
 no longer clickable but should be before that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.750
 someone a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.030
 ledgerwood times blog make it like 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.189
 example, a poison or some envy then 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.049
 you still get hurt but only 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.000
 if it was done before 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.909
 That means our candidates are this time 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.519
 fis leaf and left because if you are good 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.500
 Sharing you can dodge every word 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.860
 be it damage to the area by quarter 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.450
 multi or the classic fr 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.670
 but as already mentioned are damage 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.739
 overtimes fur but also lees like that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.109
 turn of fiddle sticks still in 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.909
 however, it is possible for you to hurt 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.310
 only if they have been previously activated 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.769
 because if you have been in dream pool mode for 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.810
 or on the dreizack then stands 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.609
 Can not you click this one 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.190
 condition still applies all 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.720
 But projects are intercepted well and 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.760
 the last point are the special ones 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.220
 Caches because protected with this page 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.859
 as long as you are almost moving or 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.870
 the ability to do it yourself, but also 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.670
 only the following condition and indeed 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.250
 you still get damage from damage 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.579
 overtime space or left it if you 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.139
 previously clicked because at the nation 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.419
 you can not even click on it 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.160
 that is the special and projectile 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.260
 also behave differently because 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.209
 if the enemy is about to move 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.250
 did you click and that 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.260
 politics is on the way 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.060
 after that, that means when you charge 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.190
 leaving you to someone going at it 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.230
 his position held firmly 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.180
 or whatever with project 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.889
 are definitely no space space 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.810
 common as the multi campus of the 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.090
 good example but who can? 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.060
 actually these special ashes ours 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.570
 Candidates this time are maike master jay 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.609
 z and fiore because mouse in a position 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.370
 fast to German if he is quasi 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.870
 holding on to it means that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.699
 he will not be for a short moment 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.680
 more clickable but also for surfaces 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.389
 spells no longer accessible to the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.159
 means first even in the situation the 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.620
 multi from kattus to german if you 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.820
 it really times because in this mode 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.380
 he is not only not clickable 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.659
 but also gets none 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.370
 area damage for master is exactly what applies 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.650
 same he can also do the card 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.400
 salty with his alfa strike easily 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.229
 german but if he had a damage before 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.360
 overtime spa or get a song off 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.039
 he still gets hurt and 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.780
 skills that had worked recently 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.920
 were charged later 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.650
 that often leads too much 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.810
 irritating situations but one becomes 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.700
 still tense or held or 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.139
 Anyway, good I hope you are 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.120
 a bit clearer the whole 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.230
 terms as I said 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.000
 have that with many subscribers 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.460
 tested and it was really interesting 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.380
 but also a bit irritating 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.970
 that means there is in this area 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.570
 still a lot to test and too 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.460
 try 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.340
 and if you want, you can do it all 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.060
 So just do it in and have fun 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.060
 at the German
