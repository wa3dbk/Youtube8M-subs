nil compared to the previous units that
we<00:04:49.240> used<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.020> we're<00:04:50.260> really<00:04:50.590> pleased<00:04:51.010> with<00:04:51.840> my

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
we used so we're really pleased with my

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.210 
we used so we're really pleased with my
veterinarian<00:04:53.350> and<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.620> walked<00:04:53.979> through<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
veterinarian and I walked through the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.070 
veterinarian and I walked through the
milk<00:04:54.400> barn<00:04:54.640> after<00:04:54.850> every<00:04:55.210> prec<00:04:55.419> check<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.930> we

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
milk barn after every prec check and we

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080 
milk barn after every prec check and we
just<00:04:56.289> look<00:04:56.680> at<00:04:56.800> tea<00:04:56.950> tins<00:04:57.160> and<00:04:57.460> judge<00:04:57.760> them<00:04:57.910> and

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
just look at tea tins and judge them and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.170 
just look at tea tins and judge them and
see<00:04:58.210> how<00:04:58.240> they're<00:04:58.450> going<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:59.490> we<00:05:00.490> since<00:05:00.970> using

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
see how they're going and we since using

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.520 
see how they're going and we since using
the<00:05:01.390> impulse<00:05:01.690> airliner<00:05:02.050> we've<00:05:02.229> noticed

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
the impulse airliner we've noticed

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.440 
the impulse airliner we've noticed
they've<00:05:02.680> gotten<00:05:03.010> better<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:04.090> tea<00:05:04.270> tins

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
they've gotten better and the tea tins

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.409 
they've gotten better and the tea tins
have<00:05:04.630> have<00:05:05.200> have<00:05:05.919> greatly<00:05:06.640> improved<00:05:06.910> here

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
have have have greatly improved here

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.870 
have have have greatly improved here
yeah<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.410> clusters<00:05:08.830> come<00:05:08.979> off<00:05:09.130> very<00:05:09.370> well<00:05:09.520> and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
yeah the clusters come off very well and

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.900 
yeah the clusters come off very well and
they're<00:05:10.690> nice<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.260> light<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.620> put<00:05:11.830> on<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.190> found

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
they're nice and light to put on I found

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.490 
they're nice and light to put on I found
the<00:05:13.090> clusters<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.570> we<00:05:13.750> had<00:05:13.930> before<00:05:14.080> heavy

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
the clusters that we had before heavy

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.440 
the clusters that we had before heavy
and<00:05:14.680> cumbersome<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.729> these<00:05:15.940> are<00:05:16.210> sort<00:05:16.419> of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
and cumbersome but these are sort of

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.960 
and cumbersome but these are sort of
very<00:05:16.630> springy<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.289> light<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.770> I'm<00:05:18.490> sure<00:05:18.940> the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
very springy and light and I'm sure the

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.610 
very springy and light and I'm sure the
heifers<00:05:19.450> take<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.810> them<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:20.020> lot<00:05:20.140> better<00:05:20.380> than

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
heifers take to them a lot better than

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.399 
heifers take to them a lot better than
they<00:05:20.830> used<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.430> take<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.850> older<00:05:22.180> ones

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
they used to take to the older ones

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.919 
they used to take to the older ones
we<00:05:24.339> watched<00:05:24.610> somatic<00:05:25.059> cell<00:05:25.269> calculate<00:05:25.749> paid

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:25.929 
we watched somatic cell calculate paid

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.439 
we watched somatic cell calculate paid
on<00:05:26.139> it<00:05:26.319> and<00:05:26.499> we've<00:05:26.919> come<00:05:27.279> down<00:05:27.489> from<00:05:27.699> 300<00:05:28.300> right

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
on it and we've come down from 300 right

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.659 
on it and we've come down from 300 right
now<00:05:28.599> we're<00:05:28.779> running<00:05:29.050> at<00:05:29.110> 150<00:05:30.099> or<00:05:30.429> a<00:05:30.489> little

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
now we're running at 150 or a little

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.909 
now we're running at 150 or a little
below<00:05:30.819> on<00:05:31.029> somatic<00:05:31.360> since<00:05:32.319> we've<00:05:32.469> got<00:05:32.619> on<00:05:32.769> them

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
below on somatic since we've got on them

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.249 
below on somatic since we've got on them
so<00:05:33.519> right<00:05:34.119> now<00:05:34.149> we're<00:05:34.389> at<00:05:34.479> our<00:05:34.509> top<00:05:34.809> bonus<00:05:35.139> in

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
so right now we're at our top bonus in

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.579 
so right now we're at our top bonus in
our<00:05:35.319> co-op<00:05:36.300> since<00:05:37.300> fitting<00:05:37.719> the<00:05:37.869> the<00:05:38.169> impulse

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:38.589 
our co-op since fitting the the impulse

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.549 
our co-op since fitting the the impulse
system<00:05:39.069> I<00:05:39.489> think<00:05:40.360> it's<00:05:40.509> now<00:05:40.719> seven<00:05:41.139> years<00:05:41.169> ago

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
system I think it's now seven years ago

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.699 
system I think it's now seven years ago
we've<00:05:42.489> seen<00:05:42.849> tremendous<00:05:43.289> improvement<00:05:44.289> in<00:05:44.529> the

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:44.709 
we've seen tremendous improvement in the

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:47.489 
we've seen tremendous improvement in the

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
system we had was not doing us a lot of

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.649
