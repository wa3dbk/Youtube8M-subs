had<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> pretty<00:01:50.890> good<00:01:51.070> shot<00:01:51.369> at<00:01:51.610> getting<00:01:51.700> the

three-star<00:01:52.930> victory<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:54.159> turns<00:01:54.460> out<00:01:54.700> at

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
three-star victory and it turns out at

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.819 
three-star victory and it turns out at
the<00:01:55.240> end<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.780> attack<00:01:56.140> when<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.439> wrap<00:01:56.649> it

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
the end of this attack when you wrap it

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.560 
the end of this attack when you wrap it
up<00:01:56.920> here<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.579> will<00:01:57.729> see<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.149> one<00:01:58.360> hundred

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
up here you will see that one hundred

percent<00:01:58.689> damage<00:01:59.140> got<00:02:00.009> me<00:02:00.219> three<00:02:00.700> trophies

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
percent damage got me three trophies

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.480 
percent damage got me three trophies

damage going eventually and it does seem

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.620 
damage going eventually and it does seem

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.690 
time it's kind of an unusual layout it's
a<00:03:25.410> hybrid<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.950> couple<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.340> different

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
a hybrid of a couple of different

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.670 
a hybrid of a couple of different
strategies<00:03:27.239> I've<00:03:27.690> seen<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.470> ahead<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
strategies I've seen so I go ahead and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.830 
strategies I've seen so I go ahead and
drop<00:03:29.010> my<00:03:29.220> golems<00:03:29.640> wall<00:03:30.150> breakers<00:03:30.510> getting

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
drop my golems wall breakers getting

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.650 
through a perfect point in the wall
great<00:03:32.670> Junction<00:03:33.000> right<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.540> get

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
great Junction right there to get

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.080 
great Junction right there to get
through<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> can<00:03:34.890> drop<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.519> jump<00:03:35.820> spell

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and it'll allow those units to get into

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
and it'll allow those units to get into
the<00:03:38.340> core<00:03:38.670> everybody<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:40.019> now

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.830 
something you guys may have missed let's
talk<00:04:56.160> about<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.550> weather<00:04:56.760> report<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
talk about the weather report and you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.810 
talk about the weather report and you
can<00:04:57.990> probably<00:04:58.260> guess<00:04:58.650> what<00:04:58.890> it<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.040> non-stop

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
can probably guess what it is non-stop

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.640 
can probably guess what it is non-stop
clouds<00:05:00.210> for<00:05:00.510> hours<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.020> hours<00:05:01.080> but<00:05:01.440> what<00:05:01.620> I

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
clouds for hours and hours but what I

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.770 
clouds for hours and hours but what I
really<00:05:02.010> want<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.280> get<00:05:02.370> down<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.000> my<00:05:03.450> true

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
really want to get down to is my true

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.020 
really want to get down to is my true
opinion<00:05:03.960> about<00:05:04.410> n<00:05:04.710> game<00:05:05.040> trophy<00:05:05.550> rating<00:05:05.910> and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
opinion about n game trophy rating and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.600 
opinion about n game trophy rating and
that<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.420> that<00:05:06.990> top<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.710> trophy<00:05:08.130> hunting<00:05:08.430> is

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
that is that top and trophy hunting is

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.060 
that is that top and trophy hunting is
broken<00:05:09.270> now<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.750> realize<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.530> relatively

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
broken now I realize it is a relatively

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.430 
broken now I realize it is a relatively
small<00:05:11.220> pool<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:11.910> players<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.570> are<00:05:12.840> up<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.260> the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
small pool of players that are up in the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.770 
small pool of players that are up in the
clouds<00:05:13.740> like<00:05:14.040> this<00:05:14.280> maybe<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.940> thousand<00:05:15.510> or<00:05:15.630> two

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
clouds like this maybe a thousand or two

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.470 
clouds like this maybe a thousand or two
thousand<00:05:16.260> at<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.500> most<00:05:16.770> but<00:05:17.400> as<00:05:17.610> players<00:05:18.060> push

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
thousand at the most but as players push

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.840 
thousand at the most but as players push
up<00:05:18.750> towards<00:05:19.140> these<00:05:19.320> levels<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.950> feel<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.640> the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
up towards these levels I feel like the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.640 
up towards these levels I feel like the
developers<00:05:21.360> really<00:05:21.630> did<00:05:21.900> not<00:05:22.080> have<00:05:22.290> this<00:05:22.440> in

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
developers really did not have this in

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.040 
developers really did not have this in
mind<00:05:22.920> when<00:05:23.460> they<00:05:23.610> sat<00:05:23.880> down<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.480> design<00:05:24.870> the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
mind when they sat down to design the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.330 
mind when they sat down to design the
game<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.470> once<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:25.800> got<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.100> certain

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
game that once you got to a certain

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.130 
game that once you got to a certain
point<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.820> game<00:05:27.000> was<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:27.390> not<00:05:27.540> fun<00:05:27.870> anymore

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
point the game was just not fun anymore

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.200 
point the game was just not fun anymore
and<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.920> had<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.160> spend<00:05:29.370> hours<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.150> hours

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
and you had to spend hours and hours

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.050 
and you had to spend hours and hours
just<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.380> find<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.740> single<00:05:31.950> attack<00:05:32.340> so<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.550> really

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
just to find a single attack so I really

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.660 
just to find a single attack so I really
feel<00:05:33.300> like<00:05:33.330> a<00:05:33.720> change<00:05:34.380> needs<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.100> be<00:05:35.190> made<00:05:35.310> up

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
feel like a change needs to be made up

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.330 
feel like a change needs to be made up
here<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.480> problem<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.140> I<00:05:37.350> don't<00:05:37.560> know<00:05:37.920> exactly

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
here the problem is I don't know exactly

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.980 
here the problem is I don't know exactly
what<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:38.640> should<00:05:38.670> be<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:39.150> feel<00:05:39.540> like<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:39.780> really

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
what it should be I feel like it really

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.560 
what it should be I feel like it really
needs<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.440> completely<00:05:40.920> revamp<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.940> trophy
