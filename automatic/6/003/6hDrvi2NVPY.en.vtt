00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
up here in this area my hair looked like

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.720 
up here in this area my hair looked like
it<00:02:34.400> had<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.940> different<00:02:35.300> texture<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.430> I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it had this different texture going on I

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.570 
it had this different texture going on I
could<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.210> it<00:02:38.480> very<00:02:38.720> clearly<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:40.070> something

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
could see it very clearly that something

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.090 
could see it very clearly that something
was<00:02:40.730> different<00:02:41.240> with<00:02:41.390> my<00:02:41.570> hair<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.740> just<00:02:42.770> I

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
was different with my hair and I just I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.190 
was different with my hair and I just I
couldn't<00:02:43.400> figure<00:02:44.000> out<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> was<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.960> kept

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
couldn't figure out what it was I kept

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.120 
couldn't figure out what it was I kept
thinking<00:02:45.500> why<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:46.070> my<00:02:46.400> hair<00:02:46.870> tangling<00:02:47.870> why<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
thinking why is my hair tangling why is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.520 
thinking why is my hair tangling why is
it<00:02:49.370> roping<00:02:49.940> up<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.330> itself<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.080> that's<00:02:51.350> what

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
it roping up on itself and that's what

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.890 
it roping up on itself and that's what
it<00:02:51.620> looked<00:02:51.800> like<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.130> looked<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.580> streams<00:02:53.570> of

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it looked like it looked like streams of

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.930 
it looked like it looked like streams of
rope<00:02:54.760> separating<00:02:55.760> my<00:02:55.970> hair<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:58.520> know<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.880> I

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
because once it thins out it appears

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.690 
because once it thins out it appears
that<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.930> more<00:03:39.200> sebum<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:40.400> don't

the cause of it and so the only thing
that's<00:05:52.679> left<00:05:53.059> through<00:05:54.059> process<00:05:54.479> of

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
that's left through process of

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:55.159 
that's left through process of
elimination

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:21.929 
and so the process of elimination to

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:23.389 
and so the process of elimination to
figure<00:06:22.259> out<00:06:22.379> what's<00:06:22.649> going<00:06:22.979> on<00:06:23.099> what's
