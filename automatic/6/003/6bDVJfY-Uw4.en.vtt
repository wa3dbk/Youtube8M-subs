11 X wrist light really cool light I've
actually<00:00:15.960> been<00:00:16.199> using<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.619> myself<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
actually been using this myself over the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.190 
actually been using this myself over the
past<00:00:17.580> few<00:00:17.789> days<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.270> find<00:00:18.780> it<00:00:18.900> really<00:00:19.110> useful

past few days I find it really useful
big<00:00:20.130> difference<00:00:20.490> between<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
big difference between this one and the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
big difference between this one and the
original<00:00:21.780> one<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
original one is that this one has a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.670 
original one is that this one has a
swappable<00:00:23.970> cr123<00:00:24.960> battery<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.529> can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
swappable cr123 battery so you can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.170 
swappable cr123 battery so you can
actually<00:00:25.770> take<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> battery<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.550> put

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
actually take the battery out put

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.849 
actually take the battery out put
another<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.600> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.170> original<00:00:28.350> had<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
another one in the original had that

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.740 
another one in the original had that
built-in<00:00:29.190> lithium-ion<00:00:29.789> battery<00:00:30.270> pack<00:00:30.359> with
