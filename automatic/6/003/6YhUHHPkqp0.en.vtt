00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.370 
you to get more roll out of each stride
as<00:00:27.399> well<00:00:27.700> as<00:00:27.910> vibration<00:00:28.599> dampening<00:00:29.050> because

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
as well as vibration dampening because

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.859 
as well as vibration dampening because
the<00:00:29.529> more<00:00:29.739> urethane<00:00:30.250> absorbs<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.939> roughness

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
the more urethane absorbs the roughness

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.350 
the more urethane absorbs the roughness
of<00:00:31.989> the<00:00:32.050> road<00:00:32.290> it<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:32.980> an<00:00:33.100> sg9<00:00:33.760> bearing<00:00:34.239> which

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
of the road it is an sg9 bearing which

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.790 
of the road it is an sg9 bearing which
is<00:00:34.480> an<00:00:34.570> upgraded<00:00:34.990> bearing<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.380> really<00:00:35.650> good

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
is an upgraded bearing a really good

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.130 
is an upgraded bearing a really good
high<00:00:35.980> performance<00:00:36.550> bearing<00:00:36.880> it<00:00:37.150> is<00:00:37.900> the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
high performance bearing it is the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200 
high performance bearing it is the
magnesium<00:00:38.680> frame<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:39.490> magnesium<00:00:39.850> is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
magnesium frame so magnesium is

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.030 
magnesium frame so magnesium is
interesting<00:00:40.690> material<00:00:41.200> because<00:00:41.770> it<00:00:41.920> gives

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
interesting material because it gives

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040 
interesting material because it gives
you<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.370> stiffness<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.150> lightness<00:00:43.810> that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
you the stiffness and the lightness that

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.260 
you the stiffness and the lightness that
you<00:00:44.530> get<00:00:44.680> from<00:00:44.710> aluminum<00:00:45.370> but<00:00:45.760> it<00:00:45.880> also<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.180> a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
you get from aluminum but it also is a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.880 
you get from aluminum but it also is a
dampening<00:00:46.900> material<00:00:47.020> so<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.620> gives<00:00:47.740> a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
dampening material so it gives a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.220 
dampening material so it gives a
dampening<00:00:48.340> effect<00:00:48.460> also<00:00:49.120> allows<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
dampening effect also allows the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.860 
dampening effect also allows the
vibration<00:00:51.220> from<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.520> road<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:52.030> get<00:00:52.360> kind<00:00:52.810> of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
vibration from the road to get kind of

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.350 
vibration from the road to get kind of
absorbed<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.650> not<00:00:53.920> transferred<00:00:54.430> through<00:00:54.760> to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
absorbed and not transferred through to

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.690 
absorbed and not transferred through to
your<00:00:55.420> feet<00:00:55.690> in<00:00:56.170> addition<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.680> dampening<00:00:57.430> there

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
your feet in addition to dampening there

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700 
your feet in addition to dampening there
there's<00:00:57.940> also<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.239> shock<00:00:58.570> absorber<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:59.260> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
there's also a shock absorber in the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.200 
there's also a shock absorber in the
bottom<00:01:00.040> of<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.310> heel<00:01:00.550> which<00:01:00.790> gives<00:01:01.060> you<00:01:01.180> a

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
bottom of the heel which gives you a

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.330 
bottom of the heel which gives you a
neoprene<00:01:01.690> bottom<00:01:02.200> which<00:01:02.350> also<00:01:02.590> absorbs<00:01:03.130> more

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
neoprene bottom which also absorbs more

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.819

are<00:03:26.950> nice<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> also<00:03:28.300> has<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.840> neoprene<00:03:29.230> heel

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
are nice but it also has a neoprene heel

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.550 
are nice but it also has a neoprene heel
on<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.010> which<00:03:30.190> gives<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.550> even<00:03:30.760> additional

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
on it which gives you even additional

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.200 
on it which gives you even additional
vibration<00:03:32.560> absorption<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.490> between<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.910> heel

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
vibration absorption so between the heel

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.840 
vibration absorption so between the heel
the<00:03:34.960> shock<00:03:35.200> absorber<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:36.130> magnesium<00:03:36.490> frame

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the shock absorber the magnesium frame

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.940 
the shock absorber the magnesium frame
and<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.360> large<00:03:37.540> wheels<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> great

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
and the large wheels this is a great

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.890 
and the large wheels this is a great
skate<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.520> absorbing<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.180> vibration<00:03:40.810> that

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
skate for absorbing that vibration that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.950 
skate for absorbing that vibration that
you<00:03:40.960> can<00:03:41.170> feel<00:03:41.320> on<00:03:41.470> reference
