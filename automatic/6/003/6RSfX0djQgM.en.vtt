hi<00:00:00.599> I'm<00:00:00.900> Lance<00:00:01.140> Corporal<00:00:01.260> Clayton

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hi I'm Lance Corporal Clayton

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.740 
hi I'm Lance Corporal Clayton
philipovich<00:00:02.280> from<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.730> quarry<00:00:02.909> pour<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.449> I'm

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
philipovich from the quarry pour and I'm

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.170 
philipovich from the quarry pour and I'm
here<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> gear<00:00:04.980> now<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:05.910> Joint

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
here with the gear now we're at Joint

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.240 
here with the gear now we're at Joint
Base<00:00:06.319> langley-eustis<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
Base langley-eustis and we're about to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.100 
Base langley-eustis and we're about to
figure<00:00:08.429> out<00:00:08.700> what<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> takes<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.540> get<00:00:09.660> toasted

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
figure out what it takes to get toasted

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.290 
figure out what it takes to get toasted
like<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> bagel<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.550> let's<00:00:12.090> learn<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
like a bagel but first let's learn a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.820 
like a bagel but first let's learn a
little<00:00:12.360> bit<00:00:12.660> more<00:00:12.870> about<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> Active<00:00:13.740> Denial

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
little bit more about the Active Denial

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.019 
little bit more about the Active Denial
system<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> right<00:00:19.590> behind<00:00:19.920> me<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.400> AES

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
system so right behind me is the AES

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
system so right behind me is the AES
system<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
system and what we're going to do is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.019 
system and what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> ship<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> find

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we're going to go on the ship and find

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.310 
we're going to go on the ship and find
out<00:00:24.269> what<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.720> makes<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> bring<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> heat

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.810 

so<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.590> where<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> AES<00:00:35.399> system<00:00:35.730> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so this is where the AES system is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.350 
so this is where the AES system is
controlled

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
controlled

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.319 
controlled
it's<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.899> cramped<00:00:37.260> small<00:00:38.070> almost<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.210> my

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
it's very cramped small almost like my

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's very cramped small almost like my
living<00:00:39.570> quarters<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> barracks<00:00:40.200> just

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
living quarters in the barracks just

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
living quarters in the barracks just
kidding<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.180> real<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.230> very

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
kidding but for real this is very very

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
kidding but for real this is very very
cramped<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> guys<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
cramped so the guys in here is

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.330 
cramped so the guys in here is
controlling<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> monitors<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> pin

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
controlling the monitors it's got a pin

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.069 
controlling the monitors it's got a pin
pointed<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> small

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
pointed all the way down to the small

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
pointed all the way down to the small
little<00:00:49.260> crosshairs<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.340> really

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
little crosshairs and it's really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
little crosshairs and it's really
impressive<00:00:50.969> probably<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> coolest<00:00:52.020> thing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
impressive probably the coolest thing

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
impressive probably the coolest thing
about<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.309> getup<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.360> Attar<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
about this little getup is the Attar you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
about this little getup is the Attar you
like<00:00:55.140> joystick<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.920> use<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.760> control

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
like joystick that they use to control

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.959 
like joystick that they use to control
the<00:00:57.420> system<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.190> I'm<00:00:59.190> pretty<00:00:59.550> sure<00:00:59.789> I'd<00:00:59.940> be

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the system and I'm pretty sure I'd be

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
the system and I'm pretty sure I'd be
qualified<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> operate<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.350> system<00:01:01.410> because

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
qualified to operate this system because

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
qualified to operate this system because
I'm<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:02.550> good<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:02.879> call<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> duty<00:01:03.449> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I'm pretty good at call of duty so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
I'm pretty good at call of duty so
you've<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:04.710> monitors<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:05.339> here

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you've got the two monitors right here

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.340 
you've got the two monitors right here
you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.299> probably<00:01:06.420> play<00:01:06.720> split<00:01:06.990> screen<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you can probably play split screen I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.810 
you can probably play split screen I
don't<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.680> we'll<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> ask<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
don't know we'll have to ask about that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
don't know we'll have to ask about that
it's<00:01:09.330> very<00:01:09.630> cramped<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> little

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's very cramped and I'm a little

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
it's very cramped and I'm a little
claustrophobic<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.270> am<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.900> ahead

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
claustrophobic so I am going to go ahead

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
claustrophobic so I am going to go ahead
and<00:01:13.409> leave<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> professionals<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.060> get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and leave this to professionals and get

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.980 
and leave this to professionals and get
out<00:01:15.680> I'm<00:01:16.680> racing<00:01:17.130> oh<00:01:20.780> wow

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
out I'm racing oh wow

oh wow
so<00:01:26.100> sir<00:01:26.549> I've<00:01:26.790> seen<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> operated<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> one

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so sir I've seen this operated on one

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.810 
so sir I've seen this operated on one
person<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.159> how<00:01:29.280> does<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> measure<00:01:29.700> up

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
person but how does it measure up

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
person but how does it measure up
against<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> crowd<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> people<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
against a crowd of people you can use on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
against a crowd of people you can use on
the<00:01:32.340> crowd<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> move<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.090> crowd<00:01:33.270> from<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.570> area

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the crowd to move a crowd from one area

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
the crowd to move a crowd from one area
together<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> beauty<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> system

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
together this the beauty of the system

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.319 
together this the beauty of the system
you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.549> sweep<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:35.880> left<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you can actually sweep from left to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
you can actually sweep from left to
right<00:01:36.540> start<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.380> end<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.100> them

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
right start on one end and you get them

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.590 
right start on one end and you get them
the<00:01:38.340> direction<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.210> it's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the direction that you want to go it's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.719 
the direction that you want to go it's
very<00:01:39.810> useful<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> commander<00:01:41.189> moving

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
very useful to the commander moving

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
very useful to the commander moving
people<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.720> specific<00:01:43.170> direction<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
people you know specific direction so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.620 
people you know specific direction so
it's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.700> effective<00:01:45.119> weapon<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.600> a

it's a very effective weapon that has a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
it's a very effective weapon that has a
very<00:01:45.960> broad<00:01:46.229> range<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.950> things<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> do

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
very broad range of things they can do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420
